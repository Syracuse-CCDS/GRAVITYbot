275,H1 General - Ops Eve Shift End,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=80338,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Fri, 27 Sep 2024 22:09:44 -0700","TITLE: 09/28 Eve Shift: 2330-0500 UTC (1630-2200 PST) all times posted in UTC STATE of H1: Lock Acquisition INCOMING OPERATOR: Ryan C SHIFT SUMMARY: Currently relocking and at ACQUIRE_DRMI_1F. We were cleared to go into Observing by the CAL team 45 minutes ago when we were still Locked and got in 10 minutes of Observation time before losing lock from an FSS oscillation . Before that troubleshooting was being done by the calibration team for the entirety of my shift so I had just been trying to keep us locked and by running broadband measurements when they needed them. Current status of the calibration work is that they tried multiple things with ultimately no success. The things they tried have been reverted and they will be writing up their own alog and continuing work on Monday. While trying to relock after the first lockloss of my shift and this last lockloss we got stuck in READY due to IMC_LOCK being in FAULT with the DIAG_MAIN messages: "" PSL_FSS: PZT MON is high may be oscillating "" and "" PSL_FSS_TPD: RefCav transmission low fix alignment "". I tried taking the IMC to DOWN and then back to LOCKED and tried toggling the FSS loop automation OFF and then back ON but neither seemed to help. But both times the IMC was eventually able to lock but I'm not sure that it had anything to do with my toggling. Once the IMC was locked relocking went smoothly for that first relock and so far is going well this relock. So the FSS oscillations are not only causing locklosses but now are also starting to delay relocking.

Specifically I used a 21 Hz - 25 Hz blrms of auxiliary channels (CS/EX/EY HPIISIPEM & SUS channels) to try and model a strain blrms of the same frequency via lasso. In the pdf attached the first slide shows the fit from running lasso. The r^2 value was pretty low but the lasso fit does pick up some peaks in the auxiliary channels that do line up with the strain noise. In the following slides I made time series plots of the channels that lasso found to be contributing the most to the re-creation of the strain. The results are a bit hard to interpret though. There seems to be roughly 5 peaks in the aux channel blrms but only 2 major ones in the strain blrms. The top contributing aux channels are also not really from one area so I can't say that this narrowed down a potential location. However two HAM8 channels were among the top contributors (H1:ISI_HAM8_BLND_GS_X/Y). It is hard to say if that is significant or not since I am only looking at about an hours worth of data. I did a rough check on the summary pages to see if this noise happened on more than one day but at this moment I didn't find other days with this behavior. If I do come across it happening again (or if someone else notices it) I can run lasso again.

I was only able to get a small improvement by walking the steering mirrors into the pump fiber and also a small decrease in the rejected polarization in HAM7 by walking the half wave plate and quarter wave plate in the pump fiber path. The attached trend shows that since the OFI ventthe green power reflected from the OPO in both polarizations has been steadily increasing while the transmitted power has been constant which means that the launched power has had to increase. This indicates that we should try to move the OPO crystal soon.

After trying a couple of controllers it was clear that the pump broke down.Shortly after the maintenance period because of the high seismic activity locking was impossible so the vacuum team took the opportunity and swapped the pump (as normally it would have been impossible during the 4 hours of the maintenance period).The AIP was swapped with a noble diode pump - this was not exactly intentional but turned out to be a happy accident as it seemingly works much better than the Starcell or even the Galaxy pumps. However as the noble diode pump has positive polarity a positive polarity controller was needed: the only available piece is an Agilent IPC Mini (see it in the picture attached) which works well but in the MEDM screen it appears to be faulty due to its wiring differences.All in all the HAM1/HAM2 twin-annulus system was pumped with the 2 AIPs and an Aux cart - Turbo pump bundle. The noble diode pump stabilized very nicely (at 5-7E-7 Torr which is unusually low) so eventually the Aux cart Turbo pump bundle was switched off - at 6:55 pm PT.Since then the 2 AIPs continue to decrease the annulus pressure which is indeed very nice so practically we are back to normal.In the meantime Gerardo quickly modified an appropriate Varian controller to have positive polarity so at the next opportunity the vacuum team will swap it with the Agilent controller so the MEDM screen will also be normal. Note that the Aux cart - Turbo bundle remain there until this swap happens. ,"{'term': 'LHO VE', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80411,janos.csizmazia@ligo.org

Oberling R. Short M. Pirello F. Clara F. Mera Summary : We're pretty much back where we started not sure where the problem is but sure there is a problem somewhere. Since mid-September there have been an increasing number of glitches in the FSS. These are seen in the FAST channel (signal to NPRO PZT) the PC channel (signal to phase-correcting EOM) and the TEMP channel (NPRO crystal operating temperature). In addition these glitches are the suspected cause of many locklosses in the last couple of weeks and have delayed relocking due to these glitches causing FSS oscillations. In light of this we took a look at the FSS today. At the start of maintenance we unlocked the IMC leaving the FSS locked to only the Reference Cavity (RefCav). I tweaked up the alignment then went out on the floor with Fernando and Ryan to take a look at the FSS transfer function. I set up the Agilent network analyzer as normal but the TF looked like garbage I had to up the source power to 0 dBm (from our usual -20 dBm) to get a clear signal and still the TF looked wrong. See first attachment. Seeing this we filed a WP ( 12114 ) and pulled the TTFSS box from the PSL enclosure and took it to the EE shop. The current TTFSS is old and we were unable to find a test plan for it. With Marc Fil and Fernando we began stepping through the circuit diagram testing each component to make sure it was functioning as expected from the diagram (for example: ""The gain should be x is it? No but we might be injecting too high a frequency see the filter in the feedback? Lower the frequency now is the gain OK? Yes.""). This was somewhat time consuming but we could find no single component that was clearly bad or not operating properly. Visually everything looked ok nothing was obviously blown or damaged. Marc did clean some excess flux from some of the solder pads. We then checked the LO and everything looked OK there as well signal amplitude might be a little high but Fil didn't see anything worrisome. Not knowing what else to do I reinstalled the TTFSS box. Once the box was installed I took a TF this time from inside the enclosure using the Agilent unit we keep in there. The TF looked just fine and as expected see 2nd attachment. With a common gain of 15 and a fast gain of 9 the FSS has a UGF of 452 kHz with 65° of phase margin the peaks around 770 kHz are still present like normal. We decided to check the crossover (where the NPRO PZT and the phase-correcting EOM meet) at ~20 kHz (this is set with the fast gain). The 3rd attachment shows the crossover as found with a fast gain of 9. We tried raising the fast gain but this made the crossover peak larger. Lowering the fast gain made the peak smaller but also starts to raise the overall signal (see 4th and 5th attachments with a fast gain of 7 and 6 respectively). We decided to leave the fast gain at 7 for now will see how things behave (in the 3 hours since we made this change and the time of writing this alog behavior seems unchanged). The picture with the fast gain at 7 does looke a little worse than the intial one with fast gain at 9 not sure why we went back and forth between them a couple times and 9 looked worse than 7 each time (maybe I got ""lucky"" with the camera shot?). This done we transitioned the enclosure back to Science Mode. Before leaving the LVEA we tried one more thing. Since we had a successful TF measurement inside the enclosure we hooked up the Agilent unit by the PSL/ISC racks again and took a TF (since I had an apparent junk measurement with this same unit earlier in the day see that 1st attachment again). The TF looked perfectly fine matched the measurement done inside the enclosure. Not sure where the garbage TF from this morning came from at this point I can only call it ""user error of unknown origin."" So we've ended where we started sure there's a problem but not sure where it is. The current TTFSS appears to be operating correctly but the FAST signal is still glitching we even saw glitching with the IMC unlocked although Ryan reports that it ""seems"" like the glitching is more frequent when the IMC is locked (maybe IFO feedback is exacerbating an existing issue...). Marc and Fil have been testing a newer gen of TTFSS (not the same as used in SQZ as that one is not compatible with the PSL as currently wired) so once that is qualified we will try switching to it (Peter King had it working with the RefCav in the optics lab so it should work with the PSL). We'll try that next. ","{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80409,jason.oberling@ligo.org

The error reported over the weekend using the PCAL monitoring lines suggests that LHO is well within the 10% magnitude & 10 degree error window after about 15 minutes into each lock ( attached image ). Here is a link to the 'monitoring line' grafana page that we often look at to keep track of the PCALY/GDS_CALIB_STRAIN response at the monitoring line frequencies. The link covers Saturday to today. This still suggests the presence of calibration error near 33Hz that is not currently understood but as mentioned earlier it's now well within the 10%/10deg window. We think that the SRCL offset adjustment in LHO:80334 and LHO:80331 accounts for the largest contribution to the improvement of the calibration at LHO in the past week. -- What's Been Tried --No attempts by CAL (me JoeB Vlad) to correct the 33Hz error have been successful. Many things were tried throughout the week (mostly on Tuesday & Friday) that went without being properly logged. Here's a non-exhaustive list of checks we've tried (in no particular order): We cross-checked every single front end filter and gain parameter in the pyDARM model file against what's installed at LHO. Other than non-impacting foton file changes (e.g. out-of-path module changes) the only mismatch we identified is that the bias voltage in pyDARM was set to 3.3 instead of the IFO's 3.25 . We quickly implemented SRC detuning by copying the LLO setup. I did this by making on-the-fly changes to pyDARM on a local copy of the repo. I'll have to follow up with what these exact adjustments entailed. This seemed to do what we expected but it did not significantly impact the large 33Hz error. Some GDS pipeline-affecting parameters made their way into the pydarm ini at LHO. These changes were made around the time of the Cal F2F over the summer. I reverted them regenerated GSTLAL filters and installed them in the GDS pipeline. This didn't help. The commits in question are d2bfe349 8717a9f5 and dc7208e0 . We don't believe the delays being reported by the pyDARM fits of the actuation delay on the PUM stage. We made adjustments to the fitting parameters for this stage to increase the fit range to roughly 400Hz in the hopes that pyDARM would produce a somewhat believable number. More details on this item as time allows we are going to tune our injections to reduce uncertainty on these measurements in particular. This tuning will need to be done in tandem with other tunings (e.g. reducing PCAL at low frequencies to avoid leakage from polluting simultaneous higher frequency measurements). We made similar adjustments to the sensing fit parameters. We extended the low end of the fit range to better capture the detuning near 10Hz in the fit. Once it approached midnight on Friday night we reverted everything and left the IFO back in the state we found it in. This process is also not straightforward and requires creating a new 'fake' pyDARM report each time due recently-discovered bugs in the pyDARM infrastructure. This bug is being tracked here . --What Changed?--We think the SRC change(s) on September 5 ( LHO:79929 also discussed in LHO:79903 ) line up well with the time frame at which the 33Hz error issue popped up. Here is a screenshot showing that the 33Hz error showed up on September 5. I've also attached a shot of ndscope showing the SRCL offset change on 09/05 from -175cts to -290cts here . cal_better_after_srcl_changed.png shows the error tracked by the monitoring lines before and after the SRCL offset was changed back to -190cts.

If they are it requests them to unlock and relock. This is to force them into a better place before we go into observing. I've added PMC to the PZT_checker will relock if it's outside of 15-85V. Full range is 0-100V. SQZ_MANAGER reloaded. Plan to take GRD though DOWN and back to FDS. ,"{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80371,camilla.compton@ligo.org

This has happened several times before where Guardian is usually successful in bringing things back and H1 returns to observing within minutes so I'm not convinced this is the cause of the lockloss. However when looking at Guardian logs around this time I noticed one of the first things that could indicate a cause for a lockloss was from the IMC_LOCK Guardian where at 04:54:00 UTC it reported ""1st loop is saturated"" and opened the ISS second loop. While this process was happening over the course of several milliseconds the lockloss occurred. Indeed it seems the drive to the ISS AOM and the secondloop output suddenly dropped right before the first loop opened but I don't notice a significant change in the diffracted power at this time (see attached screenshot). Unsure as of yet why this would've happened to cause this lockloss. Other than the ISS I don't notice any other obvious cause for this lockloss.

There wasn’t really much noise in DARM that was present at the X arm manifold. More noise can be seen on the Y arm but it seems like it is less than the end stations. First Valera and I tried shaking the Manifold with both shaker and human injections at 0.3 Hz. This produced nothing in DARM. We also tried to bang on and push/pull the tube around the manifold. This produced a resonant peak near 100 Hz but nothing like the microseism scatter noise we were hunting or the noise recently found at the X end . ( See 0.3 Hz tests plots ) I then performed a 1-3 Hz Sweep a 3-10 Hz Sweep a 5.43 Hz line 8.75 Hz line and a 21.43 Hz line. These tests replicate what we performed on the X manifold. For the Y-arm shaking I might have been too aggressive with the gain for the sweeps as some harmonics were present. These harmonics can come from the shaker connection to the tube if it is loose but the connection seemed good when Valera and I were out on the floor so maybe I just was shaking a little too hard. Despite the harmonics I believe that the noise found in our shakes still supports that the manifold scattering is largest at the End Stations followed by the CS Y manifold and then the CS X manifold. 1-3 Hz sweep showed up in the 60-100 Hz DARM BLRMS but was hard to pick out in a DARM Spectogram. ( SEE 1-3 Hz plots ) 3-10 Hz also elevated the 60-100 Hz DARM BLRMS and showed some noise in DARM but less than was seen for the End Station Sweeps . Of particular note are the two bumps in the DARM BLRMS around 7 and 8 Hz. ( SEE 3-10 Hz plots ). Each line injection in DARM produced somewhat similar noise in DARM as each other. The 8.75 Hz injection was to try and match where the excess noise was present in the sweep.

Here are two sets of instructions one that can be used while in observing to adjust this and one that can be done when we loose lock or are out of observing for some other reason. For these first few days please follow the out of observing instructions when relocking if this hasn't been done in the last few hours and please try to do it in the last few hours of the evening shift so that the temperature is close to well tuned at the start of the owl shift. Out of observing instructions (to be done while recovering from a lockloss can be done while ISC_LOCK is locking the IFO) ( screenshot ) : Make sure that ISC_LOCK will not set SQZ_MANAGER request to INJECT_SQZ by setting the request to ADS_TO_CAMERAs or any lower state. From sitemap SQZ_OVERVIEW set SQZ MANGER request to LOCKED_SEED_NLG. from the purple !SQZ scopes button open the NLG scope Once the SQZ manger is in LOCKED_SEED_NLG you should see that the red OPO_IR_TRANS trace on the scope is oscillating. Adjust the OPO temperature using the slider which is right under the purple SQZ scopes button to maximize the peak of the oscillations. SET_SQZ MANGER request back to FDS_READY_IFO and once that's ready you can set the ISC_LOCK request to nominal low noise. Before going to observing you can adjust the squeezing angle by requesting SQZ_MANAGER to SCAN_SQZANG. It is best practice to do this after the IFO has thermalized but it can be done early in the lock. If lock stretches are long and this has been done only early in the lock it may need adjusting for a thermalized IFO . Right now the squeezing angle has a strong frequency dependence early in the lock stretch so let's not adjust it until the IFO has been locked for at least an hour. In observing instructions: Both the OPO temperature and the SQZ phase are ignored in SDF and can be adjusted while we are in observing but it's important to log the times of any adjustments made. To adjust the temperature in full lock go to the purple SQZ_SCOPE button and choose the OPO temp scope adjust the OPO temperature to maximize CLF_REFL_RF6_ABS (the green trace). After doing this it might be necessary to adjust the SQZ PHASE which can be adjusted in steps of 5 degrees or so. Set this to maximize the squeezing level which you can do by watching the DARM FDS dtt template. It is available from the SQZ DTT purple button or on NUC33. It is easiest to adjust this for high frequency squeezing (around 1kHz) this should get you close to good squeezing at 100 Hz. Changes made to make this easier (Thanks Corey for beta testing the instructions): I've commented out the request to SQZ_MANGER that ISC_LOCK makes in low noise length control because that took control of the squeezer from Corey when he was giving these instructions a trial. The OPO temp is not monitored in SDF I removed the goto= True from the LOCK_FSS state. This will force SQZ_MANAGER to go through down after the NLG measurement (and turn off the seed PZT ramp).

Then there is a larger glitch that happened about 1 second before lockloss where POP18 drops below the trigger threshold and the DRMI guardian goes to DOWN at the same time the ALS Y arm looses green lock which then unlocks the ALS X arm. This glitch doesn't seem to be cause by the DRMI ASC although we were in the process of engaging that ASC when it happened. It also isn't due to the BS ISI isolation coming on which hadn't happened yet. Edit: I looked into a second lockloss from PRMI: 1412095134 this one is different in that it happens very quickly and PRMI and ALS signals drop out at close to the same time.

WP 12116 12117 . Last done in October 2023: 73524 . Followed instructions from 73524 65684 with additional notes below. Took SQZT7 area to local laser hazard and plugged straight into the OPO_IR_PD for our red signal and the OPO_TRANS PD for our green signal. Trying to take the signals from the outside of the table or the SQZ racks was confusing. Setup: Old style function generator offset 4.5V for a 1-9V scan at 10Hz. Oscilloscope and long BNCs/adapters: plug into function generator OPO_IR_PD and the OPO_TRANS photodetectors inside SQZT7. PZT driver MDT694 which has 0-150V output for 0-10V input connected this to the PZT1 connector in the back of the chassis using the adapter for PZT2 (note this means that the PZT2 offset we had been keeping at +10V was 0V for this measurements controlled by CLF SLOWOUTOFS 65535 ). Wincam dell laptop and gray E-870 PI shift driver box (stored in LVEA SQZ cabinet) and the OPO crystal cable remains attached +X HAM7 flange. What we did: After set up once we could see both mode scans on the oscilloscope we injected the seed beam and reduced green power from 30mW to 6mW to avoid pumping too much. Pico wasn't working: 80449 . Adjusted temperature to get red and green co-resonance. Plot attached of before spot move. In alog 73524 we used the OPO spot 2nd from the left. We moved (32 x 50 steps to right then 2 x 10 steps to right) to the next spot with a red-green co-resonance 3rd from the left. Plot attached. Increased the green power back to 25mW then 30mW and then things got confusing: we were seeing rapidly changing strange signals and negatives on OPO_TRANS channel. Beckhoff version of the channels looked better. We eventually found that the whitening filters must have been saturating and giving us strange signals. We increased SHG ISS drivepoint to 10V allowing us to use a lower green pump this showed that the high green pump was our issues. Then reduced the SHG power to 14mW while the SHG ISS drivepoint was in the middle of the range at 5V. When the ISS was engaged it could keep the opo_grTrans_setpiont_uW to 80uW with the controlmon around 6 and SHG_LAUNCH ~11.5mW. This is much less than the 30mW we needed this morning so this new crystal spot is much less lossy. OPO started to oscillate when we locked it so we reduced the OPO gain from -4 to -8 and accepted in sdf. Sheila set the opo_grTrans_setpiont_uW to 80uW in sqzparams.py and we measured the NLG to be 11 (Amplified / Un-amplified = 0.098/0.0089 see 76542 ). Ran SCAN_SQZ_ALGNMENT and SCAN_SQZ_ANG. This gave us >4dB of squeezing at high frequency. We left PZT2 (CLF SLOWOUTOFS) at 0V see 80450 . Today 75uW OPO trans power corresponded to 0.945 on the OPO refl diode last night that was 4.161mW on OPO refl diode. Meaning after this spot move we now need to inject a lot less power into the OPO to get the same output power. ,"{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80451,camilla.compton@ligo.org

We then went to no squeezing and set the offset back to it's nominal value and saw reduced squeezing when we reinjected squeezing. We could recover the better squeezing level by slowly stepping this offset back to 0V. We think that this could be because the PZT setting changes the alignment of the OPO and the squeezed beam coming out of it. (which also changes the squeezing angle). A similar effect was seen with PZT1 in 80396 and 78529 . It would be interesting another time to try changing this offset and seeing if we can recover squeezing by readjusting alignment and squeezing angle.,"{'term': 'H1 SQZ', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80450,sheila.dwyer@ligo.org

There was some trial and error here mainly due to the difficulty in matching the phase as well as the rising gain of the transfer function above 100 Hz which you can see in this plot . This results in the best fit having some high Q pole just above 250 Hz and of course the usual struggle to keep the gain low below 10 Hz. I found better results when I limited the gain between 1 and 10 Hz to a maximum of 0.5 and also reduced my fit range to go between 10 and 60 Hz which is where the sensitivity improvement is required and then limited the gain from 100-1000 Hz to 0.02. PRCL is limiting the noise up to 30 Hz and far below th noise floor around 100 Hz so it's probably ok to keep the PRCL noise the same or just slightly worse above 60 Hz ( NB alog ). Finally with Gabriele's help I found a fit that worked! Here is the injection comparison with no feedforward and the new feedforward. I updated the DARM traces so you can see that the PRCL contribution to DARM is slightly worse around 100 Hz but much better up to 60 Hz by up to a factor of 10. The new filter is in FM7 (I have triple checked this!) and I have added it to the guardian and SDFed this in observe ( screenshot ). I did some chopping of the PRCL FF to check the improvement in DARM see plot . I think there is improvement between 20-30 Hz but it's hard to tell. I set out to rerun the noise budget injection of PRCL so we could remake the plots but there was a lockloss while I was measuring (I think because people were on the floor?). I don't think the lockloss was from the NB injection. ","{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80445,elenna.capote@ligo.org

Summary Of The Last 2-Years (Alphabetical list of people who have helped/been involved: C.Gray J.Kissel R.McCarthy J.Oberling T.Sadecki R.Savage TJ Shaffer R.Short B.Weaver) Upgrade To 200W Laser (Fall 2022) Until recently the last batch of Pulled Fibers were pulled in Fall 2022. At this time the Fiber Puller started having issues related to the laser ( f100 CO2 laser by Synrad 100W and 10600um)--this laser was well over a dozen years old and at the end of its operational life. Higher power lasers had already been purchased for the Fiber Puller about 5-years ago in preparation for an upgrade and a possible need to pull thicker diameter silica fibers for heavier suspensions. Because of this it was decided to upgrade the Fiber Puller with one of these 200W lasers ( f201 CO2 laser by Synrad 200W and 10600um). The 200W laser is bigger than the previous laser and because of this the back of this laser hangs off the edge of the optics table but Rick made a nice breadboard which offers a platform to support the back of this laser (see image1) . Cabinets and furniture were removed along the wall to allow extra space to for walking around this area of the lab. After RyanS and I installed the new laser & re-did the chiller plumbing we moved on to aligning the laser into the Fiber Puller. Since alignment work was next we took this opportunity to swap in new upper & lower conical mirrors in the Fiber Puller (Travis ordered these a while ago.). Alignment Work Begins (2023-2024) Then with the help of Karl Toland's thesis (Chapter 2) we started Fiber Puller alignment. This included Mechanical checks of the Fiber Puller which looked mostly OK it was noticed there is a slight tilt forward of the tower. We decided to not change this. The periscope which points the beam into the Fiber Puller was reconfigured to allow its translation stages (namely the horizontal one) to have better adjustability for pointing into the Fiber Puller--previously the horizontal translation stage only moved forward and back which did not allow for horizontal translations of the beam into the Fiber Puller (this only required us to rotate the translation stage 90deg). After this it was all optical alignment work and this proved to be non-trivial. Additionally one of the gold mirrors was burned. This mirror had a glass substrate so it was replaced with a gold mirror with a copper substrate (also took this opportunity to replace several dirty input gold mirrors). Then there was several months of no progress with alignment. Eventually Travis & Jason checked out the status of alignment. And in Aug 2024 Jason was able to give us a decent looking beam on our stock and after almost 2-years fibers were finally pulled again! Return To Fiber Pulling! ...For A Little While. Between Aug 2-20th six fibers were pulled (4 passes & 2 fails). At this point while preparing to pull another fiber one of the 1/8"" ID tubing to the shutter burst on Aug 20 2024. NOTE: Here I will paste in the email summary I sent to the group on Sept 26th. Recovery From The Plumbing Failure On Aug 20 2024 [start of email] Summary : After the 1/8"" chilling hose burst (8/20) weeks were spent with recovery and buying new plumbing hardware. There is now better hosing for the shutter + beam bender (mirror mount) and most of the fittings have been replaced with push-to-connects (excepted for barbed fitting of the beam bender (see image 6) ). We have been running the chiller w/ new plumbing since 9/17/2024. For the plumbing fix above this was done in-situ without removing the shutter or mirror mount with the hopes of preserving the alignment but first looks at alignment by myself and Jason at separate times did see an alignment change on our fiber stock target. On Sept 25th we were both able to work on the Fiber Puller and Jason was able to get us a decent alignment back we pulled our first fiber since the 8/20 chiller plumbing link---and this fiber also passed on 9/26! PLUMBING (see image 5) : The backstory is years ago a water-cooled shutter & mirror mount were installed (1/8"" ID plumbing using a mix of push-to-connect & barbed fittings) for the Fiber Puller. The water-cooled shutter & mirror mount were added in series to the laser (which has 1/2""OD tubing) via an aluminum manifold. During the 100W to 200W laser swap by RyanS and I we discovered everything downstream of the laser (1/8"" ID stuff) had been clogged (most likely for years) from the manifold downstream to the shutter + mirror mount. This led to us replacing all lines cleaning the manifold and starting to use OptiShield with the chiller water with hopes of preventing any corrosion clogs. This worked for a while during the upgrade and even through six NEW fibers pulled in August but after the 6 th fiber there was a huge burst in the tubing at the shutter. This led to repair work with a few issues/notes observed: Non-Water Tubing FAIL : The line which failed (I reordered what was originally installed) was very bendy and easy to work with. BUT over several purchase orders it was noticed that this line was rated for ""air"" use. This led to being more mindful of types of tubing. Firstly making sure we had (1) water-rated tubing and also (2) tubing with decent max-pressure ratings. Perhaps overkill but ultimately went with tubing with max pressure rating of 120psi. This new tubing was definitely much stiffer than the previous tubing. Metric & Inch : Previously--between the manifold shutter and beam-bender we had a mix of different fitting connections. Additionally because we were looking for: water-rated high max-pressure rating consistent fittings etc it limited options. Ultimately went with metric tubing + push-to-connect fittings (see image 4) . Able to make this change for everything except for the mirror mount ( it remained with its barbed fittings but it has 3 barbs and it feels like a good connection ). Additionally our pressures are pretty low (under 50psi)---not measured for the new 6mm lines but the chiller's pressure dial reads ~25psi for the system . 90deg Elbow Fittings Under Shutter (see images 2 & 3) : When the group checked out this plumbing work a few weeks ago TJ suggested elbow fittings under the shutter (mainly because this is where the previous tubing burst and the lines do take a bit of bend under the shutter here). New push-to-connect elbows were added. Pressure/Flow values & Adding Sensors : Had not really paid attention to what the pressure & flow of the system are through all this work but after the failure it was brought up by Travis and Jason. We have a Flow sensor on the supply line ( downriver from the laser) and a pressure gauge (also on supply side at the chiller). Just for a rough idea of numbers here are values observed: Flow sensor: this ran at 1.0gpm with just the laser but after the new 6mmOD system was added it's increased to 2.0gpm Pressure gauge: was running around 30psi at some points during the rework (more consistently at 26psi after the new 6mmOD system added) TO DO list: More Sensors! Would be nice to add more flow/pressure sensors at more points in the plumbing system--especially for the 6mmOD lines. With focus on getting operation back I did not get a chance to look into ordering this but we should do this at some point. ALIGNMENT Once Again : For all of the plumbing work above I opted to do it ""in situ"" by not ""touching"" the shutter or beam bender (I did not remove them from the beam path and only connected/disconnected their tubing)---this was all in the hopes of not changing the alignment---we had a nice alignment which produced decent fibers in August! Although I attempted to be careful with all of the plumbing work above first checks by both myself and Jason later showed we were off a little when we looked at the fiber stock target with the red beam. [On Sept 25 2024] Jason and I were both able to work together in the fiber lab. Here are some of the notes I took while Jason did his alignment magic! Coalignment of shutter's red beam with the main CO2 beam : It looked decent via a check of the co-alignment-beam-check path (via flipper mirror) that Jason and RyanS added earlier this summer. We made an ever-so-slightly small change via the shutter red-beam adjustment screws. Alignment Attempt #1 : Red beam alignment Jason went through alignment touch-up via the periscope mirrors. He was quickly able to get a decent beam on the fiber stock target. At this point he checked to see how this beam looked with the alignment irises which have been in place all the while (between the periscope and Fiber Puller). After aligning beam to the irises he once again had a decent beam on the fiber stock. In both cases there was a ""hot spot"" noted on the ""back"" side of the fiber stock. CO2 beam alignment With the main CO2 beam on a new fiber stock we needed to turn the power up to about 55-60% on the laser to be able to see the beam via the cameras in the Labview app. With the cameras I tweaked the (periscope mirrors) to get a better alignment (which allowed us to lower the power to about 50%). Jason had a try at tweaking alignment via the cameras (I believe this was his first chance getting to do this—especially since the side camera was better-focused on our stock back in August). We were able to optimize a little more but it still looked not great (see image 7) . I thought it might have looked like what we had when we were pulling fibers in August but we could clearly see it wasn't great. There was an angle on the fiber stock and the rear camera could clearly see the angle even more. I mentioned we could probably pull a fiber but we'd definitely have to increase the laser power. We did not pull a fiber however. We broke for lunch with hopes at more checks in the afternoon. Alignment Attempt #2 With Mechanical Offset Check Between Top & Bottom Clamp Translation Stages : Translation Stages : Thinking there was still something amiss mechanically Jason wanted to check the Top & Bottom Clamp Translation Stages. We do this using a special tool to set the Upper translation stage and the Lower translation stage (the latter we have not touched for a while). Jason went through several iterations of making small adjustments to both the upper and lower translation stages (see image 8) . On one of the final adjustments he intentionally overshot the upper translation stages. This was to hopefully help us later (it did!). Tower : NOTE: At this point Jason continued with mechanical checks and we looked at the Tower with a bubble level. There is an observable tilt forward of the tower albeit small. (this is mentioned above) Karl's thesis mentions this should be fixed but there are no tolerances given or go/no go values. And it's not clear how to do this without a major change to the system. There are alot of surface-to-surface mechanical contacts in the tower so one would need to loosen lots of bolts and then possibly install shims and retorque down everything. Anyway---a big job. Since it is a small tilt we are just noting it and decided to move on. In the future the Fiber Puller will need to be upgraded to a taller tower this will definitely give us the opportunity to remove the tilt from the tower (note: This could be a reason for [the known years-long issue of ] why we always have to make adjustments to the upper clamp translation stage almost every time we pull a fiber). Red beam alignment Once again Jason very quickly went through an alignment onto our fiber stock. One nice thing: no ""hot spot"" on back side of stock! CO2 beam alignment A new stock was installed and we heated it. We could clearly see the beam with the cameras at a lower power of 45%! (lower power than Attempt #1! Our 1st good sign!) And the 2nd good signs was the forward & back alignment of the stock was GOOD (in other words there was not an offset in this direction! Another sign the translation stage mechanical checks did us good!). The stock did show an offset in the other direction (""left/right"") so the translation stage was adjusted accordingly. Additionally the spot on the stock looked MUCH better on the cameras (3rd good sign! [see image 9] ). There were minimal angles seen with the ""ring spot"" on the stock! Touched up the alignment a little more but it was already better than how we looked in the morning. We were ready to pull! Vaporization Before pulling wanted to get an idea of what laser power we could go up to before silica vaporization begins. Ryan can correct me here but I believe Alan told us we should do pulls at laser powers just lower than the laser power when silica vaporization occurs. The laser power was slowly ramped up and I started seeing vaporization somewhere around 75-80% (it was very bright on the stock). Polish & Pull Not sure of what is the ideal values to use here but to just do it went with: Polish power = 55.5% Pull power = 65.0% Although late in the afternoon we went through the whole process. Fiber was profiled and then analyzed: PASSED! It had a bit of a low fundamental = 493.892 Hz This is where we ended for that day. Have continued to pull more fibers and get more data points with an eye on the fundamental (violin) mode frequencies. One knob we have here are those Polish & Pull powers. NOTE: A reminder that even with the 100W laser toward the end our fibers have been populating the lower range of violin mode frequencies (see fiber table ). Something to think about. Additional Note On Alignment & Power With our nice alignment it should also be noted we are still running at higher powers than what we are used to (which was at 85% or ~85W with the 100W). With the current 200W laser we were running at ~140W in Aug for pulls and yesterday we were at ~135W. This would point to a the overall alignment in need of some improvement.

This FSS issue seems to be having a serious impact on our duty cycle. I had a helpful conversation with Rick this afternoon about this issue he sugested that we trying looking for the glitches in other places in the PSL so that we could think about tests where we don't run some of the feedback servos and see if we still see the issue. I made an ndscope template with all the PSL fast channels I could find it is saved in sheila.dwyer/ndscope/PSL/PSL_fast_channels.yaml Looking at 1412111658 with this scope it looks like several of these channels that we are saving at a fast rate might not be connected for example the OSC and HPL channels are around 0. The only other channel that clearly shows these glitches is H1:PSL-PWR_NPRO_OUT_DQ. Request for operators: If you are having locking difficulties over the weekend it may be due to the PSL/FSS problems. To help narrow down the cause of the problem one could sit for an hour or two with the FSS unlocked and the ISS unlocked. If the glitches show up in the NPRO channel even without these servos locked then we will know that the problem is not from the FSS but from the NPRO.

Then we went to the diode room and followed instructions that Ryan Short gave me to turn off the two amplifiers in order then the shutter and then we turned the NPRO off. We went to the rack disconnected the cables and turned the NPRO on by turning on the button on the controller box. This conntroller doesn't have a switch on the front panel for the noise eater it was replaced by a cable which is no longer used.

I went through the noise budget code and found that these plots were made without median averaging. However changing the code to use median averaging is a simple matter of uncommenting one line of code in /ligo/gitcommon/NoiseBudget/aligoNB/aligoNB/common/utils.py that governs how the PSD is calculated for the noise budget. I reran the darm_integral_compare code using median averaging. The result shows much less difference in the noise at low frequency between these two times. The range is still improved from 10-50 Hz but there is a small drop in the range between 50-60 Hz. I still think the change from 10-30 Hz is likely due to PRCL. ,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80538,elenna.capote@ligo.org

Based on the previous noise budget measurements and the change in the coherence of PRCL from Sept 28 to Oct 5 I think the improvement in DARM from 10-30 Hz is likely due to the PRCL improvement.

New SQZ ASC using AS42 signals with feedback to ZM4 and ZM6 tested and implemented. We still need to watch that this can keep a good SQZ alignment during thermalization. In O4a we used a SQZ ASC with ZM5/6 we have not had a SQZ ASC for the majority of O4b. Prep to improve SQZ: No squeezing from 15:31:30 to 15:41:30UTC. Adjusted OPO temperature following no observing instructions in 80461 . Measured NLG to be 12.8. (0.1165/0.0091) following 76542 . This improved the squeezing from 2.5dB above 300Hz to 3dB at 300Hz and 4.2bD above 1kHz. Testing ASC from 80373 : Ran the ""reset as42 nosqz"" offsets script while in no sqz. SDF accepted. Put the input matrices form 80373 into SQZ ASC and checked they were diagonalized correctly by moving ZM4/6 in turn and watching ASC_POZ/ANG input signals. ZM4 pitch wasn't completely diagonalized but that others looked good. Reduced ASC_WFS gain from 0.1 to 0.05 cleared histories set all ASC_POS/ANG gains to 1 and one at a time turned on the inputs. We had some troubleshooting with POS_Y but there was a minus sign inside one of the filter banks we hadn't seen. In this troubleshooting we found the matrix was mostly diagonal so removed the cross-coupling terms for the YAW input matrix. Found WFS gain is better with lower WFS gain to 0.01 so we took a factor of 100 for the input matrix and left H1:SQZ-ASC_WFS_GAIN at 0.5. Accepted all in sdf. And edited sqzparams and reloaded SQZ_MANAGERT to turn on SQZ ASC. To test we tried the ""offload AS42 ASC"" script with the plan to compare the AS42 alignment with the alignment from the guardians scan SQZ alignment. The script didn't work as expected it's hard-coded to offload ZM45/6 rather than ZM4/6 that we are now using we should fix this or go back to using ther guardian states. After turning off the ASC and running again to clear histories this caused a lockloss probably as ZM6 P moved 60urad in 0.3s. See attached lockloss plot .

We suspected coupling at HAM1 and I tested this recently using local injections and the beating shaker technique. With local injections at HAM1 using shakers and HEPI we can produce much larger signals at the HAM1 table top then at the PSL or HAM2. The coupling site will likely have the same ratio of locally injected peaks to distant equipment peaks in its vibration sensors as the ratio of these peaks in DARM. The figure shows that the ratio of the injected peak at 25 Hz to the Air Handler peak at 26.35 Hz is consistent with coupling at HAM1 but not HAM2 (or any place else – most other potential coupling sites don’t even detect the peak injected locally at HAM1) The figure also shows that the beats from the beating shakers matched DARM at the HAM1 table top but could also be consistent with coupling at HAM2 so this technique as implemented gave a consistency check but did not discrimate well between HAM1 and 2.

The figure shows that scattering noise continues to be quite sensitive to the CP yaw on a 20 microradian scale. While re-checks did not previously suggest the need for a change after the initial setting ( 76969 ) the figure shows that this time the check suggests a new setting. The original setting -250 is now in a coupling peak. I suggest changing it to -325 (see figure). The second page of the figure shows that the coupling peaks are very repeatable.

BOSEM drift trends were reported in LLO aLOG entry 73180 . Initially we debugged a failure to actuate on the M1 SIDE channel for which swapping the BOSEM resolved the fault (replacement BOSEM S1900661). We measured BOSEM open-lights for the SIDE channel calculated gains and offsets and then centered the flag.We manually took DTT undamped TFs on the BBSS and then exported to Matlab.See 2024-10-07_1400_X2SUSBS_M1_ALL_TFs below for the first X2 (LLO) BBSS measurement.This has been compared with a measurement made at X1 (LHO) below. The plot key is as follows:-Blue Trace = Model (bbssopt).Orange Trace = X1 BS M1 (2024-08-30_2300). M1 LHO *net* blade heights average out to d1 = -1.5mmMagenta Trace = X2 BS M1 (2024-10-07_1400). M1 1st LLO measurement blade heights average out to d1 = -2.0mmTFs are looking fairly consistent between the sites and I believe we plan to change the d1 and remeasure. EDIT: Quick summary as also noted by Jeff K there are what appear to be roll-modes cross-coupling into the vertical DoF TF which is not observed at LHO so this should be looked into.

4801,L1 ISC - Analysis of Individual TR ERM PDs During Loud Glitches,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=73447,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Mon, 07 Oct 2024 18:10:29 -0500",[Tabata Gaby] Summary: the ERM PDs ( alog 72968 ) have correlations with DARM during loud glitches and these correlations are in most cases only with the X arm or only with the Y arm. The signals of individual PDs increase during loud glitches consistent with 'dust' scattering light back to the ERM PDs and forward to DARM. According to the OmegaScan analysis in most cases at least three PDs are affected during a loud glitch In the alog 73024 we analyzed the coincidences of Loud Glitches with TR ERM PDs through the SUM channels (ASC-X_TR_ERM_NSUM_OUT_DQ/ASC-Y_TR_ERM_NSUM_OUT_DQ). Here we present a quick overview of the data for the four individual PDs (L1:ISC-X_TR_ERM_SEG*_OUT_DQ/L1:ISC-Y_TR_ERM_SEG*_OUT_DQ) available from September 17th ( alog 73135 ). For the analysis we selected the 200 loudest glitches from September 18 to September 30. The lowest SNR in this dataset was 182. - Looking at the raw normalized time series the amplitude of the signal in the PDs goes up in most cases. This indicates that if dust is causing this it is probably scattering the light rather than blocking it. Image 1 presents an example where PD1 (blue) and PD3 (salmon) show an increase in signal during the presence of a loud glitch in DARM (black). - Image 2 shows the SNR behavior (y-axis) for each PD in the Y arm for 100 glitches (x-axis). We can see that they go up and down together most of the time suggesting that most of the PDs witness the signal. Interestingly PD3 in the Y arm seems to have the highest SNR in most cases as well. - Figure 3 presents the correlation from OmegaScan for the SUM channels for each arm. This illustrates the fact that when there is a high correlation with the X arm there is a low correlation with the Y arm and vice versa. In the previous dataset ( alog 73024) the number of coincidences with the Y arm was very similar to those with the X arm however according to OmegaScan the PDs in the Y arm show more correlations in this dataset. - From the plot in Figure 3 we set a threshold for the correlation equal to 10. Based on this threshold we calculated the percentage of PDs that have correlations above 10. As illustrated in Figure 4 more than 75% of the analyzed loud glitches correlate with at least three PDs which aligns with the plot presented in Figure 3 . We will further investigate this dataset including an analysis of the delays among the affected individual PDs. In addition we will calculate the coherence to cross-check with OmegaScan.

The rationale is as follows:1. The lines that appear during this short test appear to be mostly comb-like but that is not completely understood. Further investigations with more data collected would be required in order to assess what other line contamination appears while temporary AC is on. In addition we'd need to reallocate our overworked/shallow pool of personnel in order to separately characterize this temporary configuration.2. Noise mitigation efforts take a range of possibilities: 2a. vetoing the entire time the temporary AC unit is on (the sledgehammer) is fairly straightforward but it would mean the complete loss of the usefulness of the data collected during this time. We would rather not have to take this approach 2b. vetoing artifacts that appear during this interval which basically means repeating the lines-list creation but just for this short stretch of time. Considering it has taken a significant effort for the O4a epoch and that we're already working on other lines of investigation we'd rather not have to separately assess the temporary AC unit on time 2c. line subtraction has been proposed but we are not convinced that noise subtraction means that the data is now no longer contaminated. Even subtraction by a factor of 1000 means that there could still be contamination (we see evidence of this for the calibration lines for example). Thus we do not regard line subtraction as a promised solution. In addition someone would need to carry out this (non-trivial) subtraction work.3. We advocate for additional efforts to reduce noise coupling before the data is contaminated and we have to take on the heavy burden to additionally characterize the time the temporary AC unit is on. If these are successful then we do not have to treat this time interval in any special way. Hopefully reducing noise coupling by a factor of 100 is enough for the CW group. I also want to raise the issue that the Vela pulsar signal is putatively at approximately 22 Hz. We do not want to raise the noise floor in this region at all because it is high-profile potential CW source.

Overall terrible shift and locking due to many affected suspension sliders due to a dolphin crash at 22:30 UTC (around 4:30 PM). Not one minute spent in observing due to this crash that somehow changed everything. Here's a rough story: IR Not Found: IR was not found. Went into Input_Align in Initial_Alignment bright eyed and optimistic only to realize that this was also not working. Checked the ALS Overview to find that we were getting a beatnote and that guardian had indeed swept the full frequency range without finding any resonances. After some finagling and calling Daniel he pointed me to check IMs and PRs and indeed IM4 and PR2 were off in P and Y so I trended those values and then set them to their original. We were able to Find IR complete initial alignment and went all the way up to NLN. Unable to SQZ: Was happy to finally get to NLN (2:07 UTC) but then the SQZ was unable to lock FC.

I plotted the last eight seconds before lockloss for the various lockloss times. This time I split up the times into different graphs based on if the DC2 max displacement from zero in the last second before lockloss was above 0.06 (based on the histogram in previous comment): Greater = the max displacement is greater than 0.06 Less = the max displacement is less than 0.06. However I discovered that some of the locklosses that are above 0.06 for the DC2 channel are failing the logic test in the code: getting considered as having a max displacement less than 0.06 and getting plotted on the lower plots. I wonder if this is also happening in the histograms but this would only mean that we are underestimating the number of locklosses above the threshold. This could be suppressing possible bimodal distributions for other histograms as well. (Looking into debugging this) I split the locklosses into 5groups of 8 and 1 group of 5 to make it easier to distinghuish between the lines in the plots.

Settings before we started: Laser diode A set temperature 18.3C Laser diode B set temperature 15.99C laser diode injection current 2.134 Amps laser crystal set temperature 26.04 C laser crystal actual temperature 26.10 C. We went to the diode room and followed the notes from the procedure Ryan Short outlined to me to shut down the amplifiers turning off amp2 then amp1 then closing the shutter then we went one step beyond his instructions and shut off the NPRO. We swapped the controller with all the cables including the interlock. When we powered on S2200008 laser diode A temperature was set to 17.14 B set to 22.96C. We adjusted the pots on the front panel until they matched the values we had written down from the original controller. We turned the knob on the front panel for the injection current to 0. Rick and I went to the laser diode room and turned the NPRO back on Keita confirmed that this turned on the controller. We noticed that the laser diode 1 and 2 set temps were what we had set them to be by adjusting the pots for A and B but the act temp readbacks weren't matching we confirmed with photos that with the original controller the set and actual temps matched. (I will attach a photo of this state). At the rack Ketia turned the injection current up to about 100mA this didn't change the temperature readbacks. We had a discussion with Matt Heinze who agreed this is probably a readback issue and that it was safe to keep going. We think that this is because we haven't adjusted the pots on the LIGO daughter board following T1900456 . Keita slowly turned up the injection current knob while Rick and I watched from the diode room the NPRO power came back to 1.8W which was the same as before. The laser diode act power readbacks for diode 1 says 3.6W while it was 5W with the original controller and diode 2 says 2.48W where it also said 5W with the original controller. Since the power output is the same we think these are also just readback problems due to not following T1900456 . We opened the shutter turned on the amplifiers after a few minutes and set the power watchdogs back on as well as the pump diode watchdog. The PMC and FSS locked without issue Daniel found that the squeezer laser frequency had to increase by 850MHz to get the squeezer TTFSS locked so we moved the NPRO temperature up on the FSS by about 0.3 K. After this the squeezer and ALS lasers locked easily and Oli relocked the IFO. The first attached photo is the NPRO screen on the beckhoff machine before the controller swap the second photo is after. While Oli was relocking we saw that there are still glitches both of the attached screenshots were taken while the IFO was in the engage ASC state. Seeing this and based on Camilla's observation that the locklosses started 80561 on the same day that we redistributed gains to increase range in the IMC servo board in 79998 we decided to revert the change which was intended to help us ride out earth quakes. Daniel points out that this makes some sense that it might help to ride out the earthquake if we limit the range available to the carm servo. We hope that this will help us to ride out the glitches better without loosing lock. Rick went back to the diode room and reset the watchdogs after the laser had been running for about 2 hours. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80566,sheila.dwyer@ligo.org

We measured the distance from the top of the ALS table to the optics TR-M2 and ALS-M18 as accurately as possible without altering the alignment so the measurements may not be very precise and could be off by a few millimeters. Additionally we measured from the inside top of the ALS table not the outside.

These blades were paired after deflection measurements at LLO. The results can be found in the HDS BLADE DEFLECTION MEASUREMENTS spreadsheet. We have received the necessary parts and hardware to proceed with the HDS dither mirror assembly (bottom mass). Over the next couple of weeks we will focus on these assemblies. Rest assured we will continue to make progress. A detailed description of the assembly process is available in the O5 HXDS Clean Assembly Notes T2300438 . The status of the fabrication QA and C&B status can be found at C2200203: HDS fabrication for O5 . More pictures can be found at O5 HXDS pictures .

Oberling After the NPRO control box was swapped last week and glitches persisted (see alog80566 ) we decided it would be best to switch back to the original so that signal readbacks for the NPRO would be accurate. I started by bringing down the PSL in a controlled manner (ISS FSS PMC AMPs NPRO) then went out to the LVEA PSL racks and swapped control box S/N S2200008 for S2200009. Since this is the control box that had previously been in service with this NPRO laser head no adjustments were needed to set the temperature and current to be correct. I returned to the control room and brought the whole system back up without issue. Once it was time to lock the FSS similar to what was needed with the last control box swap I manually moved the NPRO temperature down about 0.4K (from 0.19 to -0.23) and locked the RefCav so that the SQZ laser would be happy. I then updated the FSS search parameters and accepted them in SDF (see screenshot ). As I noted in the 10-day trends yesterday (see alog80665 ) PMC REFL has risen over the past week so I attempted a remote alignment tweak using the picomotors before the PMC. In the end I wasn't able to make much of any improvement to the PMC alignment. I also attempted a remote alignment tweak for the RefCav and here I was able to get a slight improvement from 0.80V to 0.81V on the TPD. Looking for more things to try to impact the laser glitching and hopefully bring down the amount of PMC reflected power Jason and I returned to the PSL racks to try adjusting the NPRO pump current. We ultimately raised the current from 2.12A to 2.19A increasing the NPRO output power from 1.82W to 1.91W according to the PD in front of the laser but not having much of an impact on the PMC. We also tried slightly altering pump diode currents in the amplifiers but we didn't see any improvement so these remain as they were. I concluded our PSL activities today with a rotation stage calibration following the steps in alog79596 . The measurement file new calibration fit and screenshot of accepting SDFs are attached.

DAQ restart was required the addition of 51 slow channels. WP12132 New Dolphin adapter card Firmware. Keith Jonathan Erik EJ Tony Dave: Downgraded firmware was loaded onto the Dolphin IX-611 adapter cards in h1sush7 h1cdsh8 and h1oaf0. This is to prevent sponteneous PCI level switching which is possibly the cause of some O4 cornerstation Dolphin glitches. Procedure was: safe the systems running on the frontend fence the frontend from the Dolphin fabric stop all the models run the script to load the new firmware power down the frontend then pull the two power cords out for about a minute plug the power cords in power up let it boot and start the models. WP12134 DAQ Restart Script Restart rts-nds.service Jonathan Erik Dave: To prevent /run/nds/jobs filling the scripts to restart the DAQ was modified to restart the rts-nds.service on the nds machines as well as restarting their rts-daqd.services. This allows systemd to empty the /run/nds/jobs directory which was over 50% full on h1daqnds1. We tested this as part of this morning's DAQ restart it worked well. WP12087 Add VACSTAT gauge PVs to DAQ Dave: My first attempt to add the VACSTAT PVs relating to vacuum gauge monitoring failed because the channel names exceeded the DAQ length limit of 54 characters. I modified the VACSTAT code to drop the _PRESS_TORR from the PT channels names which allowed these channels to be added to the DAQ. A new H1EPICS_VACSTAT.ini file was created which added 368 channels to the EDC. DAQ and EDC restart was needed. The new VACSTAT IOC was restarted and the new MEDMs installed into production. WP12143 Replace failed SDD in h1guardian1 Dave Jonathan Erik: cds_report reported a failed disk in h1guardian1's md3 raid at noon today. Jonathan and Erik found a failed 230GB SDD which is part of the root file system on h1guardian1. It was replaced with a 1TB SSD (the smallest we have) resyning the new disk only took about an hour. DAQ Restart Jonathan Erik Dave: We restarted the DAQ for the addition of h1tcscs slow channels and the new VACSTAT EDC channels. EDC was restarted its channel count increased from 57061 to 57429. This was the first test of the new restart script which after doing the round of rts-daqd restarts then restarts rts-nds on the nds machines. The only problem was a spontaneous retstart of framewriter 1 after it had written about 3 full frames.

I couldn't resist and it didn't take that long. I attach the unit-full transfer functions between the ISI Sus. Point Drive DOFs (L P Y and T) and the Top Mass SUS M1 OSEMs response in L P Y.It's.... a complicated collection of TFs and this isn't all of them that are relevant!Just to make the point that Dan DeBra taught Brian Lantz who taught me and we're passing down to Edgard Bonilla: *every* DOF matters the one you ignore is the one that will bite you.The transverse T DOF drive data set demonstrates this point. None of these transverse to LPY couplings nominally exist if we just consider first principles equations of rigid-body motion of an ideal suspension. But alas the on-resonance coupling from T to L P Y ranges from 0.1 ... to 50 [m/m] or [rad/m]. I may need to drive the ISI with an entirely different color of excitation to resolve these transfer functions above 5 Hz where it's perhaps most interesting for DARM but this is a good start.The ISI drive templates have been re-committed to the repo with the calibrations of each channel in place. (It was really easy: just multiplying each channel by the appropriate 1e-9 [m/nm] or 1e-6 [m/um] in translation and similar 1e-9 [rad/nrad] or 1e-6 [rad/urad].) ,"{'term': 'H1 SEI', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80688,jeffrey.kissel@ligo.org

KisselWP 12140 I've completed 6 SUS + 4 ISI = 10 of 12 total DOF excitations that I wanted to drive before I ran out of time this morning. Each drive was ""successful"" in that I was able to get plenty of coherence between the 4 DOFs of ISI drive and SUS response and some coherence between 6 SUS drive DOFs and ISI response. As expected the bulk of the time was spent tuning the ISI excitations. I might have time to ""finish"" the data set and get the last two missing DOFs but I was at least able to get both directions of LPY to LPY transfer functions which are definitely juicy enough to get the analysis team started.Measurement environmental/configuration differences of the HAM2 ISI from how they are nominally in observing: - PR3 M1 DAMP local damping loop gains are at -0.2 where they are nominally at -1.0. (The point of the test.) - CPS DIFF is OFF. (needed to do so for maintenance day) - Coil Driver z:p = 1:10 Hz analog low-pass (and digital compensation for it) is OFF. (need to do so to get good SNR on SUS M1 drive without saturating the SUS DACs)Interesting things to call out that are the same as observing: - The PR3 alignment sliders were ON. P = -122 [urad] Y = 100 [urad]. (Don't *expect* dynamics to change with ON vs. OFF but we have seen diagonal response change if close an EQ stop. Haven't ever looked but I wouldn't be surprised of off-diagonal responses change. Also DAC range gets consumed by DC alignment request which is important for driving transfer functions.) - Corner station sensor correction informed by the Bier Garten ""ITMY"" T240 on the ground. (the h1oaf0 computer got booted this morning so we had to re-request the SEI_CS configuration guardian to be in WINDY. The SEI_ENV guardian had been set to LIGHT_MAINTENANCE.) - PR3 is NOT under any type of ISC global control neither L P or Y. (global ISC feedback for the PRC's LPY DOFs goes to PRM and PR2.) There are too many interesting transfer functions to attach or even to export in the limited amount of time I have.

The downside of this is that the wiring of its data cable is not compatible with the current CDS setup and therefore on the MEDM screen the AIP still appears as faulty - see picture attached. The controller will be replaced shortly after the Varian controller is fixed. Until then the Agilent controller will be periodically checked.Nevertheless the Noble-diode pump proved to be an excellent choice again as it pumped the Annulus volume down pretty quickly (in about 7 minutes) below 1E-6 Torr. ,"{'term': 'LHO VE', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80686,janos.csizmazia@ligo.org

Checked the beam centering on irises (used PWM for iris before power control) and used new Thorlabs VCR6S detector cards which were great!

Also since the NPRO controller was swapped 5 days ago but the potentiometers on the daughter board were not adjusted on the one swapped in ( alog80566 ) some of the readbacks for the NPRO channels are reporting inaccurate values namely the laser diode powers. The controller is planned to be swapped back to the original tomorrow so these readbacks will be fixed. Other item of note is that every time the PMC was unlocked last week it seems to have relocked with a slightly higher reflected power and corresponding lower transmitted power (see stabilization trends ). Looking at the PMC REFL camera image there could be something to gain from an alignment tweak into the PMC so I'll try that tomorrow during maintenance and see if there's any improvement. ,"{'term': 'H1 PSL', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80665,ryan.short@ligo.org

These changes have been highly successful at increasing the range particularly the most recent couple of OPO changes. However this type of rapid improvement in the spectrum can create challenges when measuring the spectrum of the data in downstream data analysis pipelines (similar to how the sudden turn-on of the line subtraction was problematic). When the OPO adjustment has created significant changes to the spectrum the time periods during the transition should be CAT1 vetoed (tagging Detchar-request). As an example of these transitions I've included a range timeseries and a daily spectrogram with the transition time indicated. I also have included a before/after spectrum comparison showing the broadband improvement at high frequency. To mitigate the impact on data analysis pipelines future transitions should either be made while briefly out of observing or tracked by Detchar for CAT1 vetoes.

The 35.4 Hz peak was found to couple strongly at HAM1 and HAM6 (see alog 79546 ). Shut-offs of the office area air handler and the main chillers showed that the peak decreases when these systems are shut off though it doesn't disappear completely. See Figure 1 and Figure 2 with office area air handler shut offs at 19:33:00-19:38:30 and 19:43:00-19:55:00 (alog 79888 ) and Figure 3 for main chiller shut offs (alog 73941 ). Note that there is also a fainter peak about 0.2 Hz above the 35.4 Hz peak as seen in Figure 4 but it is unclear if it also decreases when the HVAC is shut off. The oscillating 30-40 Hz peak tends to be near 40 Hz at the beginning and end of the UTC day and drops to near 30 Hz in the middle of the day as seen in Figure 5 . It often appears sinusoidal as seen in Figure 6 but sometimes has a more random appearance as in Figure 7 . It is seen in microphones and magnetometers as well and first appeared at least as early as 6 June 2024. Its source has yet to be identified. These peaks were dicussed in a presentation at the end of our summer fellowship as well as in a DetChar call now posted on the DCC: LIGO-G2402140 .

11379,H1 ISC - Comment to NB injections taken,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=80603,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 10 Oct 2024 17:22:04 -0700","I ran an updated noise budget using these new measurements plus whatever previous measurements were taken by Camilla in this alog . Reminder: the whole noise budget is now being run using median averaging. I used a sqz time from last night where the range was around 165 Mpc starting at GPS 1412603869. Camilla and Sheila took a no-sqz data set today starting at 1412607778. Both data sets are 600 seconds long. I created a new entry in gps_reference_times.yml called ""LHO_O4b_Oct"" with these times. To run the budget: >conda activate aligoNB >python /ligo/gitcommon/NoiseBudget/aligoNB/production_code/H1/lho_darm_noisebudget.py all plots found in /ligo/gitcommon/NoiseBudget/aligoNB/out/H1/lho_darm_noisebudget/ I made one significant edit to the code which is that I decided to separate the laser and input jitter traces on the main DARM noise budget. That means that the laser trace is now only a sum of frequency noise and intensity noise. Input beam jitter is now a trace that combines the pitch and yaw measurements from the IMC WFS. Now due to my changes in the jitter injections detailed above these jitter injections extend above 900 Hz. To reiterate: the injections are still only band-limited around 2 kHz which means that there could be unmeasured jitter noise above 2 kHz that was not captured by this measurement. One reason I wanted to separate these traces is partly because it appears there has been a significant change in the frequency noise. Compared to the last frequency noise measurement the frequency noise above 1 kHz has dropped by a factor of 10. The last time a frequency noise injection was taken was on July 11 right before the OFI vent alog 79037 . After the OFI vent Camilla noticed that the noise floor around 10 kHz appeared to have reduced as well as the HOM peak heights alog 76794 . She posted a follow-up comment on that log today noting that the IFO to OMC mode matching could have an effect on those peaks. This could possibly be related to the decrease in frequency noise. Meanwhile the frequency noise below 100 Hz seems to be about the same as the July measurement. One significant feature in the high frequency portion of the spectrum is a large peak just above 5 kHz. I have a vague memory that this is approximately where a first order mode peak should be but I am not sure. There is no significant change in the intensity noise from July except that there is also a large peak in the intensity noise just above 5 kHz. Gabriele and I talked about this briefly we think this might be gain peaking in the ISS but its hard to tell from alog measurements if that's possible. We think that peak is unlikely to be from the CARM loop. We mentioned the ISS theory to Ryan S. on the off-chance it is related to the current PSL struggles. The other significant change in the noise budget is the change in the LSC noise. The LSC noise has reduced relative to the last noise budget measurement alog 80215 which was expected from the PRCL feedforward implementation. Looking directly at the LSC subbudget PRCL has been reduced by a factor of 10 just as predicted from the FF performance . Now the overall LSC noise contribution is dominated by noise from MICH. Between 10-20 Hz we might be able to win a little more with a better MICH feedforward however that is a very difficult region to fit because of various high Q features ( reminder alog ). Just as in the previous noise budget there is a large amount of unaccounted-for noise. The noise budget code uses a quantum model that Sheila and Vicky have been working on extensively but I am not sure of the status and how much of that noise could be affected by adjustments to the model. Many of the noisy low frequency peaks also appear very broad on the timescale of the noise budget plot. We could try running over a longer period of time to better resolve those peaks. Between 100-500 Hz there are regions where the sum of known noises is actually larger than the measured noise. I think this is because the input jitter projections are made using CAL DELTA L but the overall noise budget is run on CALIB CLEAN where we are running a jitter subtraction.

Short F. Clara S. Dwyer In the ongoing effort to diagnose the source of the glitches seen in the PSL we decided to try moving the NeoLase control box in the PSL racks back to rack power essentially undoing what was done in alog79593 and observe any changes in the glitch behavior. While H1 was unlocked during the commissioning window this morning I shut down the PSL in a controlled manner (in order of ISS FSS PMC AMP2 AMP1 NPRO) then Fil switched CB1 back to rack power and I brought the system back up. When back in the control room we very quickly noticed glitching in the NPRO output power channel as we've seen before and after locking the RefCav the FSS glitches also returned. Deciding this wasn't the solution we were looking for (and concluding it probably wouldn't have changed anything in the first place) I took the PSL down again for Fil to switch back to the bench-top power supply then brough it back up all without issue. Fil also took the opportunity to install a longer cable for this power supply to reduce the trip hazard potential next to the PSL racks. This closes WP 12133 . I'm tagging DetChar since this separate power supply was noted to have helped reduce a 9.5Hz comb seen in DARM but I'll reiterate that functionally nothing here has changed and CB1 remains on its own power supply.

All injections were run with CARM on one sensor (REFL B). The cable for the frequency injection is still plugged in as of this alog but I reset the gains and switches so we are back on two CARM sensors and the injection switch is set to OFF. All injections are saved in the usual /ligo/gitcommon/NoiseBudget/aligoNB/aligoNB/H1/couplings folder under Frequency_excitation.xml IMC_PZT_[P/Y]_inj.xml and PRCL_excitation.xml . I realized an intensity noise injection might be interesting but when I went to run the template for the ISS excitation I was unable to see an excitation. I think there's a cable that must be plugged in to do this? I am not sure. *********Edit************ Ryan S. sent me a message with this alog that has notes about how intensity noise injections should be taken. Through this conversation I realized that I had misread the instructions in the template. I toggled an excitation switch on the ISS second loop screen when I should have instead set the excitation gain to 1. I was allowed another chance to run the intensity injections and I was able to do so using the low middle and high frequency injection templates in the couplings folder. Also the Input jitter injections have in the past been limited to 900 Hz because the IMC WFS channels are DQed at 2048 Hz. However the live IMC channels are at 16 kHz so I edited the IMC injection templates to run up to 7 kHz and use the live channels instead of the DQ channels. That allowed the measurements to run above 900 Hz. However the current injections are band-limited to only 1 or 2 kHz. I think we can widen the injection band to measure jitter up to 7 kHz. I was unable to make those changes because we had to go back to observing so this is future to-do item. I also updated the noise budget code to read in the live traces instead of the DQ traces. Unfortunately in my rush to run these injections I forgot to transition over to one CARM sensor so both the intensity and jitter measurements that are saved are with CARM on REFL A and B.,"{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",80596,elenna.capote@ligo.org

At one point we checked the voltage output from the driver and coudln't get it to change from 14V so in the interest of speed we just grabbed the spare hooked up power outside the rack (but not the high voltage or beckhoff slow controls connection) confirmed that output expected voltages and used that for testing.Turns out we had forgotten a safety feature of the Beckhoff slow controls for the high voltage driver was to maintain the fast shutter in a closed (up) state if the high voltage is not ready as a safety precaution to protect the down stream photodiodes. Since we had turned off the high voltage on Friday to do testing the Beckhoff system was forcing the chassis to constantly put out 14 volts and because the bobbin in the spare fast shutter was installed backwards was constantly forcing it down when we did the initial connection with the original high voltage driver.Testing today in the EE shop has confirmed normal functioning of the original high voltage driver chassis and it was just a mistake on our part along with the reversed polarity of the fast shutter which confused us initially. So despite suspicion early in the week there was no failure of the original driver just the fast shutter wiring.We are discussing how to setup a safe measurement of the high voltage drive to confirm the output signal matches expectation and nothing funny happened with the spare driver chassis when we had the spare fast shutter catastrophic failure.,"{'term': 'L1 General', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73577,joseph.betzwieser@ligo.org

The failure was that the 'tombstone' section of the fast shutter broke off from the rest of the peek part it is glued on the upstroke of the shutter. We are currently waiting on a spare Bobbin to come from LHO (from 3rd IFO) to try to repair one of the units we have. We do not believe we can repair either of the units we have right now. Below is a quick summary of where we are at: Original Fast Shutter S/N 005 * Issues with measuring open loop where we should of measured 20 ohm resistance for the coils * During debugging to try to find the issue two pins on the in-vacuum cable (at the flange) became dislodged. We didn't really touch them that vigorously so suspect that they were getting closer to being at a failure point and us touching it just was the final ""straw that broke the camels back"" of failure * Swapping to a new in-vacuum cable did not allow the original fast shutter to be operational. Our current suspicion(but still to be proven) is that it might be due to a kinked wire (the black tube Anamaria is holding in the picture is what the wire normally goes inside of and the kink is at the top of this tube) Spare Fast Shutter S/N 002 *New shutter Installed. Had to be installed 180 degrees in rotation to the original rotation as Bobbin installed backwards and so HR side of fast shutter mirror was facing the ing the wrong way. Also when we cabled it up as per the original fast shutter the polarity was backwards. * Connected up fast shutter so that the polarity was correct and fast shutter HR mirror was facing the correct way. Using the paddle controller to control the fast shutter we were successfully able to command the fast shutter to go slow up and slow down as per our commands (and the correct direction). * We installed the fast shutter in position (we had marked the position of the old shutter). We had to shim underneath the length of the fast shutter to alter the pitch of the beam from the fast shutter into the beam dump as the beam was ~1inch too low. * Clamping of the wires to not touch be caught get in the way of beams was where we spent the most time yesterday * Once we were happy we tested the fast shutter first with 'slow up' and 'slow down' commands and it worked fine. we then tested it ~ 5 times at its operational speed ('fast up'). End of Day 1 *This morning we finished cable dressing the cable from the ISI to stage zero and then unlocked the ISI to test the fast shutter one final time (in its ""fast up"" state) to see if we saw the usual ""kick"" in the sensors on the ISI we typically see when the fast shutter fires and also to take a slow motion video (with a phone) to see the operation. It was on this final test of the fast shutter that the tombstone part of the fast shutter broke away from the rest of the peek part it is glued to and landed on the table. *Note: Adam and I were the ones chamber side when this final shutter actuation took place.

I have the ISP-1000 and its respective logic fully operational. The ISP-1000 is using the same push buttons on the Turbo panel as the old screw pumps and has the same inlet valve logic as the HEPTAs. The automatic set point via a labjack T4 has been installed but the relay driver tick on pins FIO5 FIO4 GND and VS is not operating as expected. The Labjack is reading the voltages from both gauges and converting to pressure. It then updates the setpoint only if pressure is dropping. However if the pressure rises above the setpoint the Labjack reports that the setpoint is tripped but it fails to write FIO5 low to trip the safety valve. I am using the same Labjack and program that I had previously tested successfully in the VPW last week. We also think that the tick might be directionally dependent for how voltage is applied to the tick relay contacts RA RB and GND. Further testing is required. If this cant be resolved the dual range gauge is still wired in series with the labjack and it can be used to set a static setpoint just like we had before.

She is opening the top of the soft cover. 1322 In-chamber PC: 30/20/10 1323 Anamaria is going to index the fast shutter location with Adam M. 1328 Index complete. Joe B and Michael have moved the (newly replaced on Friday Oct 11) fast shutter driver chassis from beside the chamber to inside of the rack. 1330 De-cabling and removing the fast shutter. Leaving the spacer. Anamaria is bringing the new fast shutter into the chamber. CLASS A Spare Fast Shutter D1003318-2 https://ics.ligo-la.caltech.edu/JIRA/browse/ASSY-D1003318-2 1337 They’ve cabled up the new shutter Michael L is garbing to check the cabling. Putting the dog clamps back on for now. Will have to tighten up after re-alignment. Lockers are still on the shutter. 1340 Joe B is checking at the in-air cable at the chassis connector. Looks healthy. He plugged it into the chassis. 1342 Joe B turned on the chassis and Anamaria heard the clunk as expected. Slow up is working. Checked twice. It went down when he removed his finger from the paddle for slow up. Michael L is checking Anamaria’s connections. 1346 UP is closed. Joe B hooked up Beckhoff but the high voltage is not on so he can’t use Beckhoff to open it but the readout looked OK. So he unhooked Beckhoff. Michael L has verified that Anamaria’s connections are OK. 1353 Taking photos of WFS A. We need to go laser hazard for the rest of the tests. 1410 We are laser Hazard. Joe B is isolating LVEA ISIs except for HAM6 because its locked. 1413 Trying to lock IMC. Trying single bounce. SRM Is 2000 counts off due to Anamaria’s intentional misalignment. PRM is off 2000 counts again due to Anamaria’s intentional misalignment. 1423 Aligning all suspensions they were in a safe state. 1427 All SUS are untripped all ISIs are untripped and Anamaria sees flashes. 1430 Anamaria feels that it is aligned enough to close the shutter. Joe B hooked up Beckhoff and the shutter closed. The alignment is a bit low. Opening the shutter. Opened. Adam M and Anamaria are checking the alignment. About 3mm. 1436 Adam asked Joe B to close the shutter. Huyen is checking the locked ISI position to see if that’s a factor. Huyen reports that the ISI is only about 7 microns down in that corner. So Anamaria and Adam M agree to remove the spacer underneath. There is a chance that the old shutter was at a different vertical spacing than this one. 1443 Removed the spacer under the fast shutter. Checking now. It looks perfectly centered. The new shutter points down a bit so it hits the beam dump lower. They are adjusting the beam dump. 1448 Aligning the fast shutter. It’s pitched. 23” x 12” working out the angle that it is off in pitch. D1201293-v2 wedged blocks may work. They are made to different angles. 1457 Considering a 3 deg wedge and that’s too much. Matt is getting some Class A alum strips which could run the length of the fast shutter bottom plate. 1510 Trying Alum strip. 1515 Strip seems to work give good angle. Checking with the beam – making sure that the wire is not clipping the beam. Looks good. 1522 Moving folks away from the chamber as Joe B turns on the high voltage. He’s engaged the high voltage. Checking functionality. Down and up. Checking a few times. Turning the high voltage power supply off. 1541 Taking a video of the beam of the fast shutter with the shutter down/open. They’ll take the video again with the shutter up/closed. Putting Beckhoff back on so Josh does not need to hold the button on the paddle. Huyen has a complicated video camera and is providing instructions. 1554 Final configuration needed for wires. Clamping them down. Adam M and Michael L working on this cable dressing. 1600 List of activities remaining - check for fast shutter repeatability pointing & hysteresis check beams on WFSs unlock ISI. Decided to input an after-hours work permit to complete this today. We have an operator in the chair until 7pm. 1622 Joe B is slowly opening the fast shutter. Now putting it back up. Checking beam pointing. Putting it down. Checking it going up and down. Looks good – Anamaria wants to loosen one of the cable clamps. It may sit a bit more flush/further back which is good. 1629 Modifying the cable clamp now. Making a new one. 1653 Still getting the cable dressing just right. It’s better. Checking the up and down slowly. Joe B is using the paddle to cycle through ups and downs. Cable dressing discussion. More discussion. 1712 More cycling of the shutter. One wire is slightly touching but touching something soft. They’re taking photos. 1717 Taking a video of fast shutter opening and closing slowly with paddle. Setting up Beckhoff for fast shutter opening and closing fast. Joe B is going to turn on high voltage. They have their reference. Joe B has turned on high voltage and reading back 150 V. Triggering fast shutter with Beckhoff. A wire moved (bad). Turning off high voltage. Disconnecting the high voltage cable from the chassis. May have bent the wire. They need to remove the slight twist in that one wire. 1728 They removed the clamps and are now trying to untwist the wire so it’s straight. 1748 Anamaria showed what the wiring issue is with the viton tubing photo. She found a kink in the wire of the old fast shutter. Could be the problem. 1805 Re-dressing the cables. Testing the fast shutter with the paddle. The wire is not touching. Joe B is hooking up the high voltage to perform the fast test. It is now turned on. Capacitors are charging. Fully charged to 230 V. Testing fast opening and closing. 1814 Taking a video of the shutter closing and opening. Going to laser safe. Turning off high voltage. It’s off. We are laser safe. We have removed the D2100541-v1 -001 Fast Shutter Spacer https://dcc.ligo.org/DocDB/0177/D2100541/001/D2100541-v1.PDF which is about 0.175 lb. 1825 Looking at WFS diodes for damage with the dino light.

It was bent to clear that. 0959 Michael L taking continuity measurements. Direct resistance of the fast shutter coil. 1000 Across the peek screw terminal – across the coil open. Trying again – still recording open. Now he’s measuring directly to the pins – still open. Screw terminal connecting two wires vertically – should see 20 ohms but it is open. He put the probes on the screws and the end of the barrel for the measurement. We will need to replace the fast shutter itself. They measured vertically across and horizontally across. Reference https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/uploads/73522_20241010123110_IMG_2038.jpg 1003 Taking a photo down at the bobbin. 1005 Michael L says that the screws seem tight. Josh suggested measuring across the in-series terminal block. He sees open. 1007 Anamaria is climbing up to take a look. She can manually move the shutter. 1012 They are going to try removing the screws that are holding the pins in on the bobbin side. 1012 Turning the illuminator off as it’s shining in their eyes. 1013 Anamaris is holding one probe Michael L is holding the other probe. End to end on the bobbin. It’s open. Still open when Anamaria is moving along the pin with the probe – still open. With one particular position of the probes it reads 20 – 22 ohms. 1016 Randomly the north crane is working. 1017 Between pin a and c should be a short. 1019 Seems like its coming back and forth – they’re measuring the coil again. Fluctuating between 20 ohm and 100 and open. We see 20 ohms through the coil itself but not at the terminal block. But they didn’t see that in the beginning. Manipulating the pins a bit now shows 20 ohms. 1024 Josh is going to get the probe clips with the toothed jaws. Going to install the pins again into the terminal block. It now measures 20 ohms. They screwed the cable at the outside of the chamber flange back in and are going to check it at the chassis. A and B should be 20 ohms. https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/uploads/73522_20241010123110_IMG_2038.jpg 1028 A and B at the chassis is 20 ohms A to C is 20 ohms B to D is 1.4 ohms A and C is 1.2 ohms. 1029 They are switching out the probes to ones with toothed jaw to remeasure in-chamber. All they did was reseat the pins. But that doesn’t explain the B to D short. 1031 They screwed in everything. Anamaria is agitating the inner connector at the flange it went open. Then it went back to 22 ohms. Fluctuating short to 22 ohms when she’s manipulating the connector. Pointing towards feedthrough or cable. We have not had it steady open which is what she’s trying to induce. She can’t get it to stay open. So she’s checking B and D now. It’s reading 1-2 ohms. She’s moving the cable. Steady open then back to 1. Flickering now…still. She’s pressing it back and it’s at 2ohms but it’s flickering between 1 to 5 ohms. Flickering between 1 and open. 1038 Taking the whole connector out of the feedthrough flange to do a continuity check at the connector. Two wires came loose from two cable connector pins. Speculation that the connector at the flange got loose. They’ve measured the in-air cable many times but they’ll try it again. They’ll have to swap the in-chamber cable. They’ll test the fast shutter by itself. 1059 They are removing the in-chamber cable from the cable clamps traveling up the HAM ISI. 1100 Anamaria is removing the cable at the PEEK. She needs to add black glass back into the holder. 1103 They are putting the new cable in chamber. There is no serial number on the cable. They are considering moving the terminal block so the wire won’t have to turn so sharply. They are not going to change the position of the terminal block but are going to reconfigure the pins to try to avoid bending the pin/wire connection on the cable. 1111 For reference https://dcc.ligo.org/DocDB/0114/D1400225/001/FastShutterAirVacWiringChain_v1.pdf 1115 They’ll wait to dress the new cable after testing. 1121 They’re testing pin 2 to 4 which is supposed to be short and it’s showing 0.7. One connection is still fluctuating but now shows 20ohms. Michael L is double checking the B and D as open Rechecking the coil by moving the probe up and down the crimp pins. Looks good. 1126 Anamaria is connecting the new cable to the feedthrough. 1127 They are using the new driver with the paddle (test board). Connecting up the cable to the driver. Turning on the driver. She heard something not sure what. Michael L says that he didn’t see the shutter move but perhaps the shutter moved when the driver was powered up. He remembers that from Friday. Testing slow up. Testing slow down. Nothing happened to the shutter for each. Power cycling the driver. Pressing slow up – light goes on. Nothing happened. Turning the driver off again. They’re going to do a whole continuity measurement. 1131 Josh and Huyen are checking at the cable. A and B is open which should be 20. B to C is 1-2 ohms but then it was jumping around. Anamaria will screw in the connector at the feedthrough better. She’s waiting for a longer L-key. 1144 Josh is checking the driver itself. A and B is measuring 14 volts. It looks good. 1135 Anamaria has completed reseating the connector. 1136 Back to rechecking the cable. Open connections. Some cursing. Re-jostling. Seeing fluctuations. Open. More cursing. 1139 Wires are not marked so it doesn’t look like there is laser damage. 1143 Taking lots of photos including of the WFSs and REFL PD.

I spent time working on it all of this week and finally tried a setting I found in a Matrikon video about setting up the tunneller. I still don't know why this setting worked but it seems to have solved the initial connection problems. So as long as the OPC server is running which usually starts when the tunneller is started the client connects within a few moments. If the OPC server is not running it should start up after the client is started but it takes time for the server to load its configuration about half a minute. So the client will likely need to be killed and restarted after the OPC server has finished for the client to connect correctly. The way to tell if a restart is necessary is the FMCS data points will all be zero if the client tried to start before the OPC server was finished.The setting I changed in the Matrikon tunneller is in the Classic (COM) Details for the Siemens OPC Server. The setting is the sixth line down and is called Separator Chars and is blank by default. I added a period (.) as a separator character because the server uses a period for each level in the structure to represent a data point. For exampleManagementView.FieldNetworks.LIVINGSTONOBSERVATORY.WESTENDSTATION.Points.AA02AT.ValueIn the above example every period is a step in the tree that takes you to the proper data point location.The separator chars setting is supposed to speed up browsing so I guessed that this might help since timeouts were listed in the logs over and over again. I'm still not sure why this helped or even if it actually helped but since changing this setting the opcua client connects without any problems and with no delays.I also took the time to figure out how to add the missing OPC channel to the Siemens OPC server. In Desigo I added a virtual channel for the PSL room temperature and modified the script that forwards the virtual channels to the OPC server to include the channel I created. So all of the channels from the old OPC server are available in the new OPC server and I was able to receive data for the entire channel list with my test setup.I guess we still need to decide on a startup procedure not sure if Desigo starts automatically but at this time the Matrikon tunneller and the FMCS opcua client need to be started manually.One final concern I have the client running with no security enabled. I have been reading on how to generate security certificates with openssl and Mike T. gave me some pointers but I have not tried to do this yet. I'm not sure if we need to run with security since this is on an internal network but if so this will still need to be worked on before the client is ready.So the client without security is ready but the client with security will need more work.CDS FMCS,"{'term': 'LLO FMCS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73546,marc.lormand@ligo.org

Joe armed the fast shutter and set the threshold low enough that it would trigger automatically. We were unable to see to see any movement on the GS-13 from the fast shutter trigger. Laxen then hooked up a Fast Shutter Test Board to the test input of the Fast Shutter Driver and attempted to manually drive the shutter. This failed to have any effect. Laxen turned off the high voltage to the supply and we attempted to measure the continuity of the cable. CABLE PINS FLANGE PINS EXPECTED MEASURED A & C 1 & 3 1 to 2 Ω 1.5 Ω B & D 2 & 4 1 to 2 Ω OPEN A & B 1 & 2 20 Ω OPEN C & D 3 & 4 20 Ω OPEN E & F 5 & 6 1 to 2 Ω 2.0 Ω This indicated that there was a break in the cable downstream of the Fast Shutter Driver. We unplugged the cable from the flange and measured pin to pin. The in-air cable tested fine. Huyen then climbed between the chambers and repeated the measurements from the flange directly. The measurements were the same indicating the issue lays in the flange or beyond.,"{'term': 'LLO Electrical', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73524,josh.collins@ligo.org

In this case it incorrectly went to the SHUTTER_NO_TRIGGER state instead of the SHUTTER_FAIL state.Tonight around 3:14 UTC we had a lockloss where we had 3.8 volts peak which is above the threshold of 1.5 volts but did not see any action in the GS13 of HAM6. This suggests the fast shutter despite receiving a command to close and reporting that it was in fact closed via the Beckhoff readbacks did not actually kick the table which makes me wonder if it actually closed or closed at its typical speed. I do not see particularly large signals on the OMC DCPDs during the lockloss although our new AS port PD shows a typical amount of power due to a lockloss at the AS port (i.e. L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_11_OUT_DQ) so at the very least the PZT did its job even if the fast shutter didn't. For the moment I've corrected the LOCKLOSS_SHUTTER_CHECK guardian code to do the right comparison i.e. if we don't see a kick of 3e4 counts on the GS13 and the voltage of the trigger PD didn't go above 1.5 Volts then we should go to the SHUTTER_NO_TRIGGER state. In the case of no kick and voltage is higher than threshold (the case we had here) it will now correctly go to the SHUTTER_FAIL state.I've modified ISC_LOCK guardian to not return True in the down state if either we are in the SHUTTER_FAIL (which we will be going forward if this repeats) or the SHUTTER_NO_TRIGGER state keeping the ISC_LOCK guardian in the DOWN state. I'll want to revisit this in the morning or the next lockloss.So in summary DCPDs were protected. Unclear if fast shutter is working or if GS13 may have an issue. I've modified codes so the guardian should not proceed if we again do not see a kick associated with a lockloss irregardless of the threshold level at the moment and I've asked Karla to call me if we lose lock tonight.For reference the last time the LOCKLOSS_SHUTTER_CHECK guardian was in the SHUTTER_NO_TRIGGER state was May 9 2023 and looks like we were having Beckhoff slowcontrols issues and recovering from a power outage then so this looks to be the first real time this has been in this case and probably why I haven't noticed the logic error until now.,"{'term': 'L1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}",73506,joseph.betzwieser@ligo.org
