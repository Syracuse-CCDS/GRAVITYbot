This change mostly accounts for the path length change due to the thermo-refractive changes experienced by the test masses, i.e. wavefront distortion within the substrates. To correct for the quadratic mode-mismatch between the IFO beam and the squeezed beam, due to the thermo-elastic surface deformation effect, we will need to sweep the ZM4 and ZM5 PSAMS, i.e. the defocus on the squeezed beam. As important as the wavefront curvature, misalignment of a beam also imprints an effective tilt on the wavefront, compromising the mode-matching, i.e. the electric field overlap. So, to recover our optimal squeezing level of ~ -5.8 dB with the new TCS settings, we will need to perform fine alignment scans as well as the PSAM scans . For context: Fast alignment with the SQZ guardian was attempted and yielded no improvement for the 71 W case. We have seen the need for the fine alignment and PSAM scans in keeping the squeezing level up for various thermal states: the recovery of -5.7 dB squeezing with 63.5 W alogs 72160 72287 , the drop to 56 W alog 72249 , partial recovery work after going back up to 63.5 W alog 72441 . Shot noise comparison with comparable squeezing levels: Attached is a DARM plot showing representative strains for the three different power levels, with comparable squeezing level at ~ -5.4 dB. The black trace is taken with 71 W, the purple trace is with 63.5 W, and the green trace is with 56.7 W input power. The high frequency noise around 4-7 kHz is also comparable for the 63.5 W and 71 W cases. Low frequency noise looks about the same for all three power levels in this plot, with the improvement in shot noise with increasing power visible >300 Hz . These strains were chosen from times where we are not hindered by the low frequnecy nonstationary noise that shows up sporadically. The measurements are taken over a 10 minute period in each case.

85,85,L1 ISC - Brief summary of 71W power-up commissioning,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=72568,https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Fri, 09 Aug 2024 12:43:33 -0500","Valera, Adam, Begum, Karla, Vlad, JoeB, Anamaria For the past some 10 days we've been running at ~71W input power, above the nominal ~64W. I will try to summarize some of our activities and findings so far. In the first 3 plots I show the same top two panels and time span , and then different signals related to different observations (so they're more visible than if I were to plot 10 panels). The top plot is the input power over the past 20 days. We had to operate at even lower power (56W) for a bit because the CO2 alignment had been lost, so it's interesting to compare the 3 input power behaviors. The second plot is kappa_c, the indicator of optical gain; it should not change with power the way it is calculated. We always lose a bit of optical gain as we go up in power, but it's superficially still worth it if we lose less than we gain in shot noise level. In the first plot attached , the third signal is the POP power, calibrated in W in the PRC. Based on Valera's estimate of arm power , we think this corresponds to ~280kW/307kW/335kW circulating in the arm for the 3 power settings. The next signal is the 9 mHz buildup in the PRC, scaled by input power. It seems to go down no matter what. For reference, the current ~1700 value corresponds to a buildup of 70, while the perfect mode matching estimate is ~120. The 45 MHz buildup is much smaller by design, ~13 in a perfect world, and it does something similar to the 9MHz so I don't show it here. This 9 MHz buildup drop has us concerned about the stability of various loops, since it's the identical behavior that LHO saw during their highest power operations. We measured the PRCL loop as a good indicator of this, but it seems to so far not lose too much gain. Adam also measured the CARM loop yesterday, and it seemed a bit not ideal, he will post details separately, but more measurements are necessary and we will do them in the next commissioning period. In the second plot attache d, I show also range (after calibration) with optical gain and squeezer performance , since both affect range significantly. With every power adjustment and large TCS changes, the squeezer has to be readjusted, which Begum has been doing this entire period. During all these changes, albeit small in the grand scheme of things, the range seems slightly lower for the higher power, but that's to be expected for the optimization period. We've definitely found a better thermal state in the past few days and we hope to get some more data to have a more fair comparison with the nominal 64W operation. In the third plot attached , I show some of the TCS setting changes . At 56W we can afford to run without CO2, which is a good state to have automated in case of hardware issues. We then tried two different settings at 71W, ~2.0W and ~2.4W. We were hoping we can trade CO2 for ITM ring heater to increase the sideband buildup without losing optical gain (because they have different lensing versus curvature effect). So far we can't say we found this to be true or quantified it, but we will continue. With the higher CO2 setting we were indeed able to reduce the ITM RH power below the 64W settings to increase the optical gain. We have not tested much ETM ring heater effects yet, still to check. We are also trying to decipher if the Hartmann signals and the SIM signals could be useful for tuning, we will separately make a report on that. Vlad will post an optical mode shift report in various configurations, to see if we can use it for carrier mode matching improvement. Thermal transient: it does seem to be much longer as we increase the nominal low noise CO2 values. We are trying to understand it to see if we can speed it up. Right now we apply about half of it right after DC readout, and the rest after we've powered up, but there's no matching done with the central transient. This alone could be an argument for running at lower power, since we lose range in the first few hours of the lock, especially because of the squeezer transient that has elongated as well. The differential element also has a long trasient (not shown), long locks start with higher frequency coupling, which then goes down over a few hours and settles at a reasonable value. This can be seen directly in DARM at ~5-6kHz where the frequency noise is close: when that region has a bump, we have more coupling/contrast defect/differential lensing. Noise: We don't have a deep assessment yet of the noise comparison, there may be a bit of low frequency noise at the higher power, but that's confounded with squeezer operation. We will post a noise curve later. Aside from a ~20 Hz peak that sometimes appears, it looks about the same as 64W, except better shot noise. Stability: We have had several ~day long locks, most locklosses from low noise being due to earthquakes. However, the power up from 45W to final power has been slowed down and still exhibits instabilities which cause us to lose lock. This is a terrible place to lose lock, because it takes 30min to get to this point so it's a big duty cycle impact. This problem is not new, it's been happening all of O4b, it's just more now that we do more steps. A ~2.7 Hz oscillation appears and runs away, seemingly largest in DARM, which is confusing. We remeasured the cross-over of L1/L2 which has an instability near there, but it has 6dB of margin and it makes no sense it would be power dependent. However, we realized that during power up steps we turn off the SRM angular loop (SRC2), and as the power up step got longer and longer, maybe it's not ok to have the SRM not follow the alignment shifts in power up. The loop is slow so it would overcorrect for quick power steps, but since we've slowed them down over time, Adam added into guardian to turn this loop on in between the power steps (still have to assess the time constant it needs and optimize). After failing to power up 5 times in a row without it, with this modification it worked, but we'll wait for more statistics to see the true color of the herring.

Quadrants 1,2,4 have very little power on them; whilst almost all of the light falls on quadrant 3.

While the pressure in the Y-mid RGA manifold is lower than the Y-arm, a lot of the gas in the Y-arm is hydrogen and the RGA gas load is dominated by water. Switching up our approach, it appears the face of the sealing plate on the CF8"" gatevalve seperating the Y-mid RGA from the Y-arm is acting as a cold spot in the 200C RGA bakeout.

Pressures peaked and are returning to normal while the GV is hot. August 6th. 8:45 AM - Started wrapping the CF8"" GV with heat tape. Tested ramp up and the 4 ft heat tape was insufficent at even heating. Switched to 8 ft heat tape with the same current draw as the 4 ft to get more even temperatures.

Watched the rampup for about 20 minutes to verify there's no hot or cold spots. Pressure in the RGA manifold increased to 1.2E(-8) Torr. 1:50 PM - Checked pressure and heating again at the Y-mid RGA. Bumped the RGA manifold up to 200C and checking the gatevalve, its at 104C.

157,8,H1 PSL - PSL 9.5Hz Comb Hunt (LHO WP 12031),https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=79533,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 12:28:53 -0700","J. Oberling, F. Clara Summary : We think the 9.5Hz peak is coming from the new flow meters installed as part of the 2021 PSL laser upgrade. Today we continued hunting for the 9.5Hz comb triplet that Ansel had tracked to the PSL back in May . Robert subsequently used a temporary magnetometer and found a strong 9.5Hz feature in the neoLASE LVEA Control Box. To try to isolate the source of this 9.5Hz peak we shut down the PSL in a controlled manner and watched the peak on the magnetometer. The order of the shutdown: PSL Stabilization systems (PMC/ISS/FSS) Laser Chiller There was no change in the peak observed during the PSL shutdown, so we next turned off the neoLASE Control Box; the peak clearly disappeared with the Control Box off. Our next step was to check if the peak was being fed to the Control Box via something plugged into it. We turned the Control Box back on and the peak returned (as expected), then we unplugged the cable that feeds the flow/temperature sensor signals to the Control Box (via the PSL Sensor Interface Chassis (SIC), which feeds the Control Box with several monitor signals (PDs, power meters, flow meters) and the system shutters). Lo and behold, the peak was much smaller, sometimes disappearing entirely (see attached pictures; first is with the PSL off but the flow meters plugged in, second is with the flow meters unplugged). We next took the top off of the SIC and placed the magnetometer near where the flow meter signals both come into and exit the SIC, and did not see the peak. Fil then placed the magnetometer on the flow sensor connectors themselves (the flow sensor cables route to a pig tail on the back of the SIC, which goes from an individual M12 connector for each flow meter into a DB25 connector to plug into the SIC) and the 9.5Hz peak was clearly visible again. If we unplugged the main flow meter cable from the back of the Control Box the peak again disappeard; this makes sense as the Control Box supplies the 24 VDC the flow meters need, and unplugging the cable removes power from the flow meters. We then put the top back on the SIC and placed the magnetometer back in its spot directly underneath the Control Box and plugged the flow meters back in; the peak again returned. Fil disconnected the individual M12 connectors for the flow meters and the peak again disappeared. We then plugged each individual flow meter in to observe how the peak behaved (I did not take pictures of this, unfortunately). With 1 flow meter plugged in the peak was visible but much smaller; with 2 plugged in the peak was even smaller (???); with three plugged in the peak was back to its usual magnitude. With this odd behavior we suspect a grounding issue somewhere. To finish things off we unplugged the other items feeding signals into the Control Box (shutters, PDs/power meters, NPRO, Diode Box A, Diode Box B), one at a time, to observe how/if the peak changed; we observed no change in the peak during this process, the only thing that changed the peak with the Control Box turned on was unplugging the flow meter cable. We think this fairly definitively tags the flow meters as the source for the 9.5Hz peak seen in Robert's magnetometer, and likely the source of the comb triplet seen around this frequency. We are now looking through documentation to see how we can mitigate this. One option is to tie the grounds of all 3 flow meters together and see if this changes the peak; this requires running long cables from each flow meter to tie them all at the same spot. We also plan on using the spare Control Box to check into how the internal grounding of the Beckhoff terminal is done and see if there's any improvements we can make there. Another option is to isolate power to the flow meters; currently they are powered by the Control Box, but we could power them separtely and see if that changes the peak. Investigation continues, more to come. The PSL is now back ON, and the PMC and FSS RefCav are locked; I'm letting the system warm up for a bit before locking the ISS. This closes LHO WP 12031 . Edit to add: When unplugging the flow meters individually via their M12 connectors, we did try each of the 3 flow meters by themselves; the peak was the same regardless of which individual flow meter was plugged in. Things got weird when we had 2 plugged in at the same time (the peak was smaller than with any of the individual flow meters plugged in, hence why we suspect a grounding issue somewhere), and the peak returned to its starting magnitude when all 3 were plugged in at the same time.

We took a sweep, and realized the frequency dependent change looked to be around 4% at the worst points (see second attachment). We worried this was going to negatively effect the calibration significantly, and so were trying to apply a corrected compensation filter based on old measurements of the S1200470 (see LLO alog 58800 but apparently repairs on the readback side of things affected the transfer function of the coildriver itself significantly. The third attachment has what would have been corrected if we used the old S1200470 fit to correct the current compensation, which doesn't match up to the calibration PUM sweep.According to our many PCAL monitoring lines, the response looks within 2% up to 1 kHz. See for example here . Louis also took a broadband between 20 and 200 Hz, and compared it to the one taken on Saturday, and while there is a perceptible difference, it also seems on the order of 2%.I'll need to take several hours of measurements of the coil driver in situ for its various states to get the current response of the coil driver, and then update the digital compensation.

We worried this was going to negatively effect the calibration significantly, and so were trying to apply a corrected compensation filter based on old measurements of the S1200470 (see LLO alog <a href=""https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=58800"">58800</a> but apparently repairs on the readback side of things affected the transfer function of the coildriver itself significantly.  The third attachment has what would have been corrected if we used the old S1200470 fit to correct the current compensation, which doesn't match up to the calibration PUM sweep.

According to our many PCAL monitoring lines, the response looks within 2% up to 1 kHz.  See for example <a href=""https://gstlal.ligo.caltech.edu/grafana/d/StZk6BPVz/calibration-monitoring?orgId=1&amp;var-DashDatasource=llo_calibration_monitoring_v3&amp;var-coh_threshold=%22coh_threshold%22%20%3D%20%27cohok%27%20AND&amp;var-detector_state=%22hoft_ok%22%20%3D%20%27HOFT_OK%27%20AND%20%22obs_intent%22%20%3D%20%27OBS_INTENT%27%20AND&amp;from=1723588443552&amp;to=1723588885808"">here</a>. Louis also took a broadband between 20 and 200 Hz, and compared it to the one taken on Saturday, and while there is a perceptible difference, it also seems on the order of 2%.

I'll need to take several hours of measurements of the coil driver in situ for its various states to get the current response of the coil driver, and then update the digital compensation.  However, for now the calibration looks to be in an acceptable state, so it can wait until Tuesday if necessary.CAL, SUS		<!--- Output file_1_72645 div -->

kappaC (dimensionless) * Hc at calibration export (DARM_ERR cnt/m) * <code>L1:OMC-DCPD_SUM_OUT</code>/<code>L1:LSC-DARM_IN1</code> (mA/DARM_ERR cnts)

In summary, H1 data has nearly 7x more of these artifacts than L1, mostly due to the much higher proliferation of comb artifacts. H1 data also suffers from a large number of narrow artifacts in the ~100 Hz bands near test mass violin resonance harmonics, usually during times of rung up violin resonances. Without careful handling of the data in frequency bands near the violin modes, nearly 18% of the 10 Hz - 2 kHz band is contaminated, though more careful handling results in about 6% of the band being contaminated (roughly equivalent to L1). The L1 detector does not suffer from these same artifacts. Details: After compiling a list of vetted, non-astrophysical artifacts into the version 1 lines and combs list for O4a, we extracted some statistics for each detector in order to compare and contrast the data quality from this perspective, and to determine which of the artifacts are most problematic for long duration narrowband searches (CW or narrowband directed stochastic searches).New for this observing run, we have two new features for the lines list: 1) artifacts with known time variation (turn on/turn off) where we can establish reasonable metrics for their presence in the data we also provide a segment list for times those artifacts are present; 2) a new type 3 artifact that is not simply a narrow frequency band for a single artifact, but rather a band (typically 1 Hz or larger) with many narrow artifacts degrading the data quality within the band.

There was no light on AS_C initally, so Oli had to move SR2 about 200urads before there was light on the sensor. SR2 moved about 60urads to center on AS_C. With AS_C centered, H1:ASC-AS_C_SUM_OUTPUT was at 0.0078 vs the 0.0045 reported on July 17 reported in the linked alog above (73% increase). We ran into some P motion when we turned sensor correction on, but maybe this is expected while we have some HEPIs locked. The AS Air camera had the slightest bit of a spot on the top left corner of it when we were centered.</p>

<p><strong>Fast Shutter Test</strong></p>

<p>While centered on AS_C we opened the fast shutter. We immediately saw light on AS_A and AS_B (1600 and 2000 counts respectively). We closed the shutter and it went away. <a href=""https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/uploads/79575_20240816120409_AS_C_throughput_and_fastshutter_test.png"">1st attachment</a></p>

277,26,H1 DetChar - Comment to Issue with calibration line subtraction at beginning of locks,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=79558,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Thu, 15 Aug 2024 14:56:32 -0700","A while back, I investigated this and found that the reason for occasional early lock subtraction problems is that, at the end of the previous lock, the lines were turned off, but the TFs were still being calculated. Then, at the beginning of the next lock, it takes several minutes (due to the 512-s running median) to update the TFs with accurate values. There were two problems that contributed to this issue. I added some more gating in the pipeline to use the line amplitude channels to gate the TF calculation. This fix was included included in gstlal-calibration-1.5.3 , as well as the version currently in production (1.5.4). However, there have been some instances in which those channels were indicating that the lines were on when they were actually off at the end of the previous lock, which means this code change, by itself, does not fix the problem in all cases. The version that is currently in testing, gstlal-calibration-1.5.7 , includes some other fixes for line subtraction, which may or may not improve this problem. A more reliable way to solve this issue would be to ensure that the line amplitude channels we are using always carry accurate real-time information. Specifically, we would need to prevent the occurance of the lines turning off long before these channels indicate this has occurred.

This peak dates back to at least June 2023, possibly longer. We placed the portable accelerometer in seven different spots, each time against a wall except for one spot near BS1. See the attachment 1 for the reference map. The peak appears strongest at REF0 and REF5 as seen in attachment 2 . We attempted to test outside near the Mitsubishis (outside the OSB kitchen) and the southeast-facing mechanical room wall as well but had data retrieval issues, so we'll go back to that soon. We are also investigating the ~36 Hz peak seen in attachment 2, strongest near the X OL. It seems to have been around since at least 2023-05-08, but more investigation is needed to find out when it started and if it shows up consistently every day. The frequency of this peak oscillates on a range of about 1 Hz. Attachment 3 shows the peak in H1:PEM-CS_LVEAFLOOR_XCRYO_Z_DQ and H1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN. This peak also travels between 30-40 Hz, generally near 40 Hz at the beginning and end of the UTC day and dropping towards 30 Hz in the middle of the day, as seen in attachment 4 from the summary pages.

The peak appears strongest at REF0 and REF5 as seen in <a href=""https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/uploads/79546_20240814123436_portable_acc_spec.png"" target=""_blank"">attachment 2</a>. We attempted to test outside near the Mitsubishis (outside the OSB kitchen) and the southeast-facing mechanical room wall as well but had data retrieval issues, so we'll go back to that soon.</p>

<p>We are also investigating the ~36 Hz peak seen in attachment 2, strongest near the X OL. It seems to have been around since at least 2023-05-08, but more investigation is needed to find out when it started and if it shows up consistently every day. The frequency of this peak oscillates on a range of about 1 Hz. <a href=""https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/uploads/79546_20240814123455_xcryo_darm.png"" target=""_blank"">Attachment 3</a> shows the peak in H1:PEM-CS_LVEAFLOOR_XCRYO_Z_DQ and H1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN. This peak also travels between 30-40 Hz, generally near 40 Hz at the beginning and end of the UTC day and dropping towards 30 Hz in the middle of the day, as seen in <a href=""https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/uploads/79546_20240814123509_oscillating_peak_sum.png"" target=""_blank"">attachment 4</a> from the summary pages.</p>

So it looks like about 2 hours ago, around 2:09 UTC, the PCALY power went down, and then went highly variable.  I'm not sure if this AOM or insufficient laser power, although I tend to the think the later.  We will run on PCALX until we get the opportunity to address this, most likely Monday.

So we did the following emergency changes to make that PCALX change happen:

1) Flipped the l1calcs model reference from EY RX PD to EX RX PD
2) Shuttered the EY photon calibrator
3) Turned off all the excitations on the EY photon calibrator
4) Turned off the hardware injections
5) Turned off the monitoring lines on the EX photon calibrator
6) Moved the 16.9 Hz, 434.9 Hz and 1083.1 Hz the EX photon calibrator
7) Modified the ISC_LOCK guardian to turn those lines on only on EX
8) Modified the nominal and request states of the HIGH_FREQ_LINES guardian to IDLE
9) Modified IFO_CALIB guardian to not run in the IDLE state
10) Added a -1 to the gain in the EX RX PD readback.

We looked at the L1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN and L1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN_CLEAN to confirm they looked reasonable. Also spot checked the GDS kappa generation to make sure they had the correct sign.CAL		<!--- Output file_1_72724 div -->

One of the issues is that we are kind of blind to the cause of the issue at the moment. Not a lot is really trended in terms of the faults that can happen. Another issue is that the viewport IR sensor and laser temperature sensor share an alarm channel (for historical reasons, due to one being added at the last minute) . A third issue is that the faults arent latched so if the issue goes away before we can see it on the controller, we dont know the cause of the issue. Thus for this weekend the decision was made to run at lower input power (~56.5W) and run with no CO2 this weekend and try to set up some monitoring on some of the channels next week to see if it can help us track down what might be the issue. While trying to go to lower input power we lost lock, and so we took the opportunity to add some monitoring to the IR sensor. The box in question we are going to run some temporary monitoring to is D1300249-V3 (version 4 isnt actually in existence). We are adding a breakoff board and going to pickoff to the VIn point and ""borrowed"" a PEM channel to monitor what happens to the IR sensor channel. The attached picture shows how we plan to hook up the signal pickoff to the box. We have the signal trending in L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_21_OUT_DQ (the calibration of this channel is 4V/2^16cts). This signal read zero before we connected it and then went to a negative voltage (which we dont understand why). We had the laser on for a very short time and then caught it turning OFF. In the second attachment the top plot is the temporary monitoring of the IR sensor we just setup, the second plot is looking at the output of the laser, the third plot is looking at the RTD and IR sensor interlock signal and he bottom trace is the RTD/temperature of the laser. We really arent sure what to make of what we see as the ""glitch"" in the IR sensor happens 1 second after the laser went off. And the temperature of the laser would go down when the laser is off (and I see no glitch which would turn the laser off). So really not sure at the moment what this tells us, but its another data point for us to consider....

The <a href=""https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/uploads/72706_20240816175719_Monitoring.jpg"">attached picture</a> shows how we plan to hook up the signal pickoff to the box.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have the signal trending in L1:PEM-CS_ADC_4_21_OUT_DQ (the calibration of this channel is 4V/2^16cts). This signal read zero before we connected it and then went to a negative voltage (which we dont understand why). We had the laser on for a very short time and then caught it turning OFF. In the second attachment the top plot is the temporary monitoring of the IR sensor we just setup, the second plot is looking at the output of the laser, the third plot is looking at the RTD and IR sensor interlock signal and he bottom trace is the RTD/temperature of the laser. We really arent sure what to make of what we see as the &quot;glitch&quot; in the IR sensor happens 1 second after the laser went off. And the temperature of the laser would go down when the laser is off (and I see no glitch which would turn the laser off).</p>

<p>So really not sure at the moment what this tells us, but its another data point for us to consider....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CO2Y laser is still OFF as Karla and Michael are doing some experiments with the power supply as they are seeing something in relation to that.</p>

After compiling a list of vetted, non-astrophysical artifacts into the version 1 lines and combs list for O4a, we extracted some statistics for each detector in order to compare and contrast the data quality from this perspective, and to determine which of the artifacts are most problematic for long duration narrowband searches (CW or narrowband directed stochastic searches).

New for this observing run, we have two new features for the lines list: 1) artifacts with known time variation (turn on/turn off) where we can establish reasonable metrics for their presence in the data we also provide a segment list for times those artifacts are present; 2) a new type 3 artifact that is not simply a narrow frequency band for a single artifact, but rather a band (typically 1 Hz or larger) with many narrow artifacts degrading the data quality within the band.

I am posting my work here on LLO logbook as requested. This is only a (very) preliminary test of the semi-adaptive control framework that I have been developing. No configurations were changed. No systems were affected. The goal was to test a few things: 1) Basic functionality of my the framework, Seibot , programmed in Python, 2) New sensor correction and complementary filters (blends) that offer comparable low- and high-frequency performances to the ones in use, 3) Just to test and see what challenges we might face in the future. We emphasize that this is only a functionality test and not a performance test . Seibot currently supports Python and command line usages, which are not the easiest to use. Later we will be added 2 modes of usages, 1) GUI showing predicted motion with selected filters, allowing users to see effects of different filters in real time, and 2) guardian that achieve the an autonomous version of semi-adaptive control. Seibot does the following, as described in the documentation: 1) reads user configuration files, foton files, model parameters, and sensor readouts via CDSutils, 2) compile necessary data and filters to construct a simulated isolation system, 3) simulate all possible outcomes with all possible filter configurations, and finally 4) evaluate these outcomes and select a set of filters that is the best. We have generated 9 sets of sensor correction filters and 9 sets of complementary filters for the test, which are optimized for the 9 scenarios consisting of 3 levels of seismic noises and 3 levels of ground/platform tilt, using the H-infinity method . Combined with the filters in use, this gives 10*10 = 100 different seismic control configurations that populate the parameter space that we can seek optimization on. Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the magnitude responses of these filters, which are already installed in Foton. These filters have better low- and high-frequency responses compared to what was shown in SEI 2430 . Previous ones were barely functional due to low-frequency noises, and inject ~10x noises at 10 Hz. We ran the test two times, without and with seismic injection, each time we took a measurement of the HAM8-ISI motion with the filters originally in use, and with the filters suggested by Seibot. Criterion being used here is the minimum displacement RMS. Yes, we know this is not the best criterion but we use this anyway for testing's sake The filters were switched on-the-fly with the faders to ensure its functionality. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the predictions and selections of HAM8 table motion made by Seibot, without and with injection, respectively. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the measured HAM8 motions, without and with injection, respectively. The actual table motion is, roughly speaking, the minimum between the CPS and the T240 signal. Without injection, the secondary microseism is very low. In this case, the table motion is RMS dominated by the inertial noise. Therefore, Seibot prioritized low-frequency noise suppression, as indicated by the lower CPS signal in Figure 3 below 0.1 Hz, which makes seismic noise suppression above .1 Hz worse as they're not RMS dominated. With the seismic noise injection, the secondary microseism is very high and becomes relevant in RMS. This spectrum was taken from December where we experienced lock loss. As shown in Figure 4 , the filters chosen by Seibot offers better suppression everywhere, except around 1 Hz, which preliminarily proves the functionality of Seibot. We encountered a few challenges during the tests, one being tilt-horizontal coupling noise in the GS13 on the table. Since Seibot takes a 1-hr long time series in the past for estimating sensor and seismic noises dynamically, any tilt transient/gitches present within the hour would render the GS13 spectrum useless, making further prediction impossible. I don't have any good ideas how to get around this. Maybe I will have some after my long vacation.

This is only a (very) preliminary test of the semi-adaptive control framework that I have been developing. No configurations were changed. No systems were affected.<br />
The goal was to test a few things: 1) Basic functionality of my the framework, <a href=""https://github.com/terrencetec/seibot"">Seibot</a>, programmed in Python, 2) New sensor correction and complementary filters (blends) that offer comparable low- and high-frequency performances to the ones in use, 3) Just to test and see what challenges we might face in the future.<br />

In the image ITMX_PA , a spot is visible at the bottom left side of the HWS coordinates. The plan is to move the spot on ITMX up and down by a few millimeters, but yesterday afternoon, we only moved the spot up (pitch) as seen by the BS camera because IFO lost the lock due to the weather. The spot move test started at around 19:29 UTC on 08/14/2024 and lasted about 100 minutes. Since the spot cannot be moved directly on ITMs, we adjusted it on BS.

Data is in the usual calibration location: /ligo/svncommon/CalSVN/aligocalibration/trunk/Common/Electronics/L1/Data/SUSElectronics/ETMX/PUM/2024-08-20/.  Plots of data versus fits are in a sub-directory there, and attached as pdfs.  Fitting script is also in the directory, called process_TFs_to_Fit.pyCAL, SUS		<!--- Output file_0_72773 div -->

Valera pointed out that aside from the squeezing level, there seemed to be an improvement in the 30-100 Hz band too. Our operating assumption has been that the quantum noise has little effect on low frequency region. So, we decided to test this out by reverting the alignment back to Alignment A on August 1st and recording spectra. Suprisingly, this on-off test showed the extra 30-100 Hz noise was indeed due to Alignment A . [Note: this is different from the low frequnecy noise that has been plaguing us sporadically, reducing our range, see alog 72583 ] Attached plot shows the two dates with Alignment A and B, showing the same behavior. Note that the improvement in high frequency squeezing and 30-100 Hz band goes together , so we'll keep trusting our alignment strategy (which optimizes for 2kHz sqz) to give us the optimal quantum noise across the entire 20-4000 Hz band. To see if we can account for the low frequency noise with a GWINC quantum noise budget, we took spectra with different squeezing angles for Alignment A and B. The quantum noise projections for Alignment A and Alignment B for various sqz angles are attached. Also see squeezing data, quantum noise model and total noise budgets for A and B . A comparison plot for the two alignments and their associated quantum noise curves are also attached here . Since the only thing changing between the two cases is the alignment of the sqz beam, we used SQZ to OMC (and in extension SQZ to IFO mode-matching) parameters as the free parameters between the two models.

1131,14,H1 ISC - Comment to New SRCL and MICH FF fit,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/index.php?callRep=79767,https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/rss-feed.php,"Wed, 28 Aug 2024 10:13:56 -0700","Here is some more information about the fits. First, my MICH fit caused a lockloss this morning because I forgot to the check the phase on the filter. Sometimes, the phase gets flipped during the fitting. Usually, I compare the sign of the phase with the previous filter in foton and adjust accordingly, but I forgot to do it this time (rookie mistake). I have double checked the new SRCL filter phase and fixed the MICH phase. Attached are two screenshots of the fittings. First, the MICH fitting compares the current filter, labeled as ""reference 1"" with the red trace which represents the new fit. The bottom right plot compares the fit residuals. You can see from this plot that the most improvement occurs at low frequency, with some small improvement at mid frequency. The SRCL fitting has many more traces, but compare the orange ""current fit"" trace with the trace labeled ""best with less HF gain"". This has more improvement almost everywhere. There is an increase in gain at high frequency, but it is less than an order of magnitude, so I think it's ok. The new fit also has reduced the high Q feature around 300 Hz that was potentially injecting noise. There is a factor 5-10 improvement between 10-50 Hz that will help the most. ","{'term': 'H1 ISC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}","<p>Author: elenna.capote@ligo.org</p><p>Report ID: 79767</p><p>Here is some more information about the fits.</p>

<p>First, my MICH fit caused a lockloss this morning because I forgot to the check the phase on the filter. Sometimes, the phase gets flipped during the fitting. Usually, I compare the sign of the phase with the previous filter in foton and adjust accordingly, but I forgot to do it this time (rookie mistake). I have double checked the new SRCL filter phase and fixed the MICH phase.</p>

<p>Attached are two screenshots of the fittings. First, <a href=""https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/uploads/79767_20240828100843_MICH_fitting_8_27_24.png"">the MICH fitting</a> compares the current filter, labeled as &quot;reference 1&quot; with the red trace which represents the new fit. The bottom right plot compares the fit residuals. You can see from this plot that the most improvement occurs at low frequency, with some small improvement at mid frequency. <a href=""https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/uploads/79767_20240828100848_SRCL_FF_8_27_24_fitting.png"">The SRCL fitting</a> has many more traces, but compare the orange &quot;current fit&quot; trace with the trace labeled &quot;best with less HF gain&quot;. This has more improvement almost everywhere. There is an increase in gain at high frequency, but it is less than an order of magnitude, so I think it's ok. The new fit also has reduced the high Q feature around 300 Hz that was potentially injecting noise. There is a factor 5-10 improvement between 10-50 Hz that will help the most.</p>

Oberling, R. Short The FSS RefCav TPD had been trending down again, and Ryan did not get enough improvement from a remote alignment tweak last week . So today we went into the enclosure to do an on-table alignment of the FSS RefCav beam path. As usual, we began with a power budget: FSS In: 282.9 mW AOM In: 283.2 mW AOM Out, SP: 174.4 mW SP Diffraction Efficiency: 61.6% AOM Out, DP: 122.8 mW DP Diffraction Efficiency: 70.4% EOM Out: 121.4 mW No, we're not getting magic amplification between the FSS In and AOM In power measurements; that kind of small discrepancy is normal with the small stick power meter head we use for this alignment (they are also very AOI dependent, so it's entirely possible we had the head better aligned to the beam for the AOM In measurement). Immediately we see the single-pass diffraction efficiency is lower than it normally is (generally hangs out in the lower 70% range these days), so we began by adjusting the AOM alignment to improve it. This also means we have to then adjust M21 to improve the double-pass diffraction efficiency. After the adjustments we had: AOM Out, SP: 199.4 mW SP Diffraction Efficiency: 70.4% AOM Out, DP: 143.3 mW DP Diffraction Efficiency: 71.9% This is the lowest we've seen the diffraction efficiencies of this AOM, and suggests maybe it's time to swap the AOM for a new one (pretty sure this is the same AOM installed with the PSL in 2012, would have to go back through the alog to see if it's been swapped since install). As usual, we had to do some small tweaks to the FSS EOM (provides the 21.5 MHz PDH sidebands for RefCav locking), and had to tweak the beam alignment into the RefCav using the input iris. Once done, the RefCav locked without issue and our picomotor mounts were used to maximize the RefCav TPD; we began with a TPD of 0.57 V and ended with a TPD of 0.82 V . We've had it higher in the past, but we have less power out of the PMC than usual (due to our slowly increasing PMC Refl that we have yet to figure out the cause of), and less power out of the PMC means less power available for the FSS RefCav which means lower maximum RefCav TPD. To end we realigned the beam onto the RefCav RFPD and took a visibility measurement: Unlocked: 1.162 V Locked: 0.221 V Visibility: 81.0% This finished the FSS RefCav tune-up, so we left the enclosure. We left the ISS OFF while the enclosure returns to thermal equilibrium; it will be turned back ON once that equilibrium is reached, and Ryan will do a rotation stage calibration.

<p>No, we're not getting magic amplification between the FSS In and AOM In power measurements; that kind of small discrepancy is normal with the small stick power meter head we use for this alignment (they are also very AOI dependent, so it's entirely possible we had the head better aligned to the beam for the AOM In measurement).&nbsp; Immediately we see the single-pass diffraction efficiency is lower than it normally is (generally hangs out in the lower 70% range these days), so we began by adjusting the AOM alignment to improve it.&nbsp; This also means we have to then adjust M21 to improve the double-pass diffraction efficiency.&nbsp; After the adjustments we had:</p>

<ul>
	<li>AOM Out, SP: 199.4 mW
	<ul>
		<li>SP Diffraction Efficiency: 70.4%</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>AOM Out, DP: 143.3 mW
	<ul>
		<li>DP Diffraction Efficiency: 71.9%</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the lowest we've seen the diffraction efficiencies of this AOM, and suggests maybe it's time to swap the AOM for a new one (pretty sure this is the same AOM installed with the PSL in 2012, would have to go back through the alog to see if it's been swapped since install).&nbsp; As usual, we had to do some small tweaks to the FSS EOM (provides the 21.5 MHz PDH sidebands for RefCav locking), and had to tweak the beam alignment into the RefCav using the input iris.&nbsp; Once done, the RefCav locked without issue and our picomotor mounts were used to maximize the RefCav TPD; we began with a TPD of <strong>0.57 V</strong> and ended with a TPD of <strong>0.82 V</strong>.&nbsp; We've had it higher in the past, but we have less power out of the PMC than usual (due to our slowly increasing PMC Refl that we have yet to figure out the cause of), and less power out of the PMC means less power available for the FSS RefCav which means lower maximum RefCav TPD.&nbsp; To end we realigned the beam onto the RefCav RFPD and took a visibility measurement:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Unlocked: 1.162 V</li>
	<li>Locked: 0.221 V</li>
	<li>Visibility: 81.0%</li>
</ul>

<p>This finished the FSS RefCav tune-up, so we left the enclosure.&nbsp; We left the ISS OFF while the enclosure returns to thermal equilibrium; it will be turned back ON once that equilibrium is reached, and Ryan will do a rotation stage calibration.&nbsp; This closes LHO WP <a href=""https://services2.ligo-la.caltech.edu/LHO/workpermits/view.php?permit_id=12057"">12057</a>.</p>",79736,jason.oberling@ligo.org

I did have to steer the spot on ETMX for the ALSX to lock, the Guardian was giving that ALS user code error before the spot was aligned.

We found that at both end stations, the mechanical shaking produces fringing at multiples of ~7 Hz in DARM . Once we found the fringing, we did additional shaking tests to try and find the exact frequency that produces the maximum fringing. At EX that frequency is ~7.185 Hz. At EY that frequency is ~7.45 Hz. In addition to the fringing, we also found that shaking at these frequencies created some higher frequency shelves (100-400 Hz depending on the amplitude of the shaking). The shelves were more pronounced at EX than EY where they were barely peeking out above DARM but still perceptible. Modeling both the shelves and the harmonics, it seems like they are from different coupling sources. 7 times more motion is required to produce the shelves than the harmonics and the selves seems like there is less light amplitude. The motion to produce the harmonics seems consistent with what we drove with the shaker but the shelves is 7 times more. We tried shaking at the manifold and the spool to try and triangulate the location of the coupling but our accelerometers saw too similar shaking at both locations. We believe that the ~7 Hz is a structural resonance of the beamtube near this location The ~7 Hz peak that is there in the accelerometers varies over time in amplitude but not frequency.

The intent is to help evaluate the impact of 72765 and compare to previous 11.9 Hz comb studies. The comb decreased in strength mid O4a, and was fairly weak in the latter part of O4a. However, it increased again between O4a and O4b. There have been two examples of relatively short (1-2 weeks) exceptionally strong time periods followed by a sharp drop-off. Of these: one drop seems to align with an ETMX bias sign change on Sept 12, 2023 ( 67581 ). one drop seems to align with the recent EX Beckhoff relocation on Aug 20, 2024 ( 72765 ). There are other, less drastic but still distinct changes over both O4a and O4b (see plots). Below, I link to a number of interactive plots, because these are useful for seeing the detailed behavior/structure of the comb. I have also attached static images of the same plots, in case the interactive versions are accidentally deleted at a later time. History of the comb Tracking the first two (strongest) peaks at 11.9 and 35.7 Hz Tracking all comb peaks in the 10-100 Hz range How to read the history plots: the small colorful dots show the height of peak of the comb (specifically, odd harmonics of 11.9046967 Hz) in the specified frequency range. You can use the color bar and the mouseover text to get the specific frequency information. The square black dots show the median height of all the peaks considered, to provide a general measurement of the comb height. Their hover text gives the date, and the number of 1800s SFTs averaged to create the spectrum from which that data point is drawn. The small blue lines show the 1st and 99th percentile of all the data in the band, and are mainly a visual check for unreliable data (generally due to low SFT counts, and indicated by a wide separation of the small blue lines); they are less important for interpreting the plot. The ""height"" here is normalized average power, as computed with Fscans. That is, the height is relative to the noise floor in the spectral region nearby the peak. For more detail, the representative plots below show a daily average PSD, also from Fscans, but which is not normalized.

The small blue lines show the 1st and 99th percentile of all the data in the band, and are mainly a visual check for unreliable data (generally due to low SFT counts, and indicated by a wide separation of the small blue lines); they are less important for interpreting the plot.</p>

<p>The &quot;height&quot; here is normalized average power, as computed with Fscans. That is, the height is relative to the noise floor in the spectral region nearby the peak. For more detail, the representative plots below show a daily average PSD, also from Fscans, but which is not normalized.</p>

Usually, the range variations were seen with the timescales of 12 hours or so. But, sometimes, we also see smaller BNS range variations of half-hour/hour time scales. On Aug 18, 2024, due to PCALY failure, the range dropped to ~100 Mpc for an hour or so. We observe excess noise in the 20 - 80 Hz band during the times of low BNS range ( figure1 ). We see excess low SNR (~ < 5) omicron triggers in the 50- 100 Hz band during the times of low BNS range ( figure 2 ). We see a bit of disjoint between the frequency regions in the strain noise spectrogram and the omicron triggers. During most of the days in this week, we see that the rate of the SNR triggers (SNR > 5) starts low at the beginning of the lock and steadily increases (by a factor of 2 or 3) in an hour or two and then stays there or comes down a little after few hours ( figure 3 ). This is especially true when there is a long gap between the locks. We do not see strong features in the PEM channels (accelerometers and mics) that correlate with the noise in DARM. We also do not see any consistent channels showing up in LASSO tracking the slow variations in range. In Hveto, the following channels consistently appear as winners of the first few rounds. However, their efficiency in removing the glitches is not high. L1:ASC-Y_TR_B_NSUM_OUT_DQ, L1:LSC-REFL_A_LF_OUT_DQ Also, on the day of the power glitch (Aug 15, 2024), L1:PEM-CS_MAG_LVEA_VERTEX_X_DQ shows up as one of the winners vetoing glitches just before the lockloss (due to the power glitch). In Fscan, we don't see any obvious new set of lines during this week.

The first attachment shows a few days of this variation, in range and darm bands that are affected. Second attachment : We did one test of changing the EX VEA temperature last week, and that seemed to quickly affect the range, but we lost lock an hour after. We retained that set point for a week (67F), but the 12 hr range oscillation continued. So this week we did another few steps between the two temperatures, and while they seem to affect the range, it's not in the same way as before. However, the correlation is there. It almost seems like a transient behavior, ie something happens when we change the temperature, but when it's back to normal operation, the exact setpoint doesn't affect things? Third attachment: We then also did the same temperature test at EY, but only one step to 67F and back to 68F, the range seemed unaffected. It was not constant during the test, but there are no additional changes/kinks at the times of the EY temp changes (unlike EX). This makes EY less likely to be the culprit.
