1. **Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors:**
   - **DC Power Monitors Reporting Incorrect Voltage:**
     - In Dataset 2, several DC power monitors installed to monitor the corner station supplies reported incorrect or anomalous voltage readings. For instance, SUS C6A 18V L VDC C and SEI C 18V L VDC C reported lower monitor voltages than actual, indicating potential issues with the supply itself or the monitor calibration.

2. **Alterations to Particular Sensors:**
    - **Installation of DC Power Monitors:**
     - New DC power monitors were installed at the corner station supplies to monitor various voltage racks. These monitors were meant to provide real-time data on the power status and help in quicker diagnosis and maintenance. However, initial outputs showed zeros due to a misconfigured IP address which was corrected later. Despite the correction, some monitors continued to report errors.

    - **Shutter Logic Box Replacement:**
     - Due to intermittent issues with a shutter not closing properly, the shutter logic box (which controls the opening and closing of the shutter) was swapped with a spare. This alteration was necessary to ensure that the shutter operates reliably, as issues with the shutter can affect the observatory’s ability to control light exposure to sensitive instruments.
