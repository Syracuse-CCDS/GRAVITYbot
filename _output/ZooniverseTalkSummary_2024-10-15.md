1. **Novel Glitch Classes in Talk Dataset 2:**
   - **"Invisible Violins"**: This glitch class is mentioned in Talk Dataset 2 as an observation correlated with specific frequency phenomena. It appears to associate with certain frequencies and is metaphorically related to the violin modes known from the suspensions in LIGO but is characterized by its 'invisibility' or subtle detection characteristics.
