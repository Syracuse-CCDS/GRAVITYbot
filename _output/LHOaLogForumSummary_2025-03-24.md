### Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors

1. **SQZ OPO LR High Rejected Power**
   - The Squeezer's OPO (Optical Parametric Oscillator) LR (Low Reflectivity) node reported high rejected power, which could indicate issues with alignment or optical efficiency. This issue appeared recurrently and is crucial because it affects the squeezer's ability to function correctly, impacting the entire observing system's sensitivity.

2. **Squeezer Automatically Returning but with Recurring Issues**
   - There were instances noted where the squeezer would drop from observing due to issues with the OPO LR but then return automatically. This recurrent issue suggests intermittent problems possibly related to the stability or control systems of the squeezer, crucial for maintaining the integrity of data collection.

### Alterations to Particular Sensors

1. **Adjustment of ISS Array Sensors**
   - The ISS (Input Sensor System) array sensors underwent various adjustments, including the setup with oscilloscopes and the addition of a polarising beamsplitter to check for effects of polarization on the measurement. Adjustments aim to optimize the array's responsiveness and accuracy, crucial for ensuring the fidelity of input sensing.
