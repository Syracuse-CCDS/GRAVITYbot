User Prompt: 
    For the following text data, provide a list of primary topics of the data:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst? Maybe even a combination of glitches? maybe #scatteredlight :)
Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates forum conversations for physicists and engineers.
    
User Prompt:  
    The data which I am giving you is forum data from Gravity Spy called "Talk" data. Gravity Spy is a citizen science project which classifies glitches that occur because of enviornmental effects or engineering issues related to gravitational wave sensors designed by LIGO. I am interested in knowing emerging conversations over time. For example, it is valuable to know if there are new glitches that don't yet have a classification. Or alternatively, it might be valuable to know if there are emerging questions that the citizen scientists are having, or solutions they think they have to older classification problems.
    
    Consider the following Talk data:
     ZngabitanT Good to know thanks Certainly the feature around 100 Hz is more prominent than the hfb but I didnt know what to make of it Happy 2023 bliplet at 49hz hybrid line at 24hz and scattered light Repeating koi and fireballs fireballkoi  fireballkoi  fireballkoi  hfb plus a circular glitch with horns around 45hz fireballkoi  Or is it a tomte I will put it with the bliplets in any case Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the eiffel that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of baby Tomtes intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call lower frequency blips meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what weve been calling bliplets of late There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under 40 and just over 60 Hz mostly in the bins around 40 and 50 Hz where were finding the bliplets too Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3 Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between 20191113 and 20191122 But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples Ive also started doing a little in this direction but its done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnishrun topattached kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow Thank you and happy whatsnowleftof2023 to you too  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data The spectrogram images are merely the icing on the cake they do not preserve enough of the relevant information adding some eye candy for the benefit of a broader audience As a guideline

here theres a central Virgo O3 angelprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961958345 dominating the scene corroborated by the 640 Hz peak frequency with a weather vaneprojectszooniversegravityspytalk7291890614 embedded slightly later This in itself is somewhat remarkable While such angelweather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O3 its the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll modeprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31962626575comment4297701 damper was disabled On a few dozen other occasions the 97 Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far This subject was recorded on 20190729 at some point between 032805815 and 032806 UTC And from a mere 0185 seconds later we have the overlapping continuation S50419949 of S50414860 now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around 65 Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane The interferometer stayed locked for another 8 seconds or so and lost lock at 032814 Science Mode was reestablished by 0356 The plots attached to the night shift reporthttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46507 show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isnt clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before 032805 and then simultaneous bumps in the

point tunedhttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46517 later on 20190729 implying it hadnt been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost We dont know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that havent been included among these plots were doing at the time I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be Its got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss I do have a few robust ideas what it cant be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots eg PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB2 needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range This was donehttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46510 a little later on 20190729 If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGOs DHARD and TX TY representing thetaX thetaY are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesnt have the PR2 PR3 folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others And it can open without the MetatronGuardianlevel automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more From the events of 20190715T193537 UTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46381 it cant be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see 50390322projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects50390322 from 20190713T215420 UTC elog 46355httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46355 Wherever theres a BNS range plot available around the time in question eg see again 20190715T193537 UTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46381 weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on 20190713 when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 02 Mpc Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode A common feature of most of the prelockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions 10Hz or 95Hz or 97Hz oscillations which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damperprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31962626575comment4297701 When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on 20191206httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor47915 fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 194 Hz roll mode harmonics only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 20200314 So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day 20190729 when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see 5041486050419949projectszooniversegravityspytalk3282747909 In particular the loop were looking for is not that of the damper itself A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a pickedoff beam centered on a quadrant photodiode The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop The causal connections remain mysterious for now West End 97 Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop The relatively frequent weather vane angelprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961958345 combinations together with the run of angelwillow compound glitches from November 2019 and the fact that Willowsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961708892 are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injectioninput side of the interferometer But thats not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadnt been what triggered the subject What would this disturbance be classified as It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin  Well observed and a peculiar catch It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses shortduration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesnt want to fit into the available classes Weve embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class Youll find several relevant discussion threads eg in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass bliplet with an unusually abrupt transition from body to tail but Im not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the tail above it laughinglaughinglaughing and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow I wasnt sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but its the best classification I could find for it Thanks Nicm25 Im glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily Its interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next  Several scattered light among those Nicm25 Thanks for all your timestamps possiblenewglitch possiblenewglitch

    Now, explain what is new or emergent in the following Talk data by comparison:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst Maybe even a combination of glitches maybe scatteredlight Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time timestamp 20200223T183132 near time subject 40450211projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450211 according to I own

repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk762917436 and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these

part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicm25 has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450189 looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450234 looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450218 firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame

often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other

together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency

recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm25 The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nicm25 I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates forum conversations for physicists and engineers.
    
User Prompt:  
    The data which I am giving you is forum data from Gravity Spy called "Talk" data. Gravity Spy is a citizen science project which classifies glitches that occur because of enviornmental effects or engineering issues related to gravitational wave sensors designed by LIGO. I am interested in knowing emerging conversations over time. For example, it is valuable to know if there are new glitches that don't yet have a classification. Or alternatively, it might be valuable to know if there are emerging questions that the citizen scientists are having, or solutions they think they have to older classification problems.
    
    Consider the following Talk data:
     ZngabitanT Good to know thanks Certainly the feature around 100 Hz is more prominent than the hfb but I didnt know what to make of it Happy 2023 bliplet at 49hz hybrid line at 24hz and scattered light Repeating koi and fireballs fireballkoi  fireballkoi  fireballkoi  hfb plus a circular glitch with horns around 45hz fireballkoi  Or is it a tomte I will put it with the bliplets in any case Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the eiffel that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of baby Tomtes intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call lower frequency blips meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what weve been calling bliplets of late There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under 40 and just over 60 Hz mostly in the bins around 40 and 50 Hz where were finding the bliplets too Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3 Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between 20191113 and 20191122 But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples Ive also started doing a little in this direction but its done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnishrun topattached kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow Thank you and happy whatsnowleftof2023 to you too  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data The spectrogram images are merely the icing on the cake they do not preserve enough of the relevant information adding some eye candy for the benefit of a broader audience As a guideline

here theres a central Virgo O3 angelprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961958345 dominating the scene corroborated by the 640 Hz peak frequency with a weather vaneprojectszooniversegravityspytalk7291890614 embedded slightly later This in itself is somewhat remarkable While such angelweather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O3 its the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll modeprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31962626575comment4297701 damper was disabled On a few dozen other occasions the 97 Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far This subject was recorded on 20190729 at some point between 032805815 and 032806 UTC And from a mere 0185 seconds later we have the overlapping continuation S50419949 of S50414860 now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around 65 Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane The interferometer stayed locked for another 8 seconds or so and lost lock at 032814 Science Mode was reestablished by 0356 The plots attached to the night shift reporthttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46507 show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isnt clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before 032805 and then simultaneous bumps in the

point tunedhttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46517 later on 20190729 implying it hadnt been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost We dont know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that havent been included among these plots were doing at the time I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be Its got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss I do have a few robust ideas what it cant be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots eg PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB2 needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range This was donehttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46510 a little later on 20190729 If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGOs DHARD and TX TY representing thetaX thetaY are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesnt have the PR2 PR3 folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others And it can open without the MetatronGuardianlevel automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more From the events of 20190715T193537 UTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46381 it cant be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see 50390322projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects50390322 from 20190713T215420 UTC elog 46355httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46355 Wherever theres a BNS range plot available around the time in question eg see again 20190715T193537 UTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46381 weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on 20190713 when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 02 Mpc Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode A common feature of most of the prelockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions 10Hz or 95Hz or 97Hz oscillations which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damperprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31962626575comment4297701 When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on 20191206httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor47915 fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 194 Hz roll mode harmonics only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 20200314 So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day 20190729 when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see 5041486050419949projectszooniversegravityspytalk3282747909 In particular the loop were looking for is not that of the damper itself A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a pickedoff beam centered on a quadrant photodiode The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop The causal connections remain mysterious for now West End 97 Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop The relatively frequent weather vane angelprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961958345 combinations together with the run of angelwillow compound glitches from November 2019 and the fact that Willowsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961708892 are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injectioninput side of the interferometer But thats not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadnt been what triggered the subject What would this disturbance be classified as It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin  Well observed and a peculiar catch It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses shortduration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesnt want to fit into the available classes Weve embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class Youll find several relevant discussion threads eg in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass bliplet with an unusually abrupt transition from body to tail but Im not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the tail above it laughinglaughinglaughing and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow I wasnt sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but its the best classification I could find for it Thanks Nicm25 Im glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily Its interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next  Several scattered light among those Nicm25 Thanks for all your timestamps possiblenewglitch possiblenewglitch

    Now, explain what is new or emergent in the following Talk data by comparison:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst Maybe even a combination of glitches maybe scatteredlight Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light I think it was after

repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk762917436 and could be classified as None

part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicm25 has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450189 looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450234 looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450218 firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame

together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency

recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm25 The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nicm25 I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates forum conversations for physicists and engineers.
    
User Prompt:  
    The data which I am giving you is forum data from Gravity Spy called "Talk" data. Gravity Spy is a citizen science project which classifies glitches that occur because of enviornmental effects or engineering issues related to gravitational wave sensors designed by LIGO. I am interested in knowing emerging conversations over time. For example, it is valuable to know if there are new glitches that don't yet have a classification. Or alternatively, it might be valuable to know if there are emerging questions that the citizen scientists are having, or solutions they think they have to older classification problems.
    
    Consider the following Talk data:
     ZngabitanT Good to know thanks Certainly the feature around 100 Hz is more prominent than the hfb but I didnt know what to make of it Happy 2023 bliplet at 49hz hybrid line at 24hz and scattered light Repeating koi and fireballs fireballkoi  fireballkoi  fireballkoi  hfb plus a circular glitch with horns around 45hz fireballkoi  Or is it a tomte I will put it with the bliplets in any case Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the eiffel that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of baby Tomtes intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call lower frequency blips meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what weve been calling bliplets of late There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under 40 and just over 60 Hz mostly in the bins around 40 and 50 Hz where were finding the bliplets too Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3 Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between 20191113 and 20191122 But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples Ive also started doing a little in this direction but its done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnishrun topattached kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow Thank you and happy whatsnowleftof2023 to you too  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw

here theres a central Virgo O3 angelprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961958345 dominating the scene corroborated by the 640 Hz peak frequency with a weather vaneprojectszooniversegravityspytalk7291890614 embedded slightly later This in itself is somewhat remarkable While such angelweather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O3 its the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll modeprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31962626575comment4297701 damper was disabled On a few dozen other occasions the 97 Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far This subject was recorded on 20190729 at some point between 032805815 and 032806 UTC And from a mere 0185 seconds later we have the overlapping continuation S50419949 of S50414860 now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around 65 Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane The interferometer stayed locked for another 8 seconds or so and lost lock at 032814 Science Mode was reestablished by 0356 The plots attached to the night shift reporthttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46507 show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isnt clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before 032805 and then simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at 032813 and then the IMC lock dropped plots around the 20190729T032814

point tunedhttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46517 later on 20190729 implying it hadnt been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost We dont know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that havent been included among these plots were doing at the time I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be Its got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss I do have a few robust ideas what it cant be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots eg PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB2 needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range This was donehttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46510 a little later on 20190729 If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGOs DHARD and TX TY representing thetaX thetaY are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesnt have the PR2 PR3 folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others And it can open without the MetatronGuardianlevel automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more From the events of 20190715T193537 UTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46381 it cant be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see 50390322projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects50390322 from 20190713T215420 UTC elog 46355httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46355 Wherever theres a BNS range plot available around the time in question eg see again 20190715T193537 UTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46381 weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on 20190713 when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 02 Mpc Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode A common feature of most of the prelockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions 10Hz or 95Hz or 97Hz oscillations which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damperprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31962626575comment4297701 When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on 20191206httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor47915 fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 194 Hz roll mode harmonics only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 20200314 So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day 20190729 when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see 5041486050419949projectszooniversegravityspytalk3282747909 In particular the loop were looking for is not that of the damper itself A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a pickedoff beam centered on a quadrant photodiode The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop The causal connections remain mysterious for now West End 97 Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop The relatively frequent weather vane angelprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961958345 combinations together with the run of angelwillow compound glitches from November 2019 and the fact that Willowsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961708892 are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injectioninput side of the interferometer But thats not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadnt been what triggered the subject What would this disturbance be classified as It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin  Well observed and a peculiar catch It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses shortduration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesnt want to fit into the available classes Weve embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class Youll find several relevant discussion threads eg in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass bliplet with an unusually abrupt transition from body to tail but Im not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the tail above it laughinglaughinglaughing and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow I wasnt sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but its the best classification I could find for it Thanks Nicm25 Im glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily Its interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next  Several scattered light among those Nicm25 Thanks for all your timestamps possiblenewglitch possiblenewglitch

    Now, explain what is new or emergent in the following Talk data by comparison:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst Maybe even a combination of glitches maybe scatteredlight Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time timestamp 20200223T183132 near time subject 40450211projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450211 according to I own

repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk762917436 and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these glitches that isnt well understood yet Youre very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now Hanford Fireballish with

regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organprojectszooniversegravityspycollectionszngabitantloudblipgroupsymmetricwithkoigrandorgan Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicm25 has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450189 looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450234 looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450218 firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame

often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other

arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening 50324234 frame

together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency

recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm25 The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nicm25 I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates forum conversations for physicists and engineers.
    
User Prompt:  
    The data which I am giving you is forum data from Gravity Spy called "Talk" data. Gravity Spy is a citizen science project which classifies glitches that occur because of enviornmental effects or engineering issues related to gravitational wave sensors designed by LIGO. I am interested in knowing emerging conversations over time. For example, it is valuable to know if there are new glitches that don't yet have a classification. Or alternatively, it might be valuable to know if there are emerging questions that the citizen scientists are having, or solutions they think they have to older classification problems.
    
    Consider the following Talk data:
     ZngabitanT Good to know thanks Certainly the feature around 100 Hz is more prominent than the hfb but I didnt know what to make of it Happy 2023 bliplet at 49hz hybrid line at 24hz and scattered light Repeating koi and fireballs fireballkoi  fireballkoi  fireballkoi  hfb plus a circular glitch with horns around 45hz fireballkoi  Or is it a tomte I will put it with the bliplets in any case Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the eiffel that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of baby Tomtes intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call lower frequency blips meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what weve been calling bliplets of late There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under 40 and just over 60 Hz mostly in the bins around 40 and 50 Hz where were finding the bliplets too Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3 Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between 20191113 and 20191122 But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples Ive also started doing a little in this direction but its done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnishrun topattached kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow Thank you and happy whatsnowleftof2023 to you too  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data The spectrogram images are merely the icing on the cake they do not preserve enough of the relevant information adding some eye candy for the benefit of a broader audience As a guideline

modeprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31962626575comment4297701 damper was disabled On a few dozen other occasions the 97 Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far This subject was recorded on 20190729 at some point between 032805815 and 032806 UTC And from a mere 0185 seconds later we have the overlapping continuation S50419949 of S50414860 now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around 65 Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane The interferometer stayed locked for another 8 seconds or so and lost lock at 032814 Science Mode was reestablished by 0356 The plots attached to the night shift reporthttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46507 show angular

point tunedhttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46517 later on 20190729 implying it hadnt been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost We dont know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that havent been included among these plots were doing at the time I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be Its got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss I do have a few robust ideas what it cant be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots eg PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB2 needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range This was donehttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46510 a little later on 20190729 If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGOs DHARD and TX TY representing thetaX thetaY are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesnt have the PR2 PR3 folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others And it can open without the MetatronGuardianlevel automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more From the events of 20190715T193537 UTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46381 it cant be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see 50390322projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects50390322 from 20190713T215420 UTC elog 46355httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46355 Wherever theres a BNS range plot available around the time in question eg see again 20190715T193537 UTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46381 weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on 20190713 when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 02 Mpc Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode A common feature of most of the prelockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions 10Hz or 95Hz or 97Hz oscillations which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damperprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31962626575comment4297701 When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on 20191206httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor47915 fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 194 Hz roll mode harmonics only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 20200314 So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day 20190729 when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see 5041486050419949projectszooniversegravityspytalk3282747909 In particular the loop were looking for is not that of the damper itself A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a pickedoff beam centered on a quadrant photodiode The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop The causal connections remain mysterious for now West End 97 Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop The relatively frequent weather vane angelprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961958345 combinations together with the run of angelwillow compound glitches from November 2019 and the fact that Willowsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961708892 are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injectioninput side of the interferometer But thats not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadnt been what triggered the subject What would this disturbance be classified as It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin  Well observed and a peculiar catch It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses shortduration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesnt want to fit into the available classes Weve embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class Youll find several relevant discussion threads eg in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass bliplet with an unusually abrupt transition from body to tail but Im not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the tail above it laughinglaughinglaughing and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow I wasnt sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but its the best classification I could find for it Thanks Nicm25 Im glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily Its interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next  Several scattered light among those Nicm25 Thanks for all your timestamps possiblenewglitch possiblenewglitch

    Now, explain what is new or emergent in the following Talk data by comparison:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst Maybe even a combination of glitches maybe scatteredlight Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time timestamp 20200223T183132 near time subject 40450211projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450211 according to I own

repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk762917436 and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these glitches that isnt well understood yet Youre very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and

regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organprojectszooniversegravityspycollectionszngabitantloudblipgroupsymmetricwithkoigrandorgan Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicm25 has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450189 looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450234 looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450218 firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame

often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other

arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening 50324234 frame

together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency

recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm25 The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nicm25 I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy

    Additionally, in this comparison, if Talk data includes discussion of glitches, comparison tools, or propositions of new glitch classes, what specifically does the Talk data propose or ask about the glitches, propositions, or new gltich classes?

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates forum conversations for physicists and engineers.
    
User Prompt:  
    Below I will provide data from Gravity Spy called "Talk" data. Gravity Spy is a citizen science project which classifies glitches that occur because of enviornmental effects or engineering issues related to gravitational wave sensors designed by LIGO. I am interested in seeing differences from one set of Talk data to another set. In particular, it would be valuable to summarize major questions or discoveries in the talk data. For example, it is valuable to know if there are new glitches that don't yet have a classification, or if there are emerging questions that the citizen scientists are having, or solutions they think they have to older classification problems.
    
    Consider the following Talk data:
     ZngabitanT Good to know thanks Certainly the feature around 100 Hz is more prominent than the hfb but I didnt know what to make of it Happy 2023 bliplet at 49hz hybrid line at 24hz and scattered light Repeating koi and fireballs fireballkoi  fireballkoi  fireballkoi  hfb plus a circular glitch with horns around 45hz fireballkoi  Or is it a tomte I will put it with the bliplets in any case Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the eiffel that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of baby Tomtes intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call lower frequency blips meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what weve been calling bliplets of late There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under 40 and just over 60 Hz mostly in the bins around 40 and 50 Hz where were finding the bliplets too Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3 Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between 20191113 and 20191122 But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples Ive also started doing a little in this direction but its done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnishrun topattached kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow Thank you and happy whatsnowleftof2023 to you too  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data The spectrogram images are merely the icing on the cake they do not preserve enough of the relevant information adding some eye candy for the benefit of a broader audience As a guideline

vaneprojectszooniversegravityspytalk7291890614 embedded slightly later This in itself is somewhat remarkable While such angelweather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O3 its the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll modeprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31962626575comment4297701 damper was disabled On a few dozen other occasions the 97 Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far This subject was recorded on 20190729 at some point between 032805815 and 032806 UTC And from a mere 0185 seconds later we have the overlapping continuation S50419949 of S50414860 now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around 65 Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane The interferometer stayed locked for another 8 seconds or so and lost lock at 032814 Science Mode was reestablished by 0356 The plots attached to the night shift reporthttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46507 show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isnt clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before 032805 and then simultaneous bumps in the

point tunedhttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46517 later on 20190729 implying it hadnt been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost We dont know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that havent been included among these plots were doing at the time I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be Its got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss I do have a few robust ideas what it cant be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots eg PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB2 needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range This was donehttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46510 a little later on 20190729 If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGOs DHARD and TX TY representing thetaX thetaY are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesnt have the PR2 PR3 folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others And it can open without the MetatronGuardianlevel automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more From the events of 20190715T193537 UTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46381 it cant be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see 50390322projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects50390322 from 20190713T215420 UTC elog 46355httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46355 Wherever theres a BNS range plot available around the time in question eg see again 20190715T193537 UTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46381 weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on 20190713 when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 02 Mpc Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode A common feature of most of the prelockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions 10Hz or 95Hz or 97Hz oscillations which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damperprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31962626575comment4297701 When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on 20191206httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor47915 fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 194 Hz roll mode harmonics only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 20200314 So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day 20190729 when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see 5041486050419949projectszooniversegravityspytalk3282747909 In particular the loop were looking for is not that of the damper itself A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a pickedoff beam centered on a quadrant photodiode The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop The causal connections remain mysterious for now West End 97 Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop The relatively frequent weather vane angelprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961958345 combinations together with the run of angelwillow compound glitches from November 2019 and the fact that Willowsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961708892 are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injectioninput side of the interferometer But thats not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadnt been what triggered the subject What would this disturbance be classified as It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin  Well observed and a peculiar catch It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses shortduration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesnt want to fit into the available classes Weve embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class Youll find several relevant discussion threads eg in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass bliplet with an unusually abrupt transition from body to tail but Im not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the tail above it laughinglaughinglaughing and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow I wasnt sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but its the best classification I could find for it Thanks Nicm25 Im glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily Its interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next  Several scattered light among those Nicm25 Thanks for all your timestamps possiblenewglitch possiblenewglitch

    Now, explain what is new or emergent in the following Talk data by comparison:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst Maybe even a combination of glitches maybe scatteredlight Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time timestamp 20200223T183132 near time subject 40450211projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450211 according to I own

repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk762917436 and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these

regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organprojectszooniversegravityspycollectionszngabitantloudblipgroupsymmetricwithkoigrandorgan Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicm25 has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450189 looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450234 looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450218 firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame

often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other

arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening 50324234 frame

together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency

recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm25 The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nicm25 I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy

    Additionally, in this comparison, if Talk data includes discussion of glitches, comparison tools, or propositions of new glitch classes, what specifically does the Talk data propose or ask about the glitches, propositions, or new gltich classes?

There is a focus on identifying and categorizing these new types of glitches, such as the borderline cases between scattered light and low frequency bursts.\n   - There are propositions for new glitch classes, such as "borderline varnish run blip" for subjects that extend brightly to the top but are bluish in color, indicating a potential new subclass within the Blip category.\n   - Citizen scientists are actively discussing and proposing classifications for the observed glitches, such as identifying repeating koi fish classes and variations in blip characteristics like bliplets and varnish run blips.\n\n2. **Discussion on Units and Features**:\n   - Questions about the units used in the data visualization tools are raised, indicating a curiosity about the normalization and representation of glitch energy levels.\n   - Observations are made about the features of the glitches, such as the appearance of X-shaped or helix-like structures, which prompt discussions on whether they fit existing glitch classes or require new classifications.\n\n3. **Tool Utilization and Comparison**:\n   - The Gravity Spy tools, like the Similarity Search tool, are utilized to compare and analyze different glitches for similarities and differences, aiding in the classification and understanding of the data.\n   - Discussions include comparisons between different glitch types, such as scattered light and low frequency bursts, to refine the understanding of their characteristics and origins.\n\n4. **Proposals for Collection Creation**:\n   - There are suggestions to start new collections to group similar glitches together, such as creating collections for specific subclasses like varnish run blips or borderline cases that do not fit neatly into existing categories.\n   - The proposal to create collections for specific glitch types indicates a collaborative effort among citizen scientists to organize and analyze the vast amount of data generated by the Gravity Spy project.\n\nOverall, the Talk data in the second set reflects a continued exploration and refinement of glitch classifications, discussions on glitch characteristics, and the utilization of tools for comparison and analysis to enhance the understanding of gravitational wave sensor glitches.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713481408, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_d9767fc5b9', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=458, prompt_tokens=12483, total_tokens=12941))

User Prompt: 
    Consider the following Talk data:
     ZngabitanT Good to know thanks Certainly the feature around 100 Hz is more prominent than the hfb but I didnt know what to make of it Happy 2023 bliplet at 49hz hybrid line at 24hz and scattered light Repeating koi and fireballs fireballkoi  fireballkoi  fireballkoi  hfb plus a circular glitch with horns around 45hz fireballkoi  Or is it a tomte I will put it with the bliplets in any case Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the eiffel that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of baby Tomtes intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call lower frequency blips meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what weve been calling bliplets of late There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under 40 and just over 60 Hz mostly in the bins around 40 and 50 Hz where were finding the bliplets too Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3 Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between 20191113 and 20191122 But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples Ive also started doing a little in this direction but its done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnishrun topattached kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow Thank you and happy whatsnowleftof2023 to you too  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data The spectrogram images are merely the icing on the cake they do not preserve enough of the relevant information adding some eye candy for the benefit of a broader audience As a guideline

here theres a central Virgo O3 angelprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961958345 dominating the scene corroborated by the 640 Hz peak frequency with a weather vaneprojectszooniversegravityspytalk7291890614 embedded slightly later This in itself is somewhat remarkable While such angelweather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O3 its the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll modeprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31962626575comment4297701 damper was disabled On a few dozen other occasions the 97 Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far This subject was recorded on 20190729 at some point between 032805815 and 032806 UTC And from a mere 0185 seconds later we have the overlapping continuation S50419949 of S50414860 now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around 65 Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane The interferometer stayed locked for another 8 seconds or so and lost lock at 032814 Science Mode was reestablished by 0356 The plots attached to the night shift reporthttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46507 show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isnt clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before 032805 and then simultaneous bumps in the

point tunedhttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46517 later on 20190729 implying it hadnt been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost We dont know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that havent been included among these plots were doing at the time I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be Its got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss I do have a few robust ideas what it cant be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots eg PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB2 needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range This was donehttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46510 a little later on 20190729 If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGOs DHARD and TX TY representing thetaX thetaY are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesnt have the PR2 PR3 folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others And it can open without the MetatronGuardianlevel automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more From the events of 20190715T193537 UTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46381 it cant be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see 50390322projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects50390322 from 20190713T215420 UTC elog 46355httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46355 Wherever theres a BNS range plot available around the time in question eg see again 20190715T193537 UTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor46381 weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on 20190713 when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 02 Mpc Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode A common feature of most of the prelockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions 10Hz or 95Hz or 97Hz oscillations which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damperprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31962626575comment4297701 When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on 20191206httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor47915 fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 194 Hz roll mode harmonics only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 20200314 So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day 20190729 when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see 5041486050419949projectszooniversegravityspytalk3282747909 In particular the loop were looking for is not that of the damper itself A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a pickedoff beam centered on a quadrant photodiode The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop The causal connections remain mysterious for now West End 97 Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop The relatively frequent weather vane angelprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961958345 combinations together with the run of angelwillow compound glitches from November 2019 and the fact that Willowsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk31961708892 are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injectioninput side of the interferometer But thats not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadnt been what triggered the subject What would this disturbance be classified as It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin  Well observed and a peculiar catch It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses shortduration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesnt want to fit into the available classes Weve embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class Youll find several relevant discussion threads eg in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass bliplet with an unusually abrupt transition from body to tail but Im not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the tail above it laughinglaughinglaughing and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow I wasnt sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but its the best classification I could find for it Thanks Nicm25 Im glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily Its interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next  Several scattered light among those Nicm25 Thanks for all your timestamps possiblenewglitch possiblenewglitch

    Now consider the following Talk data for differences:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst Maybe even a combination of glitches maybe scatteredlight Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time timestamp 20200223T183132 near time subject 40450211projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450211 according to I own

repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk762917436 and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these

part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicm25 has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450189 looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450234 looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450218 firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame

often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other

together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency

recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm25 The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nicm25 I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy

    This data is from the Gravity Spy forum, called "Talk" data. Gravity Spy is a citizen science project which classifies glitches which occur because of enviornmental effects or engineering issues related to gravitational wave sensors designed by LIGO. My primary interest is in observing emerging topics in the data. Particularly, it would be valuable to summarize major questions or discoveries in the talk data. For example, it is valuable to know if the citizen scientists are proposing new glitch classes. If they are proposing new glitch classes, what gives the citizen scientists this impression? Alternatively, if there are emerging questions related to LIGO sensors or gravitational wave science, this would also be good to know. Also, what are their particular questions? Finally, do they have any hypotheses about where glitches come from, this would also be good to know. If they have these, what are their hypotheses?

ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9FVDmcmXT9hFihhIOtSzuAEwcSUL2', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='From the Talk data provided, it appears that citizen scientists participating in the Gravity Spy project are actively engaged in identifying and classifying various types of glitches observed in data from LIGO gravitational wave sensors. Here are some key points observed from the conversations:\n\n1. **Proposing New Glitch Classes**: Citizen scientists are discussing and proposing new glitch classes based on the unique characteristics they observe in the data. For example, terms like "borderline varnish run blip" and "fireballkoi" are being used to describe specific types of glitches. This indicates that the volunteers are keen on categorizing and understanding the different types of anomalies present in the data.\n\n2. **Emerging Questions**: There are emerging questions related to the nature and origin of the glitches, such as whether a particular glitch is a scattered light glitch or a low-frequency burst, or if it could be a combination of different glitches. Additionally, there are discussions about the presence of repeating patterns like "repeating koi fishes" and the need to classify them.\n\n3. **Hypotheses about Glitch Origins**: Citizen scientists are formulating hypotheses about the origins of glitches based on their observations. For example, there are discussions about the causes of specific glitches like scattered light glitches, varnish run blips, and fireballkoi glitches. Hypotheses include factors such as vibrations, modifications to reduce vibrations, or specific environmental conditions affecting the sensors.\n\n4. **Discovery of New Patterns**: Volunteers are noting unique patterns in the glitches they observe, such as the presence of repeating blips, combinations of different glitch types, and irregularities in the characteristics of certain glitches. These observations lead to discussions about the classification and interpretation of these patterns.\n\nOverall, the Gravity Spy forum discussions reflect an active and engaged community of citizen scientists who are delving into the complexities of glitch classification, proposing new categories, and exploring hypotheses about the origins of these anomalies in the gravitational wave sensor data.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713481962, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_d9767fc5b9', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=391, prompt_tokens=12475, total_tokens=12866))

User Prompt: 
    Consider the following Talk data:
     This is an additional explanation I received Hope it helps From ZngabitanT Subject 40541004 Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a 4secondswide Gravity Spy subject 13741669 is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GW170817 It has been rendered at high Q453 which brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subjects fourth frame and which doesnt do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the 0 seconds mark A lowQ rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible The very loud glitch just before time 1 seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of 13741669 and were supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time 00 seconds or dominant at this time This is mentioned in the FAQprojectszooniversegravityspyaboutfaq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it In this way we help the Machine Learning to recognize eg a Whistle even when it is accompanied by Scattered Light or vice versa Thank you for contributing I have just finished my tertiary fly bliplets search and the above slightly chirpish bliplet came up with 3 others all at 6085Hz S35679038 S36194929 and S35945356 Just in case they are wanted for other collections  Grounded Koi Fish group followed by a medusa mechanical reverberations at about 48Hz recorded on 20200222 at 034616 UTC corresponding to a BNS range drop from 54Mpc down

droplet mackerel realm small blippy things sometimes chirpy sometimes slanting the other way with peak frequencies between 50 and 70 Hz is worth keeping apart from the bliplets peak frequencies below 50 Hz It is susceptible to modifications by the routine 60 Hz mains filtering by dark artefact bands aroud 60 Hz when there was a loud glitch nearby and occasionally even to glitches caused by hiccups in the 60 Hz mains although the latter fortunately have been rare during O3 Thank you I have a separate bliplet oddities collection where I can save these blippy things then I can delete the searches Back to raindrops next Deep joy  Something rendered at Q45 Fireballish LF burst  This must be agriculture and landscaping 20200116 around 0905 UTC Caused by something big and beefy  Mushrooms Thank you Thank you likewise koi at Q22 fireballkoi  Line of varying thickness at 22hz and whistle in frame 4 topattachedblip  bliplet at 38hz I said NOTA but it seems like there is a dim hfb around 063 s fireballkoi  bliplet at 40hz Either trumpetfishupperband or topattachedblip NOTA is certainly appropriate the offcenter HF feature cant be what triggered this subject The reported peak frequency of 97 Hz for the present S35412991 and its duplicate S35413459 together with the date and the fact that its from Hanford reveals it to be a rendering at lowerthanusual Q226 of Slow Parallelsprojectszooniversegravityspytal So the least nonobvious feature in frame 1 around 100 Hz for some 02 seconds is it Any parallels it may have had remain invisible under the random background noise at the low Q setting ZngabitanT Good to know thanks Certainly the feature around 100 Hz is more prominent than the hfb but I didnt know what to make of it Happy 2023 bliplet at 49hz hybrid line at 24hz and scattered light Repeating koi and fireballs fireballkoi  fireballkoi  fireballkoi  hfb plus a circular glitch with horns around 45hz fireballkoi  Or is it a tomte I will put it with the bliplets in any case Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the eiffel that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of baby Tomtes intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call lower frequency blips meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what weve been calling bliplets of late There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under 40 and just over 60 Hz mostly in the bins around 40 and 50 Hz where were finding the bliplets too Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3 Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between 20191113 and 20191122 But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples Ive also started doing a little in this direction but its done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnishrun topattached kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow Thank you and happy whatsnowlefto to you too  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data The spectrogram images are merely the icing on the cake they do not preserve enough of the relevant information adding some eye candy for the benefit

broken line WOW Massive koifireballs eiffel Nice overlapping pair here showing the effect of the different Qvalue choices Among the rather noisy mess here theres a central Virgo O3 angelprojectszooniversegravityspytal dominating the scene corroborated by the 640 Hz peak frequency with a weather vaneprojectszooniversegravityspytal embedded slightly later This in itself is somewhat remarkable While such angelweather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O3 its the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll modeprojectszooniversegravityspytalcommen damper was disabled On a few dozen other occasions the 97 Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far This subject was recorded on 20190729 at some point between 032805815 and 032806 UTC And from a mere 0185 seconds later we have the overlapping continuation S50419949 of S50414860 now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around 65 Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane The interferometer stayed locked for another 8 seconds or so and lost lock at 032814 Science Mode was reestablished by 0356 The plots attached to the night shift reporthttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgo show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isnt clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before 032805 and then simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at 032813 and then the IMC lock dropped plots around the 20190729T032814 locklosshttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgouploadplopnghttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgouploadplopng One of the ASC loops in question had its set point tunedhttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgo later on 20190729 implying it hadnt been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost We dont know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that havent been included among these plots were doing at the time I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be Its got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss I do have a few robust ideas what it cant be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots eg PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB2 needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range This was donehttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgo a little later on 20190729 If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGOs DHARD and TX TY representing thetaX thetaY are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesnt have the PR2 PR3 folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others And it can open without the MetatronGuardianlevel automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more From the events of 20190715T193537 UTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgo it cant be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see 50390322projectszooniversegravityspytalksubject from 20190713T215420 UTC elog 46355httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgo Wherever theres a BNS range plot available around the time in question eg see again 20190715T193537 UTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgo weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on 20190713 when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 02 Mpc Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode A common feature of most of the prelockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions 10Hz or 95Hz or 97Hz oscillations which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damperprojectszooniversegravityspytalcommen When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on 20191206httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgo fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 194 Hz roll mode harmonics only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 20200314 So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day 20190729 when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see 5041486050419949projectszooniversegravityspytal In particular the loop were looking for is not that of the damper itself A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a pickedoff beam centered on a quadrant photodiode The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop The causal connections remain mysterious for now West End 97 Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop The relatively frequent weather vane angelprojectszooniversegravityspytal combinations together with the run of angelwillow compound glitches from November 2019 and the fact that Willowsprojectszooniversegravityspytal are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injectioninput side of the interferometer But thats not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadnt been what triggered the subject What would this disturbance be classified as It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin  Well observed and a peculiar catch It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses shortduration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesnt want to fit into the available classes Weve embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class Youll find several relevant discussion threads eg in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytal The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass bliplet with an unusually abrupt transition from body to tail but Im not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the tail above it laughinglaughinglaughing and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow I wasnt sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but its the best classification I could find for it Thanks Nic Im glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily Its interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next  Several scattered light among those Nic Thanks for all your timestamps possiblenewglitch possiblenewglitch

    Now consider the following Talk data for differences:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst Maybe even a combination of glitches maybe scatteredlight Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light I think it was after

the repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytal and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these glitches that isnt well understood yet Youre very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and

part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nic has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubject looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubject looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubject firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame 4httpsthumbnailszooniverseorpanoptesuploadszooniverseorgsubjectlocatioeeepngprojectszooniversegravityspytalksubject Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches the keystones or capstones if you wish are bright 50347545 frame 4httpsthumbnailszooniverseorpanoptesuploadszooniverseorgsubjectlocationbbpngprojectszooniversegravityspytalksubject Rows of arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other 51184337 frame 4httpsthumbnailszooniverseorpanoptesuploadszooniverseorgsubjectlocatioapngprojectszooniversegravityspytalksubject And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening 50324234 frame 4httpsthumbnailszooniverseorpanoptesuploadszooniverseorgsubjectlocatioefaapngprojectszooniversegravityspytalksubject Putting all these possibilities together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close

present subject are a lowQ rendering of Scattered Light as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nic The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nic I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy whistle in frame 1 and a combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4 bliplet at 32hz boudin Possible chirp at 035 483 Hz fireballkoi  coronet bliplet at 40 Hz trumpetfishmiddleband  Yes it looks like there are two kois maybe three with fireballs hybrid LFB and coronet whistle and maybe fireballs in frame 4 bliplet at 40hz topattachedblip  Repeating koi with fireballs ZngabitanT This one doesnt quite make it to 2048 Hz Would it qualify as borderline varnish run blip I see the 60hz line here perhaps ground current from a suddenly earthed outlet piezo electricelectromagnetic electric fieldmagnetic field disturbance  Thank you  I chose Blip mirrored wave koifish is a very broad term forgive the pun  the universe was doing stuff like this all that time ago raises eyebrow This is an interesting double whistle When classifying as usual I probably would have chosed Low Frequency Line but root cause appeared to be scatteredlight even before fix low frequency scatteredlight appeared in the previous and next subjects Next subject neighbor was also scattered light timestamp 20190621T003541 near time

Nice catch I would file this under Blip subclass blip an ordinary one running out of steam before reaching the 2048 Hz edge It does however serve as an example of how close to the varnish run border the ordinary variety can come Apropos of this a headsup This subject is part of a quintuplet S38042973 S38044831 S38047269 S38049321 In my own Blip subclass collections Im making an effort to pick up only the lowestnumbered subject when there are identical duplicates in order to keep them representative of the true timeline distribution You may wish to do the same  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and pretty catch The features around 60 Hz are the fins of the Koi Fish glitch not a separate glitch superimposed on it Very loud shortduration glitches interact with the filtering that suppresses the everpresent 60 Hz mains noise producing those finlike artefacts Glitches caused by electrical mains disturbances have been quite rare during the third observing run at the LIGO sites Thank you for contributing Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk Yes sometimes there have been whistle duets and occasionally even larger ensembles Thank you for contributing Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and curious catch Yes I agree Koi Fish often come in the company of additional glitches but this here is a rare sort and Im not quite sure what it would look like on its own For classification purposes though the central Koi Fish glitch takes precedence Thank you for contributing Which one of ten is this graph Its neither low frequency burst nor scattered light Other variants are not fit this graph I think that it can be crown but I have only the third level therefore I cant choose this variant As a compromise I chose None of the Above  Not sure what to make of this Scattered light plus Q22 A lot of artefacts I wonder what was nearby 1777Hz 20191116 around 2042 UTC  Scattered light plus something faint and almost vertical  49393Hz 20200323 around 0412 UTC I have got a bit out of practice with these horizontal subjects too busy with the dear little bliplet gang  If this was O3 I wouid say agriculture and landscaping but it isnt Lf bursts  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and well observed None Of The Above is the right choice in such cases This is indeed a Crown a glitch class that was originally discovered by Gravity Spy contributors and added to levels 5 and 7 in 2019 Others had been reminded of sparrows on a wire of paw prints and more See the Field Guide and the original glitch class proposal threadprojectszooniversegravityspytal for more information and examples At levels 14 they can be classified as None Of The Above but you can already make a collection of them and study their variability None Of The Above classifications in levels 14 will help to advance such subjects towards level 5 where they can be classified properly maybe even by your own future self Thank you for contributing Good catch What was nearby was already lingering in one of my many queues lets pull it out for the record the present subject is from 20191116T203827 UTC  heres a higherQ view of the continuation of S50332387 over the next second with increasing artefacts 20191116T203828 UTC Since timestamps as stored in the Gravity Spy tools are always truncated to the full second the actual time difference between the two could be anywhere between a few milliseconds and just under 2 seconds in this case probably closer to the latter ie S50332402 may have been recorded just before 203829 And then shortly after S50332387 and S50332402 the interferometer lost lock for reasons that werent worked out at the time but the weather was bad with much wind and ground motion and flood waters running down from the mountains The present S50332736 is from 20191116T203840 UTC The actual lockloss would have happened a few seconds later but the shift reporthttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgo only gives the whole minute and has no detailed plot attached The ample noise we see here isnt what actually killed the lock its a byproduct of suddenly missing data after the lockloss This can upset and spoil the preprocessing of up to a whole minutes worth of data during the creation of our spectrograms Thank you always interesting to see the shift reports not that I can understand most of them Also the contrasting q values 

    This data is from the Gravity Spy forum, called "Talk" data. Gravity Spy is a citizen science project which classifies glitches which occur because of enviornmental effects or engineering issues related to gravitational wave sensors designed by LIGO. My primary interest is in observing emerging topics in the data. Particularly, it would be valuable to summarize major questions or discoveries in the talk data. For example, it is valuable to know if the citizen scientists are proposing new glitch classes. If they are proposing new glitch classes, what gives the citizen scientists this impression? Alternatively, if there are emerging questions related to LIGO sensors or gravitational wave science, this would also be good to know. Also, what are their particular questions? Finally, do they have any hypotheses about where glitches come from, this would also be good to know. If they have these, what are their hypotheses?

Here are some key points:\n\n1. **New Glitch Class Proposals**: \n   - There are discussions about proposing new glitch classes such as "borderline varnish run blip" and "crown glitches" based on unique characteristics observed in the data. Citizen scientists are actively categorizing and analyzing glitches to identify distinct patterns and features that may warrant new classifications.\n\n2. **Emerging Questions**:\n   - There are questions about the nature and origins of specific glitches, such as whether certain features are related to scattered light or low-frequency bursts, and how modifications to reduce vibrations may affect the appearance of glitches. Citizen scientists are curious about the complex interplay of environmental factors and engineering adjustments on the sensor data.\n\n3. **Hypotheses about Glitch Origins**:\n   - There are hypotheses being discussed regarding the potential sources of glitches, such as vibrations from ground currents, electrical disturbances, or even natural events like wind and floodwaters affecting the sensors. Citizen scientists are exploring various possibilities and trying to understand the causal relationships behind different types of glitches.\n\n4. **Focus on Specific Glitch Characteristics**:\n   - There is attention to specific glitch characteristics, including variations in energy levels, frequency patterns, and visual appearances of glitches like crowns, blips, scattered light, and varnish run blips. Citizen scientists are actively analyzing the data to identify recurring patterns and anomalies.\n\nOverall, the Gravity Spy community is engaged in detailed analysis and interpretation of the sensor data, proposing new glitch classes, asking insightful questions, and developing hypotheses to better understand the origin and nature of the glitches observed in the LIGO sensors.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713482519, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_d9767fc5b9', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=362, prompt_tokens=13481, total_tokens=13843))

User Prompt: 
    Consider the following Talk data:
     This is an additional explanation I received Hope it helps From ZngabitanT Subject Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a 4secondswide Gravity Spy subject is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GWIt has been rendered at high Qwhich brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subjects fourth frame and which doesnt do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the seconds mark A lowQ rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible The very loud glitch just before time seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of and were supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time seconds or dominant at this time This is mentioned in the FAQprojectszooniversegravityspyaboutfaq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it In this way we help the Machine Learning to recognize eg a Whistle even when it is accompanied by Scattered Light or vice versa Thank you for contributing I have just finished my tertiary fly bliplets search and the above slightly chirpish bliplet came up with others all at 6085Hz SSand S Just in case they are wanted for other collections  Grounded Koi Fish group followed by a medusa mechanical

the droplet mackerel realm small blippy things sometimes chirpy sometimes slanting the other way with peak frequencies between and Hz is worth keeping apart from the bliplets peak frequencies below Hz It is susceptible to modifications by the routine Hz mains filtering by dark artefact bands aroud Hz when there was a loud glitch nearby and occasionally even to glitches caused by hiccups in the Hz mains although the latter fortunately have been rare during O3 Thank you I have a separate bliplet oddities collection where I can save these blippy things then I can delete the searches Back to raindrops next Deep joy  Something rendered at Q Fireballish LF burst  This must be agriculture and landscaping around UTC Caused by something big and beefy  Mushrooms Thank you Thank you likewise koi

Either trumpetfishupperband or topattachedblip NOTA is certainly appropriate the offcenter HF feature cant be what triggered this subject The reported peak frequency of Hz for the present Sand its duplicate Stogether with the date and the fact that its from Hanford reveals it to be a rendering at lowerthanusual Qof Slow ParallelsprojectszooniversegravityspytalkSo the least nonobvious feature in frame around Hz for some seconds is it Any parallels it may have had remain invisible under the random background noise at the low Q setting ZngabitanT Good to know thanks Certainly the feature around Hz is more prominent than the hfb but I didnt know what to make of it Happy 2023 bliplet at 49hz hybrid line at 24hz and scattered light Repeating koi and fireballs fireballkoi  fireballkoi  fireballkoi  hfb plus a circular glitch with horns around 45hz fireballkoi  Or is it a tomte I will put it with the bliplets in any case Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the eiffel that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of baby Tomtes intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call lower frequency blips meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what weve been calling bliplets of late There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under and just over Hz mostly in the bins around and Hz where were finding the bliplets too Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during OHanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between and But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples Ive also started doing a little in this direction but its done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnishrun topattached kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow Thank you and happy whatsnowleftofto you too  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data The spectrogram images are merely the icing on the cake they do not preserve enough of the

both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo Oits the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll

The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far This subject was recorded on at some point between and UTC And from a mere seconds later we have the overlapping continuation Sof Snow

hadnt been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost We dont know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that havent been included among these plots were doing at the time I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be Its got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss I do have a few robust ideas what it cant be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots eg PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDBneeded adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range This was donehttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgora little later on 20190729 If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGOs DHARD and TX TY representing thetaX thetaY are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesnt have the PRPRfolding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others And it can open without the MetatronGuardianlevel automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more From the events of 20190715TUTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgorit cant be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see 50390322projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjectsfrom 20190713TUTC elog 46355httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgor Wherever theres a BNS range plot available around the time in question eg see again 20190715TUTC and elog 46381httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgorweather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to Mpc Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode A common feature of most of the prelockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions 10Hz or 95Hz or 97Hz oscillations which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damperprojectszooniversegravityspytalcommentWhen the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on 20191206httpslogbookvirgogweuvirgorfixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the Hz roll mode harmonics only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see 5041486050419949projectszooniversegravityspytalkIn particular the loop were looking for is not that of the damper itself A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a pickedoff beam centered on a quadrant photodiode The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop The causal connections remain mysterious for now West End Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop The relatively frequent weather vane angelprojectszooniversegravityspytalkcombinations together with the run of angelwillow compound glitches from November and the fact that Willowsprojectszooniversegravityspytalkare known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injectioninput side of the interferometer But thats not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadnt been what triggered the subject What would this disturbance be classified as It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin  Well observed and a peculiar catch It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses shortduration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesnt want to fit into the available classes Weve embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class Youll find several relevant discussion threads eg in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass bliplet with an unusually abrupt transition from body to tail but Im not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the tail above it laughinglaughinglaughing and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which Im thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow I wasnt sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but its the best classification I could find for it Thanks NicmIm glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily Its interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next  Several scattered light among those Nicm Thanks for all your timestamps possiblenewglitch possiblenewglitch

    Now consider the following Talk data for differences:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst Maybe even a combination of glitches maybe scatteredlight Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light I think it was after

Theres a repeating blip class What about the repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalkand could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these glitches that isnt well understood yet Youre very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing

regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organprojectszooniversegravityspycollectionszngabitantloudblipgroupsymmetricwithkoigrandorgan Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicmhas extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjectslooking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjectslooking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjectsfirmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to at Hanford and prior to at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at for the faintest background level to bright yellow at for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around and around Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo Oand yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to kHz for more than seconds although peaking at Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for results from Virgo era Oproduces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer frame 4httpsthumbnailszooniverseorpanoptesuploadszooniverseorgsubjectlocatioeeepngprojectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches the keystones or capstones if you wish are bright frame 4httpsthumbnailszooniverseorpanoptesuploadszooniverseorgsubjectlocationbbpngprojectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects Rows of arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other frame 4httpsthumbnailszooniverseorpanoptesuploadszooniverseorgsubjectlocatioapngprojectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening frame 4httpsthumbnailszooniverseorpanoptesuploadszooniverseorgsubjectlocatioefaapngprojectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects Putting all these possibilities together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during OVirgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo OScattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close

are a lowQ rendering of Scattered Light as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet NicmI dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Qin frames and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy whistle in frame and a combination of whistle and drizzle in frames and 4 bliplet at 32hz boudin Possible chirp at 035 Hz fireballkoi

running out of steam before reaching the Hz edge It does however serve as an example of how close to the varnish run border the ordinary variety can come Apropos of this a headsup This subject is part of a quintuplet S S S SIn my own Blip subclass collections Im making an effort to pick up only the lowestnumbered subject when there are identical duplicates in order to keep them representative of the true timeline distribution You may wish to do the same  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and pretty catch The features around Hz are the fins of the Koi Fish glitch not a separate glitch superimposed on it Very loud shortduration glitches interact with the filtering that suppresses the everpresent Hz mains noise producing those finlike artefacts Glitches caused by electrical mains disturbances have been quite rare during the third observing run at the LIGO sites Thank you for contributing Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk Yes sometimes there have been whistle duets and occasionally even larger ensembles Thank you for contributing Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and curious catch Yes I agree Koi Fish often come in the company of additional glitches but this here is a rare sort and Im not quite sure what it would look like on its own For classification purposes though the central Koi Fish glitch takes precedence Thank you for contributing Which one of ten is this graph Its neither low frequency burst nor scattered light Other variants are not fit this graph I think that it can be crown but I have only the third level therefore I cant choose this variant As a compromise I chose None of the Above  Not sure what to make of this Scattered light plus Q22 A lot of artefacts I wonder what was nearby 1777Hz around UTC  Scattered light plus something faint and almost vertical  49393Hz around UTC I have got a bit out of practice with these horizontal subjects too busy with the dear little bliplet gang  If this was OI wouid say agriculture and landscaping but it isnt Lf bursts  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and well observed None Of The Above is the right choice in such cases This is indeed a Crown a glitch class that was originally discovered by Gravity Spy contributors and added to levels and in Others had been reminded of sparrows on a wire of paw prints and more See the Field Guide and the original glitch class proposal threadprojectszooniversegravityspytalkfor more information and examples At levels they can be classified as None Of The Above but you can already make a collection of them and study their variability None Of The Above classifications in levels will help to advance such subjects towards level where they can be classified properly maybe even by your own future self Thank you for contributing Good catch What was nearby was already lingering in one of my many queues lets pull it out for the record the present subject is from 20191116TUTC  heres a higherQ view of the continuation of Sover the next second with increasing artefacts 20191116TUTC Since timestamps as stored in the Gravity Spy tools are always truncated to the full second the actual time difference between the two could be anywhere between a few milliseconds and just under seconds in this case probably closer to the latter ie Smay have been recorded just before And then shortly after Sand Sthe interferometer lost lock for reasons that werent worked out at the time but the weather was bad with much wind and ground motion and flood waters running down from the mountains The present Sis from 20191116TUTC The actual lockloss would have happened a few seconds later but the shift reporthttpslogbookvirgogweuvirgoronly gives the whole minute and has no detailed plot attached The ample noise we see here isnt what actually killed the lock its a byproduct of suddenly missing data after the lockloss This can upset and spoil the preprocessing of up to a whole minutes worth of data during the creation of our spectrograms Thank you always interesting to see the shift reports not that I can understand most of them Also the contrasting q values 

    This data is from the Gravity Spy forum, called "Talk" data. Gravity Spy is a citizen science project which classifies glitches which occur because of enviornmental effects or engineering issues related to gravitational wave sensors designed by LIGO. My primary interest is in observing emerging topics in the data. Particularly, it would be valuable to summarize major questions or discoveries in the talk data. For example, it is valuable to know if the citizen scientists are proposing new glitch classes. If they are proposing new glitch classes, what gives the citizen scientists this impression? Alternatively, if there are emerging questions related to LIGO sensors or gravitational wave science, this would also be good to know. Also, what are their particular questions? Finally, do they have any hypotheses about where glitches come from, this would also be good to know. If they have these, what are their hypotheses?
    
GRAVITYBOT RESPONSE:
ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9FVQrP5VESdbl4tlxxCLuuMuyH5YR', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='The forum discussions in the Gravity Spy data reveal several interesting points and questions raised by the citizen scientists:\n\n1. **New Glitch Classes:** Citizen scientists are actively proposing new glitch classes based on their observations of the data. For example, they have identified variations in the characteristics of glitches that do not neatly fit into existing classifications. The emergence of these new glitch classes suggests a need for further refinement and expansion of the classification system to capture the diverse nature of glitches observed in the data.\n\n2. **Impressions Leading to Proposed Classes:** Citizen scientists are forming impressions based on the unique features of glitches they encounter. These impressions likely stem from patterns or anomalies in the data that deviate from known glitch types. By highlighting these unusual characteristics, citizen scientists are prompting discussions and investigations into potentially novel glitch classes that may enhance the understanding of the data.\n\n3. **Emerging Questions:** There are emerging questions related to the LIGO sensors and gravitational wave science within the Gravity Spy forum discussions. Some of these questions may revolve around the origins of specific glitches, the impact of environmental factors on sensor readings, or the effectiveness of engineering modifications in reducing unwanted vibrations or artifacts in the data. These questions reflect a curiosity and eagerness to delve deeper into the complexities of gravitational wave detection.\n\n4. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins:** Citizen scientists are formulating hypotheses about the origins of glitches observed in the data. These hypotheses may be based on trends or correlations in the occurrence of certain types of glitches, environmental conditions during data collection, or the effects of sensor adjustments on glitch patterns. By exploring various hypotheses, citizen scientists are contributing to the ongoing scientific inquiry into the nature of glitches and their underlying causes.\n\nOverall, the Gravity Spy forum discussions showcase a collaborative effort to analyze and understand the intricate nature of glitches in gravitational wave sensor data. The exploration of new glitch classes, the posing of insightful questions, and the development of hypotheses demonstrate the active engagement and inquisitiveness of citizen scientists in unraveling the mysteries of gravitational wave detection.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713482773, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_d9767fc5b9', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=405, prompt_tokens=12180, total_tokens=12585))

User Prompt: 
    Consider the following Talk data:
     This is an additional explanation I received Hope it helps From ZngabitanT Subject Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a seconds wide Gravity Spy subject is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GW It has been rendered at high Q which brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subject s fourth frame and which doesn t do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the seconds mark A low Q rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible The very loud glitch just before time seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of and we re supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time seconds or dominant at this time This is mentioned in the FAQ projects zooniverse gravity spy about faq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it In this way we help the Machine Learning to recognize e g a Whistle even when it is accompanied by Scattered Light or vice versa Thank you for contributing  I have just finished my

usual Q of Slow Parallels projects zooniverse gravity spy talk So the least non obvious feature in frame around Hz for some seconds is it Any parallels it may have had remain invisible under the random background noise at the low Q setting   ZngabitanT Good to know thanks Certainly the feature around Hz is more prominent than the hfb but I didn t know what to make of it Happy   bliplet at

tomte I will put it with the bliplets in any case Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the eiffel that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of baby Tomtes intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call lower frequency blips meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what we ve been calling bliplets of late There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under and just over Hz mostly in the bins around and Hz where we re finding the bliplets too Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between and But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples I ve also started doing a little in this direction but it s done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnish run top attached kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which I m thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow  Thank you and happy what s now left of to you too  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned

noisy mess here there s a central Virgo O angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk dominating the scene corroborated by the Hz peak frequency with a weather vane projects zooniverse gravity spy talk embedded slightly later This in itself is somewhat remarkable While such angel weather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O it s the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll mode projects zooniverse gravity spy talk comment damper was disabled On a few dozen other occasions the Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far This subject was recorded on at some point between and UTC And from a mere seconds later we have   the overlapping continuation S of S now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane The interferometer stayed locked for another seconds or so and lost lock at Science Mode was reestablished by The plots attached to the night shift report https logbook virgo

simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at and then the IMC lock dropped plots around the 29T lockloss https logbook virgo gw eu virgo uploads plot png https logbook virgo gw eu virgo uploads plot png One of the ASC loops in question had its set point tuned https logbook virgo gw eu virgo r later on implying it hadn t been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost We don t know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that haven t been included among these plots were doing at the time I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be It s got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss I do have a few robust ideas what it can t be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots e g PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range This was done https logbook virgo gw

corresponds to LIGO s DHARD and TX TY representing theta X theta Y are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesn t have the PR PR folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta  Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others And it can open without the Metatron Guardian level automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more From the events of 15T UTC and elog https logbook virgo gw eu virgo r it can t be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see projects zooniverse gravity spy talk subjects from 13T UTC elog https logbook virgo gw eu virgo r Wherever there s a BNS range plot available around the time in question e g see again 15T UTC and elog https logbook virgo gw eu virgo r weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to Mpc Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode A common feature of most of the pre lockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions 10Hz or 5Hz or 7Hz oscillations which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damper projects zooniverse gravity spy talk comment When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on https logbook virgo gw eu virgo r fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the Hz roll mode harmonics only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see projects zooniverse gravity spy talk In particular the loop we re looking for is not that of the damper itself A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a picked off beam centered on a quadrant photodiode The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop The causal connections remain mysterious for now West End Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop The relatively frequent weather vane angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk combinations together with the run of angel willow compound glitches from November and the fact that Willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injection input side of the interferometer But that s not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadn t been what triggered the subject  What would this disturbance be classified as It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin  Well observed and a peculiar catch It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses short duration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesn t want to fit into the available classes We ve embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class You ll find several relevant discussion threads e g in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass bliplet with an unusually abrupt transition from body to tail but I m not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the tail above it   laughing laughing laughing and the sardines and the sardines rare cousins which I m thinking of as anchovies so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow I wasn t sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but it s the best classification I could find for it  Thanks Nicm I m glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily  It s interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next  Several scattered light among those   Nicm Thanks for all your timestamps   possiblenewglitch  possiblenewglitch

    Now consider the following Talk data for differences:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst Maybe even a combination of glitches  maybe scatteredlight Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light I think it was after

about the repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  That s right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when it s recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballs projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these glitches that isn t well understood yet You re very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further

organ projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant loud blip group symmetric with koi grand organ  Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance I m never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but that s not yet etched in stone  Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole five minute run that Nicm has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like projects zooniverse gravity spy talk subjects looking more like the former others like projects zooniverse gravity spy talk subjects looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy tools https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like projects zooniverse gravity spy talk subjects firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to at Hanford and prior to at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions aren t as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesn t vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also don t involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they aren t the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the different hues used to represent the noise energy levels from dark violet at for the faintest background level to bright yellow at for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level instead of brighter than uhm that not very bright shade of turquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential arm length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale that s the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing  Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesn t curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three near simultaneous small sort of blips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around and around Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years I ve seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search  21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesn t seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created it s own subject  Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O and yes these can sometimes fail to look very arch like I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to kHz for more than seconds although peaking at Hz that s long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity search https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search asking for results from Virgo era O produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two well developed little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 0221 b 107d 46ee 859e e e png projects zooniverse gravity spy talk subjects Another one where only the

arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO s though not as rapid as LIGO s Crowns  Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency causes optical

gravity spy talk subjects  The low frequency features in the present subject are a low Q rendering of Scattered Light as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm The two kinds of glitches are not causally related  This is the second one of these that I get I guess there s not a hashtag for these blips yet   Nicm I don t recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one  Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q   blip plus what looks like crowns at Q in frames and  This seems like it could be a Koi and something else  No there s no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that we ve more recently been talking about as top attached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus I m rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they aren t so easy to mis spell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags can t be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips   bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip   fireball koi   fireball koi  Oh I m sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you ve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I haven t started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So there s a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful   bliplet at 49hz So top attached blips are blips that are yellow all the way to the Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy whistle in frame and a combination of whistle and drizzle in frames and   bliplet at 32hz  boudin Possible chirp at 35  Hz  fireball koi   coronet  bliplet at Hz  trumpetfish middle band  Yes it looks like there are two kois maybe three with fireballs   hybrid LFB and coronet   whistle and maybe fireballs in frame   bliplet at 40hz  top attached blip  Repeating koi with fireballs  ZngabitanT This one doesn t quite make it to Hz Would it qualify as borderline varnish run blip  I see the 60hz line here perhaps ground current from a suddenly earthed outlet piezo electric electromagnetic electric field magnetic field disturbance  Thank you  I chose Blip  mirrored wave koifish is a very broad term forgive the pun  the universe was doing stuff like this all that time ago raises eyebrow This is an interesting double whistle  When classifying as usual I probably would have chosed Low Frequency Line but root cause appeared to be scatteredlight even before fix low frequency scatteredlight appeared in the previous and next

how close to the varnish run border the ordinary variety can come Apropos of this a heads up This subject is part of a quintuplet S S S S In my own Blip subclass collections I m making an effort to pick up only the lowest numbered subject when there are identical duplicates in order to keep them representative of the true timeline distribution You may wish to do the same  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and pretty catch The features around Hz are the fins of the Koi Fish glitch not a separate glitch superimposed on it Very loud short duration glitches interact with the filtering that suppresses the ever present Hz mains noise producing those fin like artefacts Glitches caused by electrical mains disturbances have been quite rare during the third observing run at the LIGO sites Thank you for contributing  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk Yes sometimes there have been whistle duets and occasionally even larger ensembles Thank you for contributing  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and curious catch Yes I agree Koi Fish often come in the company of additional glitches but this here is a rare sort and I m not quite sure what it would look like on its own For classification purposes though the central Koi Fish glitch takes precedence Thank you for contributing  Which one of ten is this graph It s neither low frequency burst nor scattered light Other variants are not fit this graph I think that it can be crown but I have only the third level therefore I can t choose this variant As a compromise I chose None of the Above  Not sure what to make of this Scattered light plus Q22 A lot of artefacts I wonder what was nearby 77Hz around UTC  Scattered light plus something faint and almost vertical   93Hz around UTC I have got a bit out of practice with these horizontal subjects too busy with the dear little bliplet gang  If this was O I wouid say agriculture and landscaping but it isn t Lf bursts  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and well observed None Of The Above is the right choice in such cases This is indeed a Crown a glitch class that was originally discovered by Gravity Spy contributors and added to levels and in Others had been reminded of sparrows on a wire of paw prints and more See the Field Guide and the original glitch class proposal thread projects zooniverse gravity spy talk for more information and examples At levels they can be classified as None Of The Above but you can already make a collection of them and study their variability None Of The Above classifications in levels will help to advance such subjects towards level where they can be classified properly maybe even by your own future self Thank you for contributing  Good catch What was nearby was already lingering in one of my many queues let s pull it out for the record the present subject is from 16T UTC   here s a higher Q view of the continuation of S over the next second with increasing artefacts 16T UTC Since timestamps as stored in the Gravity Spy tools are always truncated to the full second the actual time difference between the two could be anywhere between a few milliseconds and just under seconds in this case probably closer to the latter i e S may have been recorded just before And then   shortly after S and S the interferometer lost lock for reasons that weren t worked out at the time but the weather was bad with much wind and ground motion and flood waters running down from the mountains The present S is from 16T UTC The actual lockloss would have happened a few seconds later but the shift report https logbook virgo gw eu virgo r only gives the whole minute and has no detailed plot attached The ample noise we see here isn t what actually killed the lock it s a byproduct of suddenly missing data after the lockloss This can upset and spoil the pre processing of up to a whole minute s worth of data during the creation of our spectrograms  Thank you always interesting to see the shift reports not that I can understand most of them Also the contrasting q

    This data is from the Gravity Spy forum, called "Talk" data. Gravity Spy is a citizen science project which classifies glitches which occur because of enviornmental effects or engineering issues related to gravitational wave sensors designed by LIGO. My primary interest is in observing emerging topics in the data. Particularly, it would be valuable to summarize major questions or discoveries in the talk data. For example, it is valuable to know if the citizen scientists are proposing new glitch classes. If they are proposing new glitch classes, what gives the citizen scientists this impression? Alternatively, if there are emerging questions related to LIGO sensors or gravitational wave science, this would also be good to know. Also, what are their particular questions? Finally, do they have any hypotheses about where glitches come from, this would also be good to know. If they have these, what are their hypotheses?

User Prompt: 
    Consider the following Talk data:
     This is an additional explanation I received. Hope it helps. From ZngabitanT Subject Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a seconds wide Gravity Spy subject. is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GW170817. It has been rendered at high Q 45. which brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subject's fourth frame and which doesn't do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the seconds mark. A low Q rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible. The very loud glitch just before time seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis. It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data. For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of and we're supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp.  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time 0. seconds or dominant at this time. This is mentioned in the FAQ projects zooniverse gravity spy about faq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it. In this way we help the Machine Learning to recognize e.g. a Whistle even when it is accompanied by Scattered Light or vice versa. Thank you for contributing!

So the "least non obvious" feature in frame around Hz for some 0. seconds is "it" . Any parallels it may have had remain invisible under the random background noise at the low Q setting.

I will put it with the bliplets in any case. Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the 'eiffel' that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction. I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed? ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of "baby Tomtes" intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets... and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call "lower frequency blips" meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what we've been calling "bliplets" of late . There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under and just over Hz mostly in the bins around and Hz where we're finding the bliplets too. Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3. Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between and 22. But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets. So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples! I've also started doing a little in this direction but it's done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnish run "top attached" kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow.  Thank you and happy what's now left of to you too!  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams. Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data . The spectrogram images are merely the icing on the cake they do not preserve enough of the relevant information adding some "eye candy" for the benefit of a broader audience.

Massive koi fireballs eiffel Nice overlapping pair here showing the effect of the different Q value choices... Among the rather noisy mess here there's a central Virgo O angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk dominating the scene corroborated by the Hz peak frequency with a weather vane projects zooniverse gravity spy talk embedded slightly later. This in itself is somewhat remarkable. While such angel weather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O it's the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll mode projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment damper was disabled . On a few dozen other occasions the 9. Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch. The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far. This subject was recorded on at some point between 05. and UTC. And from a mere 0. seconds later we have... ...the overlapping continuation S of S now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane. The interferometer stayed locked for another seconds or so and lost lock at 14. Science Mode was reestablished by 56. The plots attached to the night shift report https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isn't clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before and then simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at and then the IMC lock dropped. ! plots around the 29T lockloss https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png One of the ASC loops in question had its set point tuned https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r later on implying it hadn't been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost . We don't know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that haven't been included among these plots were doing at the time. I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be. It's got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss... I do have a few robust ideas what it can't be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots e.g. PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis. The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range. This was done https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r a little later on 29.  If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGO's DHARD and TX TY representing theta X theta Y are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively. Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT. MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesn't have the PR PR folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta .  Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further. There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later. It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook . Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop. The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others . And it can open without the Metatron Guardian level automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more . From the events of 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r it can't be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches. The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see from 13T UTC elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r . Wherever there's a BNS range plot available around the time in question e.g. see again 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last. But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 0. Mpc. Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode. A common feature of most of the pre lockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions "10Hz" or "9.5Hz" or "9.7Hz" oscillations... which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damper projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment . When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 19. Hz roll mode harmonics... only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 14. So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . In particular the loop we're looking for is not that of the damper itself. A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a picked off beam centered on a quadrant photodiode. The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop. The causal connections remain mysterious for now. West End 9. Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop. The relatively frequent weather vane angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk combinations together with the run of angel willow compound glitches from November and the fact that Willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injection input side of the interferometer. But that's not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too. By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadn't been what triggered the subject... What would this disturbance be classified as? It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin.  Well observed and a peculiar catch! It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses short duration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown. Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes. We've embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class. You'll find several relevant discussion threads e.g. in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass "bliplet" with an unusually abrupt transition from "body" to "tail" but I'm not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the "tail" above it.  laughing laughing laughing "and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow." I wasn't sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but it's the best classification I could find for it. Thanks Nicm I'm glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily! It's interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next.  Several scattered light among those.

The glitch free picture is impressive but Not as a new GS logo! Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk celticlord and thank you for contributing! This subject and the others that Nicm has kindly pulled out of the database are among the last loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches from the third observing run. A fix was applied later the same day at Livingston and one week later at Hanford which successfully got rid of them. And then the engineers used Gravity Spy data to validate that their fix was effective. Certainly so Brian.

CPwoSQP z  What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips. There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when it's recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud. Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballs projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet. You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk ! For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now Hanford Fireballish with koi https www.zooniverse.org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny hanford fireballish with koi Livingston Fireballish with koi https www.zooniverse.org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny livingston fireballish with koi to be compared with H Fireballish no koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny fireballish no koi L Fireballish no koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny fireballish no koi while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organ projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant loud blip group symmetric with koi grand organ  Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run "flowing down" from beyond the top edge . At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch and good question! The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole five minute run that Nicm has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like looking more like the former others like looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy tools https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like firmly on the LFB side. But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to at Hanford and prior to at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses. Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also don't involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question! The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count in steps of ten the different hues used to represent the noise energy levels from dark violet at for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25. for the most energetic parts of the glitch. These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than uhm that not very bright shade of turquoise". In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential arm length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy. Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. It probably originated as a compound of two or three near simultaneous small sort of blips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around and around Hz. Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search . 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end. Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes this is Scattered Light " la Virgo O3" and yes these can sometimes fail to look very arch like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to kHz for more than seconds although peaking at 21. Hz that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject. Running this through a similarity search https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search asking for results from Virgo era O produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well developed little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 0221 b 107d 46ee 859e e .png Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish are bright ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location f f 437b bc 5 .png Rows of arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 3b c 4 f 99e 22274071545a.png And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 2245 e 4 e fd 0 a a .png Putting all these possibilities together we may arrive at cases like the present subject. On a few rare occasions during O Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns . Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency causes optical resonance as glitches. timestamp 19T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page Livingston no recorded as glitches H1O3a 19T 38.

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet?  Nicm I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q.  blip plus what looks like crowns at Q in frames and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular. Long ago in a galaxy far away... uhm... well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now. Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits. And they aren't so easy to mis spell. And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips?   bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. Yes to start a new collection but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"?  fireball koi   fireball koi  Oh I'm sorry I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run. Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases. I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts . So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful.  bliplet at 49hz So "top attached blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the Hz. And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I will create such collection with this subject.

    Now consider the following Talk data for differences:
     That's what came to my mind first but most of the LFL are straight in frame and that's why I wasn't sure. Thanks I've added "Blip subclass blip" to my collections. Did not think this was violin because it appears to starting from a lower frequency in picture 4. Today we have violin and bass drum. It's subclass of violin.  Re S In relation to the shift report > BNS Range Mpc I thought that BNS was Binary Neutron Star and Mpc was megaparsec but I can understand this context. I could be totally wrong in my interpretation. Please can you explain what this means in simple terms! Thank you ZngabitanT  It shows noise level converted to Million light years. I think it was an indicator that even if merge event were to occur there it would still be detectable. discussion here projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2752251?comment  Thank you Nic . Very helpful.  Yes the current sensitivity of each of the GW observatories when it's up and running and able to collect science data is commonly expressed as the range in Megaparsecs from which a merger of two neutron stars could still be detected with adequate signal to noise ratio. The less instrumental noise the larger the BNS range. This is a figure of merit that's easily comparable between the different observatory sites and between different epochs at one and the same site as upgrades are made and noise sources come and go. Neutron stars rather than black holes are used for this purpose because they come in a limited range of masses between about 1. and less than solar masses and thus their mergers consistently produce gravitational waves at similar intensities within a factor of two or so they serve as "standard sirens" in analogy to the "standard candles" Cepheid variables supernovae of certain types... known from optical astronomy. Black holes come in a much larger range of sizes and their mergers produce GWs over a wide range of very different intensitities for a given distance . Stuff near the bottom edge of our spectrograms below Hz is often hard to classify for two reasons First there is very little information there to begin with. One second's worth of a steady sine wave shaped oscillation at Hz say corresponds to a mere ten crests and troughs and if such a sine wave isn't steady and varies in amplitude say half of the effect would end up out of sight below Hz. This aspect is where the additional context of surrounding subjects becomes helpful... Second the random background noise increases dramatically by several orders of magnitude! below about Hz towards the Hz bottom edge. We don't see this in our spectrograms the preprocessing equalizes it out making it look as if there was a constant amount of background noise at all frequencies. But in reality the top of for example a Scattered Light arch culminating at say Hz has to be much more intense to be visible above the background noise than the top of an arch culminating at say Hz and the flanks of the arches tend to get drowned out completely under the background at very low frequencies even when they have the same absolute intensity as the culminations . What's left for us to see may then look like a rounded LF Burst or like an elongated LF line depending on how long it lasted and depending on the Q value chosen to render the spectrogram. I reckon that most LFBs and LFLs arise in this way and in particular that most of the Hz "LF line" subjects from Livingston of which there are quite a few exist merely because there's so much background noise below Hz. Some might still originate in other ways. At any rate there hasn't been anything at Livingston known to genuinely oscillate at around Hz these LFLs aren't lines in the spectral line sense projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . There are some spectral lines at other low frequencies from periodically dithering the test mass mirrors by very small angles in both pitch and yaw as part of the alignment sensing and control but these produce stationary noise that's easily removed not transient noise that would show up as glitches. The LFB and LFL glitch classes are thus a compromise. They give us something to put subjects into when they sit at very low frequencies and when we can't make out any unambiguous arches but they don't necessarily coincide with specific glitch causes and noise coupling paths. And in the past there had already been a Zip violin projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposal... They are examples of what the engineers call "downconversion" When noise at the violin mode frequencies near multiples of Hz for LIGO isn't steady but varies in intensity at some lower frequencies some of these variations will show up in our spectrograms as additional noise near these lower frequencies. Thank you ZngabitanT and Nicm it all makes sense to me now! I should have asked this ages ago. I have heard about some of this before but not in relation to the observatories.  Viola? 743.60Hz  sb?  sb? Nearly mushrooms floating ones! Scattered light.  25sb This is all very interesting thank you for your thorough explanation as usual .

Do they have a name? Thank you and sorry to bother you with so many questions.  fireball koi   bliplet at 32hz Scattered light and low frequency line 23hz  fireballs  I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well. Ohhhh... sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button... Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts. They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones. I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet... Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness. Note the double tip at the top of the central shape.  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips... We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time 0. seconds provided it's recognizable . Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time. No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify. Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs. I'll just classify them as such for consistency. Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be. Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards. Now I need a new plan. Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad. I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order. My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago. I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information. Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes. I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections. I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches. Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI. What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible. It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house. I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O4. so there is no hurry for this information just yet. Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nic . I like being able to see the two "near time subjects". I guess this one can be classified as fireball koi instead of repeating koi.

    This data is from the Gravity Spy forum, called "Talk" data. Gravity Spy is a citizen science project which classifies glitches which occur because of enviornmental effects or engineering issues related to gravitational wave sensors designed by LIGO. My primary interest is in observing emerging topics in the data. Particularly, it would be valuable to summarize major questions or discoveries in the talk data. For example, it is valuable to know if the citizen scientists are proposing new glitch classes. If they are proposing new glitch classes, what gives the citizen scientists this impression? Alternatively, if there are emerging questions related to LIGO sensors or gravitational wave science, this would also be good to know. Also, what are their particular questions? Finally, do they have any hypotheses about where glitches come from, this would also be good to know. If they have these, what are their hypotheses?

User Prompt: 
    Consider Talk data set 1:
     This is an additional explanation I received. Hope it helps. From ZngabitanT Subject Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a seconds wide Gravity Spy subject. is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GW170817. It has been rendered at high Q 45. which brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subject's fourth frame and which doesn't do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the seconds mark. A low Q rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible. The very loud glitch just before time seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis. It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data. For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of and we're supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp.  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time 0. seconds or dominant at this time. This is mentioned in the FAQ projects zooniverse gravity spy about faq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it. In this way we help the Machine Learning to recognize e.g. a Whistle even when it is accompanied by Scattered Light or vice versa. Thank you for contributing!

The reported peak frequency of Hz for the present S and its duplicate S together with the date and the fact that it's from Hanford reveals it to be a rendering at lower than usual Q 22. of Slow Parallels projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . So the "least non obvious" feature in frame around Hz for some 0. seconds is "it" . Any parallels it may have had remain invisible under the random background noise at the low Q setting.

I will put it with the bliplets in any case. Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the 'eiffel' that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction. I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed? ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of "baby Tomtes" intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets... and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call "lower frequency blips" meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what we've been calling "bliplets" of late . There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under and just over Hz mostly in the bins around and Hz where we're finding the bliplets too. Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3. Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between and 22. But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets. So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples! I've also started doing a little in this direction but it's done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnish run "top attached" kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow.  Thank you and happy what's now left of to you too!  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams. Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data .

Massive koi fireballs eiffel Nice overlapping pair here showing the effect of the different Q value choices... Among the rather noisy mess here there's a central Virgo O angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk dominating the scene corroborated by the Hz peak frequency with a weather vane projects zooniverse gravity spy talk embedded slightly later. This in itself is somewhat remarkable. While such angel weather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O it's the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll mode projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment damper was disabled . On a few dozen other occasions the 9. Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch. The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far. This subject was recorded on at some point between 05. and UTC. And from a mere 0. seconds later we have... ...the overlapping continuation S of S now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane. The interferometer stayed locked for another seconds or so and lost lock at 14. Science Mode was reestablished by 56. The plots attached to the night shift report https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isn't clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before and then simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at and then the IMC lock dropped. ! plots around the 29T lockloss https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png One of the ASC loops in question had its set point tuned https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r later on implying it hadn't been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost . We don't know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that haven't been included among these plots were doing at the time. I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be. It's got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss... I do have a few robust ideas what it can't be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots e.g. PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis. The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range. This was done https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r a little later on 29.  If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGO's DHARD and TX TY representing theta X theta Y are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively. Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT. MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesn't have the PR PR folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta .  Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further. There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later. It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook . Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop. The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others . And it can open without the Metatron Guardian level automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more . From the events of 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r it can't be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches. The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see from 13T UTC elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r . Wherever there's a BNS range plot available around the time in question e.g. see again 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last. But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 0. Mpc. Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode. A common feature of most of the pre lockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions "10Hz" or "9.5Hz" or "9.7Hz" oscillations... which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damper projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment . When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 19. Hz roll mode harmonics... only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 14. So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . In particular the loop we're looking for is not that of the damper itself. A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a picked off beam centered on a quadrant photodiode. The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop. The causal connections remain mysterious for now. West End 9. Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop. The relatively frequent weather vane angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk combinations together with the run of angel willow compound glitches from November and the fact that Willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injection input side of the interferometer. But that's not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too. By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadn't been what triggered the subject... What would this disturbance be classified as? It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin.  Well observed and a peculiar catch! It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses short duration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown. Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes. We've embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class. You'll find several relevant discussion threads e.g. in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass "bliplet" with an unusually abrupt transition from "body" to "tail" but I'm not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the "tail" above it.  laughing laughing laughing "and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow." I wasn't sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but it's the best classification I could find for it. Thanks Nicm I'm glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily! It's interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next.  Several scattered light among those.

The glitch free picture is impressive but Not as a new GS logo! Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk celticlord and thank you for contributing! This subject and the others that Nicm has kindly pulled out of the database are among the last loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches from the third observing run.

And then the engineers used Gravity Spy data to validate that their fix was effective. Certainly so Brian.

CPwoSQP z  What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips. There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when it's recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud. Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballs projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet. You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk ! For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now Hanford Fireballish with koi https www.zooniverse.org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny hanford fireballish with koi Livingston Fireballish with koi https www.zooniverse.org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny livingston fireballish with koi to be compared with H Fireballish no koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny fireballish no koi L Fireballish no koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny fireballish no koi while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organ projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant loud blip group symmetric with koi grand organ  Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run "flowing down" from beyond the top edge . At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch and good question! The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole five minute run that Nicm has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like looking more like the former others like looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy tools https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like firmly on the LFB side. But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to at Hanford and prior to at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses. Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also don't involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question! The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count in steps of ten the different hues used to represent the noise energy levels from dark violet at for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25. for the most energetic parts of the glitch. These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than uhm that not very bright shade of turquoise". In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential arm length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy. Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. It probably originated as a compound of two or three near simultaneous small sort of blips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around and around Hz. Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search . 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end. Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes this is Scattered Light " la Virgo O3" and yes these can sometimes fail to look very arch like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to kHz for more than seconds although peaking at 21. Hz that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject. Running this through a similarity search https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search asking for results from Virgo era O produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well developed little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 0221 b 107d 46ee 859e e .png Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish are bright ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location f f 437b bc 5 .png Rows of arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 3b c 4 f 99e 22274071545a.png And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 2245 e 4 e fd 0 a a .png Putting all these possibilities together we may arrive at cases like the present subject. On a few rare occasions during O Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns . Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency causes optical resonance as glitches. timestamp 19T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page Livingston no recorded as glitches H1O3a 19T 38.

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet?  Nicm I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q.  blip plus what looks like crowns at Q in frames and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular. Long ago in a galaxy far away... uhm... well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now. Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits. And they aren't so easy to mis spell. And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips?   bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. Yes to start a new collection but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"?  fireball koi   fireball koi  Oh I'm sorry I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run. Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases. I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts . So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful.  bliplet at 49hz So "top attached blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the Hz. And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I will create such collection with this subject.

    Now consider Talk data set 2:
     That's what came to my mind first but most of the LFL are straight in frame and that's why I wasn't sure. Thanks I've added "Blip subclass blip" to my collections. Did not think this was violin because it appears to starting from a lower frequency in picture 4. Today we have violin and bass drum. It's subclass of violin.  Re S In relation to the shift report > BNS Range Mpc I thought that BNS was Binary Neutron Star and Mpc was megaparsec but I can understand this context. I could be totally wrong in my interpretation. Please can you explain what this means in simple terms! Thank you ZngabitanT  It shows noise level converted to Million light years. I think it was an indicator that even if merge event were to occur there it would still be detectable. discussion here projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2752251?comment  Thank you Nic . Very helpful.  Yes the current sensitivity of each of the GW observatories when it's up and running and able to collect science data is commonly expressed as the range in Megaparsecs from which a merger of two neutron stars could still be detected with adequate signal to noise ratio. The less instrumental noise the larger the BNS range. This is a figure of merit that's easily comparable between the different observatory sites and between different epochs at one and the same site as upgrades are made and noise sources come and go. Neutron stars rather than black holes are used for this purpose because they come in a limited range of masses between about 1. and less than solar masses and thus their mergers consistently produce gravitational waves at similar intensities within a factor of two or so they serve as "standard sirens" in analogy to the "standard candles" Cepheid variables supernovae of certain types... known from optical astronomy. Black holes come in a much larger range of sizes and their mergers produce GWs over a wide range of very different intensitities for a given distance . Stuff near the bottom edge of our spectrograms below Hz is often hard to classify for two reasons First there is very little information there to begin with. One second's worth of a steady sine wave shaped oscillation at Hz say corresponds to a mere ten crests and troughs and if such a sine wave isn't steady and varies in amplitude say half of the effect would end up out of sight below Hz. This aspect is where the additional context of surrounding subjects becomes helpful... Second the random background noise increases dramatically by several orders of magnitude! below about Hz towards the Hz bottom edge. We don't see this in our spectrograms the preprocessing equalizes it out making it look as if there was a constant amount of background noise at all frequencies. But in reality the top of for example a Scattered Light arch culminating at say Hz has to be much more intense to be visible above the background noise than the top of an arch culminating at say Hz and the flanks of the arches tend to get drowned out completely under the background at very low frequencies even when they have the same absolute intensity as the culminations . What's left for us to see may then look like a rounded LF Burst or like an elongated LF line depending on how long it lasted and depending on the Q value chosen to render the spectrogram. I reckon that most LFBs and LFLs arise in this way and in particular that most of the Hz "LF line" subjects from Livingston of which there are quite a few exist merely because there's so much background noise below Hz. Some might still originate in other ways. At any rate there hasn't been anything at Livingston known to genuinely oscillate at around Hz these LFLs aren't lines in the spectral line sense projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . There are some spectral lines at other low frequencies from periodically dithering the test mass mirrors by very small angles in both pitch and yaw as part of the alignment sensing and control but these produce stationary noise that's easily removed not transient noise that would show up as glitches. The LFB and LFL glitch classes are thus a compromise. They give us something to put subjects into when they sit at very low frequencies and when we can't make out any unambiguous arches but they don't necessarily coincide with specific glitch causes and noise coupling paths. And in the past there had already been a Zip violin projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposal... They are examples of what the engineers call "downconversion" When noise at the violin mode frequencies near multiples of Hz for LIGO isn't steady but varies in intensity at some lower frequencies some of these variations will show up in our spectrograms as additional noise near these lower frequencies. Thank you ZngabitanT and Nicm it all makes sense to me now! I should have asked this ages ago. I have heard about some of this before but not in relation to the observatories.  Viola? 743.60Hz  sb?  sb? Nearly mushrooms floating ones! Scattered light.  25sb This is all very interesting thank you for your thorough explanation as usual .

Do they have a name? Thank you and sorry to bother you with so many questions.  fireball koi   bliplet at 32hz Scattered light and low frequency line 23hz  fireballs  I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well. Ohhhh... sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button... Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts. They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones. I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet... Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness. Note the double tip at the top of the central shape.  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips... We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time 0. seconds provided it's recognizable . Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time. No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify. Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs. I'll just classify them as such for consistency. Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be. Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards. Now I need a new plan. Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad. I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order. My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago. I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information. Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes. I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections. I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches. Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI. What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible. It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house. I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O4. so there is no hurry for this information just yet. Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nic . I like being able to see the two "near time subjects". I guess this one can be classified as fireball koi instead of repeating koi.

    Talk data set 1 and 2 are forum confersation data associated with classifying glitches associated with enviornmental or engineering factors which affect sensors designed by LIGO. 
    
    My primary interest is in considering novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1. For example, it is valuable to know if the citizen scientists are proposing new glitch classes. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class, the glitch class. Alternatively, if there are emerging questions related to LIGO sensors or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2, describe the questions and the context of the question. Finally, does Talk data set 2 suggest new hypotheses about where glitch origins? What are these hypotheses and what is the hypothesis context? Be as specific as possible.

User Prompt: 
    Consider Talk data set 1:
     This is an additional explanation I received. Hope it helps. From ZngabitanT Subject Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a seconds wide Gravity Spy subject. is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GW170817. It has been rendered at high Q 45. which brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subject's fourth frame and which doesn't do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the seconds mark. A low Q rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible. The very loud glitch just before time seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis. It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data. For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of and we're supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp.  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time 0. seconds or dominant at this time. This is mentioned in the FAQ projects zooniverse gravity spy about faq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it. In this way we help the Machine Learning to recognize e.g. a Whistle even when it is accompanied by Scattered Light or vice versa. Thank you for contributing!

So the "least non obvious" feature in frame around Hz for some 0. seconds is "it" . Any parallels it may have had remain invisible under the random background noise at the low Q setting.

I will put it with the bliplets in any case. Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the 'eiffel' that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction. I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed? ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of "baby Tomtes" intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets... and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call "lower frequency blips" meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what we've been calling "bliplets" of late . There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under and just over Hz mostly in the bins around and Hz where we're finding the bliplets too. Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3. Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between and 22. But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets. So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples! I've also started doing a little in this direction but it's done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnish run "top attached" kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow.  Thank you and happy what's now left of to you too!  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams. Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data . The spectrogram images are merely the icing on the cake they do not preserve enough of the relevant information adding some "eye candy" for the benefit of a broader audience.

Massive koi fireballs eiffel Nice overlapping pair here showing the effect of the different Q value choices... Among the rather noisy mess here there's a central Virgo O angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk dominating the scene corroborated by the Hz peak frequency with a weather vane projects zooniverse gravity spy talk embedded slightly later. This in itself is somewhat remarkable. While such angel weather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O it's the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll mode projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment damper was disabled . On a few dozen other occasions the 9. Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch. The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far. This subject was recorded on at some point between 05. and UTC. And from a mere 0. seconds later we have... ...the overlapping continuation S of S now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane. The interferometer stayed locked for another seconds or so and lost lock at 14. Science Mode was reestablished by 56. The plots attached to the night shift report https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isn't clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before and then simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at and then the IMC lock dropped. ! plots around the 29T lockloss https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png One of the ASC loops in question had its set point tuned https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r later on implying it hadn't been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost . We don't know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that haven't been included among these plots were doing at the time. I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be. It's got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss... I do have a few robust ideas what it can't be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots e.g. PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis. The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range. This was done https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r a little later on 29.  If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGO's DHARD and TX TY representing theta X theta Y are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively. Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT. MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesn't have the PR PR folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta .  Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further. There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later. It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook . Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop. The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others . And it can open without the Metatron Guardian level automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more . From the events of 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r it can't be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches. The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see from 13T UTC elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r . Wherever there's a BNS range plot available around the time in question e.g. see again 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last. But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 0. Mpc. Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode. A common feature of most of the pre lockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions "10Hz" or "9.5Hz" or "9.7Hz" oscillations... which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damper projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment . When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 19. Hz roll mode harmonics... only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 14. So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . In particular the loop we're looking for is not that of the damper itself. A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a picked off beam centered on a quadrant photodiode. The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop. The causal connections remain mysterious for now. West End 9. Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop. The relatively frequent weather vane angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk combinations together with the run of angel willow compound glitches from November and the fact that Willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injection input side of the interferometer. But that's not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too. By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadn't been what triggered the subject... What would this disturbance be classified as? It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin.  Well observed and a peculiar catch! It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses short duration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown. Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes. We've embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class. You'll find several relevant discussion threads e.g. in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass "bliplet" with an unusually abrupt transition from "body" to "tail" but I'm not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the "tail" above it.  laughing laughing laughing "and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow." I wasn't sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but it's the best classification I could find for it. Thanks Nicm I'm glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily! It's interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next.  Several scattered light among those.

This subject and the others that Nicm has kindly pulled out of the database are among the last loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches from the third observing run.

And then the engineers used Gravity Spy data to validate that their fix was effective. Certainly so Brian.

CPwoSQP z  What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips. There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when it's recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud. Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballs projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet. You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk ! For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now Hanford Fireballish with koi https www.zooniverse.org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny hanford fireballish with koi Livingston Fireballish with koi https www.zooniverse.org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny livingston fireballish with koi to be compared with H Fireballish no koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny fireballish no koi L Fireballish no koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny fireballish no koi while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organ projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant loud blip group symmetric with koi grand organ  Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run "flowing down" from beyond the top edge . At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch and good question! The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole five minute run that Nicm has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like looking more like the former others like looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy tools https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like firmly on the LFB side. But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to at Hanford and prior to at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses. Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also don't involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question! The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count in steps of ten the different hues used to represent the noise energy levels from dark violet at for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25. for the most energetic parts of the glitch. These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than uhm that not very bright shade of turquoise". In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential arm length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy. Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. It probably originated as a compound of two or three near simultaneous small sort of blips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around and around Hz. Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search . 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end. Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes this is Scattered Light " la Virgo O3" and yes these can sometimes fail to look very arch like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to kHz for more than seconds although peaking at 21. Hz that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject. Running this through a similarity search https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search asking for results from Virgo era O produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well developed little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 0221 b 107d 46ee 859e e .png Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish are bright ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location f f 437b bc 5 .png Rows of arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 3b c 4 f 99e 22274071545a.png And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 2245 e 4 e fd 0 a a .png Putting all these possibilities together we may arrive at cases like the present subject. On a few rare occasions during O Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns . Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency causes optical resonance as glitches. timestamp 19T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page Livingston no recorded as glitches H1O3a 19T 38.

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet?  Nicm I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q.  blip plus what looks like crowns at Q in frames and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular. Long ago in a galaxy far away... uhm... well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now. Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits. And they aren't so easy to mis spell. And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips?   bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. Yes to start a new collection but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"?  fireball koi   fireball koi  Oh I'm sorry I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run. Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases. I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts . So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful.  bliplet at 49hz So "top attached blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the Hz. And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I will create such collection with this subject.

    Now consider Talk data set 2:
     That's what came to my mind first but most of the LFL are straight in frame and that's why I wasn't sure. Thanks I've added "Blip subclass blip" to my collections. Did not think this was violin because it appears to starting from a lower frequency in picture 4. Today we have violin and bass drum. It's subclass of violin.  Re S In relation to the shift report > BNS Range Mpc I thought that BNS was Binary Neutron Star and Mpc was megaparsec but I can understand this context. I could be totally wrong in my interpretation. Please can you explain what this means in simple terms! Thank you ZngabitanT  It shows noise level converted to Million light years. I think it was an indicator that even if merge event were to occur there it would still be detectable. discussion here projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2752251?comment  Thank you Nic . Very helpful.  Yes the current sensitivity of each of the GW observatories when it's up and running and able to collect science data is commonly expressed as the range in Megaparsecs from which a merger of two neutron stars could still be detected with adequate signal to noise ratio. The less instrumental noise the larger the BNS range. This is a figure of merit that's easily comparable between the different observatory sites and between different epochs at one and the same site as upgrades are made and noise sources come and go. Neutron stars rather than black holes are used for this purpose because they come in a limited range of masses between about 1. and less than solar masses and thus their mergers consistently produce gravitational waves at similar intensities within a factor of two or so they serve as "standard sirens" in analogy to the "standard candles" Cepheid variables supernovae of certain types... known from optical astronomy. Black holes come in a much larger range of sizes and their mergers produce GWs over a wide range of very different intensitities for a given distance . Stuff near the bottom edge of our spectrograms below Hz is often hard to classify for two reasons First there is very little information there to begin with. One second's worth of a steady sine wave shaped oscillation at Hz say corresponds to a mere ten crests and troughs and if such a sine wave isn't steady and varies in amplitude say half of the effect would end up out of sight below Hz. This aspect is where the additional context of surrounding subjects becomes helpful... Second the random background noise increases dramatically by several orders of magnitude! below about Hz towards the Hz bottom edge. We don't see this in our spectrograms the preprocessing equalizes it out making it look as if there was a constant amount of background noise at all frequencies. But in reality the top of for example a Scattered Light arch culminating at say Hz has to be much more intense to be visible above the background noise than the top of an arch culminating at say Hz and the flanks of the arches tend to get drowned out completely under the background at very low frequencies even when they have the same absolute intensity as the culminations . What's left for us to see may then look like a rounded LF Burst or like an elongated LF line depending on how long it lasted and depending on the Q value chosen to render the spectrogram. I reckon that most LFBs and LFLs arise in this way and in particular that most of the Hz "LF line" subjects from Livingston of which there are quite a few exist merely because there's so much background noise below Hz. Some might still originate in other ways. At any rate there hasn't been anything at Livingston known to genuinely oscillate at around Hz these LFLs aren't lines in the spectral line sense projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . There are some spectral lines at other low frequencies from periodically dithering the test mass mirrors by very small angles in both pitch and yaw as part of the alignment sensing and control but these produce stationary noise that's easily removed not transient noise that would show up as glitches. The LFB and LFL glitch classes are thus a compromise. They give us something to put subjects into when they sit at very low frequencies and when we can't make out any unambiguous arches but they don't necessarily coincide with specific glitch causes and noise coupling paths. And in the past there had already been a Zip violin projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposal... They are examples of what the engineers call "downconversion" When noise at the violin mode frequencies near multiples of Hz for LIGO isn't steady but varies in intensity at some lower frequencies some of these variations will show up in our spectrograms as additional noise near these lower frequencies. Thank you ZngabitanT and Nicm it all makes sense to me now! I should have asked this ages ago. I have heard about some of this before but not in relation to the observatories.  Viola? 743.60Hz  sb?  sb? Nearly mushrooms floating ones! Scattered light.  25sb This is all very interesting thank you for your thorough explanation as usual .

Do they have a name? Thank you and sorry to bother you with so many questions.  fireball koi   bliplet at 32hz Scattered light and low frequency line 23hz  fireballs  I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well. Ohhhh... sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button... Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts. They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones. I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet... Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness. Note the double tip at the top of the central shape.  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips... We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time 0. seconds provided it's recognizable . Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time. No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify. Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs. I'll just classify them as such for consistency. Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be. Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards. Now I need a new plan. Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad. I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order. My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago. I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information. Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes. I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections. I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches. Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI. What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible. It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house. I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O4. so there is no hurry for this information just yet. Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nic .

    Talk data set 1 and 2 are forum confersation data associated with classifying glitches associated with enviornmental or engineering factors which affect sensors designed by LIGO. 
    
    My primary interest is in considering novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1. For example, it is valuable to know if the citizen scientists are proposing new glitch classes. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class, the glitch class. Alternatively, if there are emerging questions related to LIGO sensors or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2, describe the questions and the context of the question. Finally, does Talk data set 2 suggest new hypotheses about where glitch origins? What are these hypotheses and what is the hypothesis context? Be as specific as possible.

    Consider Talk data set 1:
     This is an additional explanation I received. Hope it helps. From ZngabitanT Subject Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a seconds wide Gravity Spy subject. is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GW170817. It has been rendered at high Q 45. which brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subject's fourth frame and which doesn't do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the seconds mark. A low Q rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible. The very loud glitch just before time seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis. It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data. For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of and we're supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp.  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time 0. seconds or dominant at this time. This is mentioned in the FAQ projects zooniverse gravity spy about faq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it. In this way we help the Machine Learning to recognize e.g. a Whistle even when it is accompanied by Scattered Light or vice versa. Thank you for contributing!

So the "least non obvious" feature in frame around Hz for some 0. seconds is "it" . Any parallels it may have had remain invisible under the random background noise at the low Q setting.

I will put it with the bliplets in any case. Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the 'eiffel' that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction. I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed? ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of "baby Tomtes" intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets... and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call "lower frequency blips" meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what we've been calling "bliplets" of late . There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under and just over Hz mostly in the bins around and Hz where we're finding the bliplets too. Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3. Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between and 22. But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets. So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples! I've also started doing a little in this direction but it's done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnish run "top attached" kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow.  Thank you and happy what's now left of to you too!  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams. Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data . The spectrogram images are merely the icing on the cake they do not preserve enough of the relevant information adding some "eye candy" for the benefit of a broader audience.

Massive koi fireballs eiffel Nice overlapping pair here showing the effect of the different Q value choices... Among the rather noisy mess here there's a central Virgo O angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk dominating the scene corroborated by the Hz peak frequency with a weather vane projects zooniverse gravity spy talk embedded slightly later. This in itself is somewhat remarkable. While such angel weather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O it's the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll mode projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment damper was disabled . On a few dozen other occasions the 9. Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch. The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far. This subject was recorded on at some point between 05. and UTC. And from a mere 0. seconds later we have... ...the overlapping continuation S of S now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane. The interferometer stayed locked for another seconds or so and lost lock at 14. Science Mode was reestablished by 56. The plots attached to the night shift report https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isn't clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before and then simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at and then the IMC lock dropped. ! plots around the 29T lockloss https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png One of the ASC loops in question had its set point tuned https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r later on implying it hadn't been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost . We don't know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that haven't been included among these plots were doing at the time. I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be. It's got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss... I do have a few robust ideas what it can't be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots e.g. PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis. The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range. This was done https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r a little later on 29.  If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGO's DHARD and TX TY representing theta X theta Y are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively. Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT. MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesn't have the PR PR folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta .  Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further. There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later. It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook . Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop. The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others . And it can open without the Metatron Guardian level automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more . From the events of 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r it can't be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches. The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see from 13T UTC elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r . Wherever there's a BNS range plot available around the time in question e.g. see again 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last. But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 0. Mpc. Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode. A common feature of most of the pre lockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions "10Hz" or "9.5Hz" or "9.7Hz" oscillations... which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damper projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment . When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 19. Hz roll mode harmonics... only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 14. So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . In particular the loop we're looking for is not that of the damper itself. A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a picked off beam centered on a quadrant photodiode. The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop. The causal connections remain mysterious for now. West End 9. Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop. The relatively frequent weather vane angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk combinations together with the run of angel willow compound glitches from November and the fact that Willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injection input side of the interferometer. But that's not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too. By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadn't been what triggered the subject... What would this disturbance be classified as? It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin.  Well observed and a peculiar catch! It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses short duration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown. Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes. We've embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class. You'll find several relevant discussion threads e.g. in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass "bliplet" with an unusually abrupt transition from "body" to "tail" but I'm not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the "tail" above it.  laughing laughing laughing "and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow." I wasn't sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but it's the best classification I could find for it. Thanks Nicm I'm glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily! It's interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next.  Several scattered light among those.

CPwoSQP z  What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips. There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when it's recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud. Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballs projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet. You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk ! For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now Hanford Fireballish with koi https www.zooniverse.org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny hanford fireballish with koi Livingston Fireballish with koi https www.zooniverse.org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny livingston fireballish with koi to be compared with H Fireballish no koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny fireballish no koi L Fireballish no koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny fireballish no koi while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organ projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant loud blip group symmetric with koi grand organ  Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run "flowing down" from beyond the top edge . At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch and good question! The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole five minute run that Nicm has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like looking more like the former others like looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy tools https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like firmly on the LFB side. But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to at Hanford and prior to at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses. Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also don't involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question! The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count in steps of ten the different hues used to represent the noise energy levels from dark violet at for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25. for the most energetic parts of the glitch. These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than uhm that not very bright shade of turquoise". In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential arm length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy. Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. It probably originated as a compound of two or three near simultaneous small sort of blips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around and around Hz. Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search . 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end. Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes this is Scattered Light " la Virgo O3" and yes these can sometimes fail to look very arch like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to kHz for more than seconds although peaking at 21. Hz that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject. Running this through a similarity search https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search asking for results from Virgo era O produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well developed little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 0221 b 107d 46ee 859e e .png Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish are bright ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location f f 437b bc 5 .png Rows of arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 3b c 4 f 99e 22274071545a.png And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 2245 e 4 e fd 0 a a .png Putting all these possibilities together we may arrive at cases like the present subject. On a few rare occasions during O Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns . Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency causes optical resonance as glitches. timestamp 19T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page Livingston no recorded as glitches H1O3a 19T 38.

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet?  Nicm I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q.  blip plus what looks like crowns at Q in frames and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular. Long ago in a galaxy far away... uhm... well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now. Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits. And they aren't so easy to mis spell. And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips?   bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. Yes to start a new collection but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"?  fireball koi   fireball koi  Oh I'm sorry I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run. Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases. I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts . So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful.  bliplet at 49hz So "top attached blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the Hz. And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I will create such collection with this subject.

    Now consider Talk data set 2:
     That's what came to my mind first but most of the LFL are straight in frame and that's why I wasn't sure. Thanks I've added "Blip subclass blip" to my collections. Did not think this was violin because it appears to starting from a lower frequency in picture 4. Today we have violin and bass drum. It's subclass of violin.  Re S In relation to the shift report > BNS Range Mpc I thought that BNS was Binary Neutron Star and Mpc was megaparsec but I can understand this context. I could be totally wrong in my interpretation. Please can you explain what this means in simple terms! Thank you ZngabitanT  It shows noise level converted to Million light years. I think it was an indicator that even if merge event were to occur there it would still be detectable. discussion here projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2752251?comment  Thank you Nic . Very helpful.  Yes the current sensitivity of each of the GW observatories when it's up and running and able to collect science data is commonly expressed as the range in Megaparsecs from which a merger of two neutron stars could still be detected with adequate signal to noise ratio. The less instrumental noise the larger the BNS range. This is a figure of merit that's easily comparable between the different observatory sites and between different epochs at one and the same site as upgrades are made and noise sources come and go. Neutron stars rather than black holes are used for this purpose because they come in a limited range of masses between about 1. and less than solar masses and thus their mergers consistently produce gravitational waves at similar intensities within a factor of two or so they serve as "standard sirens" in analogy to the "standard candles" Cepheid variables supernovae of certain types... known from optical astronomy. Black holes come in a much larger range of sizes and their mergers produce GWs over a wide range of very different intensitities for a given distance . Stuff near the bottom edge of our spectrograms below Hz is often hard to classify for two reasons First there is very little information there to begin with. One second's worth of a steady sine wave shaped oscillation at Hz say corresponds to a mere ten crests and troughs and if such a sine wave isn't steady and varies in amplitude say half of the effect would end up out of sight below Hz. This aspect is where the additional context of surrounding subjects becomes helpful... Second the random background noise increases dramatically by several orders of magnitude! below about Hz towards the Hz bottom edge. We don't see this in our spectrograms the preprocessing equalizes it out making it look as if there was a constant amount of background noise at all frequencies. But in reality the top of for example a Scattered Light arch culminating at say Hz has to be much more intense to be visible above the background noise than the top of an arch culminating at say Hz and the flanks of the arches tend to get drowned out completely under the background at very low frequencies even when they have the same absolute intensity as the culminations . What's left for us to see may then look like a rounded LF Burst or like an elongated LF line depending on how long it lasted and depending on the Q value chosen to render the spectrogram. I reckon that most LFBs and LFLs arise in this way and in particular that most of the Hz "LF line" subjects from Livingston of which there are quite a few exist merely because there's so much background noise below Hz. Some might still originate in other ways. At any rate there hasn't been anything at Livingston known to genuinely oscillate at around Hz these LFLs aren't lines in the spectral line sense projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . There are some spectral lines at other low frequencies from periodically dithering the test mass mirrors by very small angles in both pitch and yaw as part of the alignment sensing and control but these produce stationary noise that's easily removed not transient noise that would show up as glitches. The LFB and LFL glitch classes are thus a compromise. They give us something to put subjects into when they sit at very low frequencies and when we can't make out any unambiguous arches but they don't necessarily coincide with specific glitch causes and noise coupling paths. And in the past there had already been a Zip violin projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposal... They are examples of what the engineers call "downconversion" When noise at the violin mode frequencies near multiples of Hz for LIGO isn't steady but varies in intensity at some lower frequencies some of these variations will show up in our spectrograms as additional noise near these lower frequencies. Thank you ZngabitanT and Nicm it all makes sense to me now! I should have asked this ages ago. I have heard about some of this before but not in relation to the observatories.  Viola? 743.60Hz  sb?  sb? Nearly mushrooms floating ones! Scattered light.  25sb This is all very interesting thank you for your thorough explanation as usual .

Do they have a name? Thank you and sorry to bother you with so many questions.  fireball koi   bliplet at 32hz Scattered light and low frequency line 23hz  fireballs  I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well. Ohhhh... sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button... Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts. They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones. I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet... Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness. Note the double tip at the top of the central shape.  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips... We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time 0. seconds provided it's recognizable . Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time. No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify. Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs. I'll just classify them as such for consistency. Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be. Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards. Now I need a new plan. Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad. I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order. My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago. I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information. Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes. I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections. I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches. Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI. What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible. It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house. I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O4. so there is no hurry for this information just yet. Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nic .

    My primary interest is in considering novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1. For example, it is valuable to know if the citizen scientists are proposing new glitch classes. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class, the glitch class. Alternatively, if there are emerging questions related to LIGO sensors or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2, describe the questions and the context of the question. Finally, does Talk data set 2 suggest new hypotheses about where glitch origins? What are these hypotheses and what is the hypothesis context? Be as specific as possible.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers.

    Consider Talk data set 1:
     This is an additional explanation I received. Hope it helps. From ZngabitanT Subject Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a seconds wide Gravity Spy subject. is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GW170817. It has been rendered at high Q 45. which brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subject's fourth frame and which doesn't do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the seconds mark. A low Q rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible. The very loud glitch just before time seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis. It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data. For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of and we're supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp.  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time 0. seconds or dominant at this time. This is mentioned in the FAQ projects zooniverse gravity spy about faq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it. In this way we help the Machine Learning to recognize e.g. a Whistle even when it is accompanied by Scattered Light or vice versa. Thank you for contributing!

I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed? ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of "baby Tomtes" intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets... and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call "lower frequency blips" meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what we've been calling "bliplets" of late . There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under and just over Hz mostly in the bins around and Hz where we're finding the bliplets too. Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3. Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between and 22. But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets. So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples! I've also started doing a little in this direction but it's done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnish run "top attached" kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow.  Thank you and happy what's now left of to you too!  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams. Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data .

Massive koi fireballs eiffel Nice overlapping pair here showing the effect of the different Q value choices... Among the rather noisy mess here there's a central Virgo O angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk dominating the scene corroborated by the Hz peak frequency with a weather vane projects zooniverse gravity spy talk embedded slightly later. This in itself is somewhat remarkable. While such angel weather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O it's the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll mode projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment damper was disabled . On a few dozen other occasions the 9. Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch. The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far. This subject was recorded on at some point between 05. and UTC. And from a mere 0. seconds later we have... ...the overlapping continuation S of S now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane. The interferometer stayed locked for another seconds or so and lost lock at 14. Science Mode was reestablished by 56. The plots attached to the night shift report https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isn't clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before and then simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at and then the IMC lock dropped. ! plots around the 29T lockloss https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png One of the ASC loops in question had its set point tuned https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r later on implying it hadn't been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost . We don't know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that haven't been included among these plots were doing at the time. I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be. It's got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss... I do have a few robust ideas what it can't be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots e.g. PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis. The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range. This was done https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r a little later on 29.  If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGO's DHARD and TX TY representing theta X theta Y are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively. Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT. MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesn't have the PR PR folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta .  Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further. There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later. It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook . Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop. The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others . And it can open without the Metatron Guardian level automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more . From the events of 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r it can't be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches. The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see from 13T UTC elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r . Wherever there's a BNS range plot available around the time in question e.g. see again 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last. But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 0. Mpc. Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode. A common feature of most of the pre lockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions "10Hz" or "9.5Hz" or "9.7Hz" oscillations... which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damper projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment . When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 19. Hz roll mode harmonics... only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 14. So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . In particular the loop we're looking for is not that of the damper itself. A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a picked off beam centered on a quadrant photodiode. The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop. The causal connections remain mysterious for now. West End 9. Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop. The relatively frequent weather vane angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk combinations together with the run of angel willow compound glitches from November and the fact that Willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injection input side of the interferometer. But that's not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too. By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadn't been what triggered the subject... What would this disturbance be classified as? It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin.  Well observed and a peculiar catch! It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses short duration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown. Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes. We've embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class. You'll find several relevant discussion threads e.g. in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass "bliplet" with an unusually abrupt transition from "body" to "tail" but I'm not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the "tail" above it.  laughing laughing laughing "and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow." I wasn't sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but it's the best classification I could find for it. Thanks Nicm I'm glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily!

CPwoSQP z  What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips. There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when it's recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud. Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballs projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet. You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk ! For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now Hanford Fireballish with koi https www.zooniverse.org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny hanford fireballish with koi Livingston Fireballish with koi https www.zooniverse.org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny livingston fireballish with koi to be compared with H Fireballish no koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny fireballish no koi L Fireballish no koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny fireballish no koi while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organ projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant loud blip group symmetric with koi grand organ  Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run "flowing down" from beyond the top edge . At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch and good question! The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole five minute run that Nicm has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like looking more like the former others like looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy tools https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like firmly on the LFB side. But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to at Hanford and prior to at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses. Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also don't involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question! The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count in steps of ten the different hues used to represent the noise energy levels from dark violet at for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25. for the most energetic parts of the glitch. These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than uhm that not very bright shade of turquoise". In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential arm length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy. Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. It probably originated as a compound of two or three near simultaneous small sort of blips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around and around Hz. Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search . 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end. Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes this is Scattered Light " la Virgo O3" and yes these can sometimes fail to look very arch like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to kHz for more than seconds although peaking at 21. Hz that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject. Running this through a similarity search https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search asking for results from Virgo era O produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well developed little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 0221 b 107d 46ee 859e e .png Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish are bright ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location f f 437b bc 5 .png Rows of arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 3b c 4 f 99e 22274071545a.png And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 2245 e 4 e fd 0 a a .png Putting all these possibilities together we may arrive at cases like the present subject. On a few rare occasions during O Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns . Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency causes optical resonance as glitches. timestamp 19T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page Livingston no recorded as glitches H1O3a 19T 38.

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet?  Nicm I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q.  blip plus what looks like crowns at Q in frames and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular. Long ago in a galaxy far away... uhm... well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now. Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits. And they aren't so easy to mis spell. And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips?   bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. Yes to start a new collection but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"?  fireball koi   fireball koi  Oh I'm sorry I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run. Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases. I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts . So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful.  bliplet at 49hz So "top attached blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the Hz. And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I will create such collection with this subject.

    Now consider Talk data set 2:
     That's what came to my mind first but most of the LFL are straight in frame and that's why I wasn't sure. Thanks I've added "Blip subclass blip" to my collections. Did not think this was violin because it appears to starting from a lower frequency in picture 4. Today we have violin and bass drum. It's subclass of violin.  Re S In relation to the shift report > BNS Range Mpc I thought that BNS was Binary Neutron Star and Mpc was megaparsec but I can understand this context. I could be totally wrong in my interpretation. Please can you explain what this means in simple terms! Thank you ZngabitanT  It shows noise level converted to Million light years. I think it was an indicator that even if merge event were to occur there it would still be detectable. discussion here projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2752251?comment  Thank you Nic . Very helpful.  Yes the current sensitivity of each of the GW observatories when it's up and running and able to collect science data is commonly expressed as the range in Megaparsecs from which a merger of two neutron stars could still be detected with adequate signal to noise ratio. The less instrumental noise the larger the BNS range. This is a figure of merit that's easily comparable between the different observatory sites and between different epochs at one and the same site as upgrades are made and noise sources come and go. Neutron stars rather than black holes are used for this purpose because they come in a limited range of masses between about 1. and less than solar masses and thus their mergers consistently produce gravitational waves at similar intensities within a factor of two or so they serve as "standard sirens" in analogy to the "standard candles" Cepheid variables supernovae of certain types... known from optical astronomy. Black holes come in a much larger range of sizes and their mergers produce GWs over a wide range of very different intensitities for a given distance . Stuff near the bottom edge of our spectrograms below Hz is often hard to classify for two reasons First there is very little information there to begin with. One second's worth of a steady sine wave shaped oscillation at Hz say corresponds to a mere ten crests and troughs and if such a sine wave isn't steady and varies in amplitude say half of the effect would end up out of sight below Hz. This aspect is where the additional context of surrounding subjects becomes helpful... Second the random background noise increases dramatically by several orders of magnitude! below about Hz towards the Hz bottom edge. We don't see this in our spectrograms the preprocessing equalizes it out making it look as if there was a constant amount of background noise at all frequencies. But in reality the top of for example a Scattered Light arch culminating at say Hz has to be much more intense to be visible above the background noise than the top of an arch culminating at say Hz and the flanks of the arches tend to get drowned out completely under the background at very low frequencies even when they have the same absolute intensity as the culminations . What's left for us to see may then look like a rounded LF Burst or like an elongated LF line depending on how long it lasted and depending on the Q value chosen to render the spectrogram. I reckon that most LFBs and LFLs arise in this way and in particular that most of the Hz "LF line" subjects from Livingston of which there are quite a few exist merely because there's so much background noise below Hz. Some might still originate in other ways. At any rate there hasn't been anything at Livingston known to genuinely oscillate at around Hz these LFLs aren't lines in the spectral line sense projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . There are some spectral lines at other low frequencies from periodically dithering the test mass mirrors by very small angles in both pitch and yaw as part of the alignment sensing and control but these produce stationary noise that's easily removed not transient noise that would show up as glitches. The LFB and LFL glitch classes are thus a compromise. They give us something to put subjects into when they sit at very low frequencies and when we can't make out any unambiguous arches but they don't necessarily coincide with specific glitch causes and noise coupling paths. And in the past there had already been a Zip violin projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposal... They are examples of what the engineers call "downconversion" When noise at the violin mode frequencies near multiples of Hz for LIGO isn't steady but varies in intensity at some lower frequencies some of these variations will show up in our spectrograms as additional noise near these lower frequencies. Thank you ZngabitanT and Nicm it all makes sense to me now! I should have asked this ages ago. I have heard about some of this before but not in relation to the observatories.  Viola? 743.60Hz  sb?  sb? Nearly mushrooms floating ones! Scattered light.  25sb This is all very interesting thank you for your thorough explanation as usual .

Do they have a name? Thank you and sorry to bother you with so many questions.  fireball koi   bliplet at 32hz Scattered light and low frequency line 23hz  fireballs  I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well. Ohhhh... sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button... Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts. They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones. I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet... Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness. Note the double tip at the top of the central shape.  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips... We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time 0. seconds provided it's recognizable . Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time. No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify. Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs. I'll just classify them as such for consistency. Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be. Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards. Now I need a new plan. Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad. I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order. My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago. I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information. Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes. I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections. I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches. Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI. What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible. It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house. I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O4. so there is no hurry for this information just yet. Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nic .

    My primary interest is in considering novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1. For example, it is valuable to know if the citizen scientists are proposing new glitch classes. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class, the glitch class. Alternatively, if there are emerging questions related to LIGO sensors or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2, describe the questions and the context of the question. Finally, does Talk data set 2 suggest new hypotheses about where glitch origins? What are these hypotheses and what is the hypothesis context? Be as specific as possible.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers.

    Consider Talk data set 1:
     This is an additional explanation I received. Hope it helps. From ZngabitanT Subject Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a seconds wide Gravity Spy subject. is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GW170817. It has been rendered at high Q 45. which brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subject's fourth frame and which doesn't do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the seconds mark. A low Q rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible. The very loud glitch just before time seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis. It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data. For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of and we're supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp.  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time 0. seconds or dominant at this time. This is mentioned in the FAQ projects zooniverse gravity spy about faq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it. In this way we help the Machine Learning to recognize e.g. a Whistle even when it is accompanied by Scattered Light or vice versa. Thank you for contributing!

I will put it with the bliplets in any case. Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the 'eiffel' that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction. I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed? ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of "baby Tomtes" intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets... and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call "lower frequency blips" meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what we've been calling "bliplets" of late . There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under and just over Hz mostly in the bins around and Hz where we're finding the bliplets too. Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3. Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between and 22. But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets. So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples! I've also started doing a little in this direction but it's done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnish run "top attached" kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow.  Thank you and happy what's now left of to you too!  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams. Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data .

Massive koi fireballs eiffel Nice overlapping pair here showing the effect of the different Q value choices... Among the rather noisy mess here there's a central Virgo O angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk dominating the scene corroborated by the Hz peak frequency with a weather vane projects zooniverse gravity spy talk embedded slightly later. This in itself is somewhat remarkable. While such angel weather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O it's the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll mode projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment damper was disabled . On a few dozen other occasions the 9. Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch. The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far. This subject was recorded on at some point between 05. and UTC. And from a mere 0. seconds later we have... ...the overlapping continuation S of S now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane. The interferometer stayed locked for another seconds or so and lost lock at 14. Science Mode was reestablished by 56. The plots attached to the night shift report https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isn't clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before and then simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at and then the IMC lock dropped. ! plots around the 29T lockloss https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png One of the ASC loops in question had its set point tuned https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r later on implying it hadn't been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost . We don't know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that haven't been included among these plots were doing at the time. I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be. It's got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss... I do have a few robust ideas what it can't be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots e.g. PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis. The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range. This was done https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r a little later on 29.  If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGO's DHARD and TX TY representing theta X theta Y are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively. Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT. MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesn't have the PR PR folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta .  Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further. There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later. It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook . Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop. The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others . And it can open without the Metatron Guardian level automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more . From the events of 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r it can't be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches. The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see from 13T UTC elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r . Wherever there's a BNS range plot available around the time in question e.g. see again 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last. But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 0. Mpc. Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode. A common feature of most of the pre lockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions "10Hz" or "9.5Hz" or "9.7Hz" oscillations... which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damper projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment . When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 19. Hz roll mode harmonics... only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 14. So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . In particular the loop we're looking for is not that of the damper itself. A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a picked off beam centered on a quadrant photodiode. The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop. The causal connections remain mysterious for now. West End 9. Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop. The relatively frequent weather vane angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk combinations together with the run of angel willow compound glitches from November and the fact that Willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injection input side of the interferometer. But that's not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too. By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadn't been what triggered the subject... What would this disturbance be classified as? It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin.  Well observed and a peculiar catch! It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses short duration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown. Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes. We've embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class. You'll find several relevant discussion threads e.g. in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass "bliplet" with an unusually abrupt transition from "body" to "tail" but I'm not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the "tail" above it.  laughing laughing laughing "and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow." I wasn't sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but it's the best classification I could find for it. Thanks Nicm I'm glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily!

The glitch free picture is impressive but Not as a new GS logo! Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk celticlord and thank you for contributing! This subject and the others that Nicm has kindly pulled out of the database are among the last loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches from the third observing run.

And then the engineers used Gravity Spy data to validate that their fix was effective. Certainly so Brian.

CPwoSQP z  What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips. There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when it's recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud. Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballs projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet. You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk !

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch and good question! The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole five minute run that Nicm has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like looking more like the former others like looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy tools https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like firmly on the LFB side. But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to at Hanford and prior to at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses. Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also don't involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question! The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count in steps of ten the different hues used to represent the noise energy levels from dark violet at for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25. for the most energetic parts of the glitch. These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than uhm that not very bright shade of turquoise". In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential arm length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy. Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. It probably originated as a compound of two or three near simultaneous small sort of blips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around and around Hz. Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search . 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end. Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes this is Scattered Light " la Virgo O3" and yes these can sometimes fail to look very arch like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to kHz for more than seconds although peaking at 21. Hz that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject. Running this through a similarity search https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search asking for results from Virgo era O produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well developed little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 0221 b 107d 46ee 859e e .png Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish are bright ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location f f 437b bc 5 .png Rows of arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 3b c 4 f 99e 22274071545a.png And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 2245 e 4 e fd 0 a a .png Putting all these possibilities together we may arrive at cases like the present subject. On a few rare occasions during O Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns . Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency causes optical resonance as glitches. timestamp 19T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page Livingston no recorded as glitches H1O3a 19T 38.

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet?  Nicm I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q.  blip plus what looks like crowns at Q in frames and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular. Long ago in a galaxy far away... uhm... well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now. Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits. And they aren't so easy to mis spell. And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips?   bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. Yes to start a new collection but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"?  fireball koi   fireball koi  Oh I'm sorry I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run. Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases. I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts . So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful.  bliplet at 49hz So "top attached blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the Hz. And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I will create such collection with this subject.

    Now consider Talk data set 2:
     That's what came to my mind first but most of the LFL are straight in frame and that's why I wasn't sure. Thanks I've added "Blip subclass blip" to my collections. Did not think this was violin because it appears to starting from a lower frequency in picture 4. Today we have violin and bass drum. It's subclass of violin.  Re S In relation to the shift report > BNS Range Mpc I thought that BNS was Binary Neutron Star and Mpc was megaparsec but I can understand this context. I could be totally wrong in my interpretation. Please can you explain what this means in simple terms! Thank you ZngabitanT  It shows noise level converted to Million light years. I think it was an indicator that even if merge event were to occur there it would still be detectable. discussion here projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2752251?comment  Thank you Nic . Very helpful.  Yes the current sensitivity of each of the GW observatories when it's up and running and able to collect science data is commonly expressed as the range in Megaparsecs from which a merger of two neutron stars could still be detected with adequate signal to noise ratio. The less instrumental noise the larger the BNS range. This is a figure of merit that's easily comparable between the different observatory sites and between different epochs at one and the same site as upgrades are made and noise sources come and go. Neutron stars rather than black holes are used for this purpose because they come in a limited range of masses between about 1. and less than solar masses and thus their mergers consistently produce gravitational waves at similar intensities within a factor of two or so they serve as "standard sirens" in analogy to the "standard candles" Cepheid variables supernovae of certain types... known from optical astronomy. Black holes come in a much larger range of sizes and their mergers produce GWs over a wide range of very different intensitities for a given distance . Stuff near the bottom edge of our spectrograms below Hz is often hard to classify for two reasons First there is very little information there to begin with. One second's worth of a steady sine wave shaped oscillation at Hz say corresponds to a mere ten crests and troughs and if such a sine wave isn't steady and varies in amplitude say half of the effect would end up out of sight below Hz. This aspect is where the additional context of surrounding subjects becomes helpful... Second the random background noise increases dramatically by several orders of magnitude! below about Hz towards the Hz bottom edge. We don't see this in our spectrograms the preprocessing equalizes it out making it look as if there was a constant amount of background noise at all frequencies. But in reality the top of for example a Scattered Light arch culminating at say Hz has to be much more intense to be visible above the background noise than the top of an arch culminating at say Hz and the flanks of the arches tend to get drowned out completely under the background at very low frequencies even when they have the same absolute intensity as the culminations . What's left for us to see may then look like a rounded LF Burst or like an elongated LF line depending on how long it lasted and depending on the Q value chosen to render the spectrogram. I reckon that most LFBs and LFLs arise in this way and in particular that most of the Hz "LF line" subjects from Livingston of which there are quite a few exist merely because there's so much background noise below Hz. Some might still originate in other ways. At any rate there hasn't been anything at Livingston known to genuinely oscillate at around Hz these LFLs aren't lines in the spectral line sense projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . There are some spectral lines at other low frequencies from periodically dithering the test mass mirrors by very small angles in both pitch and yaw as part of the alignment sensing and control but these produce stationary noise that's easily removed not transient noise that would show up as glitches. The LFB and LFL glitch classes are thus a compromise. They give us something to put subjects into when they sit at very low frequencies and when we can't make out any unambiguous arches but they don't necessarily coincide with specific glitch causes and noise coupling paths. And in the past there had already been a Zip violin projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposal... They are examples of what the engineers call "downconversion" When noise at the violin mode frequencies near multiples of Hz for LIGO isn't steady but varies in intensity at some lower frequencies some of these variations will show up in our spectrograms as additional noise near these lower frequencies. Thank you ZngabitanT and Nicm it all makes sense to me now! I should have asked this ages ago. I have heard about some of this before but not in relation to the observatories.  Viola? 743.60Hz  sb?  sb? Nearly mushrooms floating ones! Scattered light.  25sb This is all very interesting thank you for your thorough explanation as usual .

Do they have a name? Thank you and sorry to bother you with so many questions.  fireball koi   bliplet at 32hz Scattered light and low frequency line 23hz  fireballs  I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well. Ohhhh... sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button... Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts. They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones. I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet... Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness. Note the double tip at the top of the central shape.  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips... We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time 0. seconds provided it's recognizable . Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time. No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify. Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs. I'll just classify them as such for consistency. Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be. Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards. Now I need a new plan. Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad. I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order. My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago. I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information. Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes. I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections. I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches. Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI. What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible. It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house. I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O4. so there is no hurry for this information just yet. Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nic .

    My primary interest is in considering novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1. For example, it is valuable to know if the citizen scientists are proposing new glitch classes. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class, the glitch class. Alternatively, if there are emerging questions related to LIGO sensors or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2, describe the questions and the context of the question. Finally, does Talk data set 2 suggest new hypotheses about where glitch origins? What are these hypotheses and what is the hypothesis context? Be as specific as possible.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:
     This is an additional explanation I received. Hope it helps. From ZngabitanT Subject Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a seconds wide Gravity Spy subject. is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GW170817. It has been rendered at high Q 45. which brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subject's fourth frame and which doesn't do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the seconds mark. A low Q rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible. The very loud glitch just before time seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis. It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data. For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of and we're supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp.  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time 0. seconds or dominant at this time. This is mentioned in the FAQ projects zooniverse gravity spy about faq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it. In this way we help the Machine Learning to recognize e.g. a Whistle even when it is accompanied by Scattered Light or vice versa. Thank you for contributing!

So the "least non obvious" feature in frame around Hz for some 0. seconds is "it" . Any parallels it may have had remain invisible under the random background noise at the low Q setting.

I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed? ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of "baby Tomtes" intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets... and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call "lower frequency blips" meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what we've been calling "bliplets" of late . There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under and just over Hz mostly in the bins around and Hz where we're finding the bliplets too. Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3. Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between and 22. But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets. So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples! I've also started doing a little in this direction but it's done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnish run "top attached" kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow.  Thank you and happy what's now left of to you too!  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams. Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data .

Massive koi fireballs eiffel Nice overlapping pair here showing the effect of the different Q value choices... Among the rather noisy mess here there's a central Virgo O angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk dominating the scene corroborated by the Hz peak frequency with a weather vane projects zooniverse gravity spy talk embedded slightly later. This in itself is somewhat remarkable. While such angel weather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O it's the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll mode projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment damper was disabled . On a few dozen other occasions the 9. Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch. The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far. This subject was recorded on at some point between 05. and UTC. And from a mere 0. seconds later we have... ...the overlapping continuation S of S now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane. The interferometer stayed locked for another seconds or so and lost lock at 14. Science Mode was reestablished by 56. The plots attached to the night shift report https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isn't clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before and then simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at and then the IMC lock dropped. ! plots around the 29T lockloss https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png One of the ASC loops in question had its set point tuned https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r later on implying it hadn't been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost . We don't know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that haven't been included among these plots were doing at the time. I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be. It's got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss... I do have a few robust ideas what it can't be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots e.g. PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis. The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range. This was done https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r a little later on 29.  If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGO's DHARD and TX TY representing theta X theta Y are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively. Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT. MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesn't have the PR PR folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta .  Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further. There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later. It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook . Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop. The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others . And it can open without the Metatron Guardian level automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more . From the events of 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r it can't be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches. The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see from 13T UTC elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r . Wherever there's a BNS range plot available around the time in question e.g. see again 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last. But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 0. Mpc. Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode. A common feature of most of the pre lockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions "10Hz" or "9.5Hz" or "9.7Hz" oscillations... which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damper projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment . When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 19. Hz roll mode harmonics... only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 14. So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . In particular the loop we're looking for is not that of the damper itself. A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a picked off beam centered on a quadrant photodiode. The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop. The causal connections remain mysterious for now. West End 9. Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop. The relatively frequent weather vane angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk combinations together with the run of angel willow compound glitches from November and the fact that Willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injection input side of the interferometer. But that's not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too. By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadn't been what triggered the subject... What would this disturbance be classified as? It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin.  Well observed and a peculiar catch! It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses short duration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown. Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes. We've embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class. You'll find several relevant discussion threads e.g. in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass "bliplet" with an unusually abrupt transition from "body" to "tail" but I'm not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the "tail" above it.  laughing laughing laughing "and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow." I wasn't sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but it's the best classification I could find for it. Thanks Nicm I'm glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily! It's interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next.  Several scattered light among those.

It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips. There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when it's recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud. Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballs projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet. You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk !

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch and good question! The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole five minute run that Nicm has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like looking more like the former others like looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy tools https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like firmly on the LFB side. But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to at Hanford and prior to at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses. Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also don't involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question! The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count in steps of ten the different hues used to represent the noise energy levels from dark violet at for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25. for the most energetic parts of the glitch. These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than uhm that not very bright shade of turquoise". In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential arm length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy. Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. It probably originated as a compound of two or three near simultaneous small sort of blips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around and around Hz. Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search . 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end. Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes this is Scattered Light " la Virgo O3" and yes these can sometimes fail to look very arch like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to kHz for more than seconds although peaking at 21. Hz that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject. Running this through a similarity search https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search asking for results from Virgo era O produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well developed little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 0221 b 107d 46ee 859e e .png Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish are bright ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location f f 437b bc 5 .png Rows of arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 3b c 4 f 99e 22274071545a.png And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 2245 e 4 e fd 0 a a .png Putting all these possibilities together we may arrive at cases like the present subject. On a few rare occasions during O Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns . Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency causes optical resonance as glitches. timestamp 19T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page Livingston no recorded as glitches H1O3a 19T 38.

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet?  Nicm I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q.  blip plus what looks like crowns at Q in frames and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular. Long ago in a galaxy far away... uhm... well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now. Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits. And they aren't so easy to mis spell. And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips?   bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. Yes to start a new collection but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"?  fireball koi   fireball koi  Oh I'm sorry I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run. Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases. I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts . So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful.  bliplet at 49hz So "top attached blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the Hz. And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I will create such collection with this subject.

     That's what came to my mind first but most of the LFL are straight in frame and that's why I wasn't sure. Thanks I've added "Blip subclass blip" to my collections. Did not think this was violin because it appears to starting from a lower frequency in picture 4. Today we have violin and bass drum. It's subclass of violin.  Re S In relation to the shift report > BNS Range Mpc I thought that BNS was Binary Neutron Star and Mpc was megaparsec but I can understand this context. I could be totally wrong in my interpretation. Please can you explain what this means in simple terms! Thank you ZngabitanT  It shows noise level converted to Million light years. I think it was an indicator that even if merge event were to occur there it would still be detectable. discussion here projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2752251?comment  Thank you Nic . Very helpful.  Yes the current sensitivity of each of the GW observatories when it's up and running and able to collect science data is commonly expressed as the range in Megaparsecs from which a merger of two neutron stars could still be detected with adequate signal to noise ratio. The less instrumental noise the larger the BNS range. This is a figure of merit that's easily comparable between the different observatory sites and between different epochs at one and the same site as upgrades are made and noise sources come and go. Neutron stars rather than black holes are used for this purpose because they come in a limited range of masses between about 1. and less than solar masses and thus their mergers consistently produce gravitational waves at similar intensities within a factor of two or so they serve as "standard sirens" in analogy to the "standard candles" Cepheid variables supernovae of certain types... known from optical astronomy. Black holes come in a much larger range of sizes and their mergers produce GWs over a wide range of very different intensitities for a given distance . Stuff near the bottom edge of our spectrograms below Hz is often hard to classify for two reasons First there is very little information there to begin with. One second's worth of a steady sine wave shaped oscillation at Hz say corresponds to a mere ten crests and troughs and if such a sine wave isn't steady and varies in amplitude say half of the effect would end up out of sight below Hz. This aspect is where the additional context of surrounding subjects becomes helpful... Second the random background noise increases dramatically by several orders of magnitude! below about Hz towards the Hz bottom edge. We don't see this in our spectrograms the preprocessing equalizes it out making it look as if there was a constant amount of background noise at all frequencies. But in reality the top of for example a Scattered Light arch culminating at say Hz has to be much more intense to be visible above the background noise than the top of an arch culminating at say Hz and the flanks of the arches tend to get drowned out completely under the background at very low frequencies even when they have the same absolute intensity as the culminations . What's left for us to see may then look like a rounded LF Burst or like an elongated LF line depending on how long it lasted and depending on the Q value chosen to render the spectrogram. I reckon that most LFBs and LFLs arise in this way and in particular that most of the Hz "LF line" subjects from Livingston of which there are quite a few exist merely because there's so much background noise below Hz. Some might still originate in other ways. At any rate there hasn't been anything at Livingston known to genuinely oscillate at around Hz these LFLs aren't lines in the spectral line sense projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . There are some spectral lines at other low frequencies from periodically dithering the test mass mirrors by very small angles in both pitch and yaw as part of the alignment sensing and control but these produce stationary noise that's easily removed not transient noise that would show up as glitches. The LFB and LFL glitch classes are thus a compromise. They give us something to put subjects into when they sit at very low frequencies and when we can't make out any unambiguous arches but they don't necessarily coincide with specific glitch causes and noise coupling paths. And in the past there had already been a Zip violin projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposal... They are examples of what the engineers call "downconversion" When noise at the violin mode frequencies near multiples of Hz for LIGO isn't steady but varies in intensity at some lower frequencies some of these variations will show up in our spectrograms as additional noise near these lower frequencies. Thank you ZngabitanT and Nicm it all makes sense to me now! I should have asked this ages ago. I have heard about some of this before but not in relation to the observatories.  Viola? 743.60Hz  sb?  sb? Nearly mushrooms floating ones! Scattered light.  25sb This is all very interesting thank you for your thorough explanation as usual .

Do they have a name? Thank you and sorry to bother you with so many questions.  fireball koi   bliplet at 32hz Scattered light and low frequency line 23hz  fireballs  I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well. Ohhhh... sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button... Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts. They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones. I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet... Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness. Note the double tip at the top of the central shape.  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips... We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time 0. seconds provided it's recognizable . Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time. No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify. Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs. I'll just classify them as such for consistency. Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be. Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards. Now I need a new plan. Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad. I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order. My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago. I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information. Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes. I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections. I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches. Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI. What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible. It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house. I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O4. so there is no hurry for this information just yet. Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nic .

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. It is valuable to know if the citizen scientists are proposing new glitch classes. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class, the glitch class.

    2. If there are emerging questions related to LIGO sensors or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2, describe the questions and the context of the question.
    
    3. Does Talk data set 2 suggest new hypotheses about where glitch origins? What are these hypotheses and what is the hypothesis context? Be as specific as possible.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:
     This is an additional explanation I received. Hope it helps. From ZngabitanT Subject Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a seconds wide Gravity Spy subject. is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GW170817. It has been rendered at high Q 45. which brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subject's fourth frame and which doesn't do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the seconds mark. A low Q rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible. The very loud glitch just before time seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis. It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data. For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of and we're supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp.  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time 0. seconds or dominant at this time. This is mentioned in the FAQ projects zooniverse gravity spy about faq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it. In this way we help the Machine Learning to recognize e.g. a Whistle even when it is accompanied by Scattered Light or vice versa. Thank you for contributing!

I will put it with the bliplets in any case. Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the 'eiffel' that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction. I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed? ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of "baby Tomtes" intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets... and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call "lower frequency blips" meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what we've been calling "bliplets" of late . There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under and just over Hz mostly in the bins around and Hz where we're finding the bliplets too. Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3. Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between and 22. But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets. So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples! I've also started doing a little in this direction but it's done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnish run "top attached" kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow.  Thank you and happy what's now left of to you too!  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams. Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data .

Massive koi fireballs eiffel Nice overlapping pair here showing the effect of the different Q value choices... Among the rather noisy mess here there's a central Virgo O angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk dominating the scene corroborated by the Hz peak frequency with a weather vane projects zooniverse gravity spy talk embedded slightly later. This in itself is somewhat remarkable. While such angel weather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O it's the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll mode projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment damper was disabled . On a few dozen other occasions the 9. Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch. The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far. This subject was recorded on at some point between 05. and UTC. And from a mere 0. seconds later we have... ...the overlapping continuation S of S now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane. The interferometer stayed locked for another seconds or so and lost lock at 14. Science Mode was reestablished by 56. The plots attached to the night shift report https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isn't clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before and then simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at and then the IMC lock dropped. ! plots around the 29T lockloss https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png One of the ASC loops in question had its set point tuned https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r later on implying it hadn't been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost . We don't know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that haven't been included among these plots were doing at the time. I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be. It's got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss... I do have a few robust ideas what it can't be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots e.g. PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis. The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range. This was done https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r a little later on 29.  If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGO's DHARD and TX TY representing theta X theta Y are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively. Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT. MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesn't have the PR PR folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta .  Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further. There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later. It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook . Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop. The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others . And it can open without the Metatron Guardian level automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more . From the events of 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r it can't be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches. The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see from 13T UTC elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r . Wherever there's a BNS range plot available around the time in question e.g. see again 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last. But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 0. Mpc. Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode. A common feature of most of the pre lockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions "10Hz" or "9.5Hz" or "9.7Hz" oscillations... which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damper projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment . When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 19. Hz roll mode harmonics... only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 14. So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . In particular the loop we're looking for is not that of the damper itself. A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a picked off beam centered on a quadrant photodiode. The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop. The causal connections remain mysterious for now. West End 9. Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop. The relatively frequent weather vane angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk combinations together with the run of angel willow compound glitches from November and the fact that Willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injection input side of the interferometer. But that's not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too. By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadn't been what triggered the subject... What would this disturbance be classified as? It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin.  Well observed and a peculiar catch! It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses short duration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown. Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes. We've embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class. You'll find several relevant discussion threads e.g. in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass "bliplet" with an unusually abrupt transition from "body" to "tail" but I'm not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the "tail" above it.  laughing laughing laughing "and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow." I wasn't sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but it's the best classification I could find for it. Thanks Nicm I'm glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily! It's interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next.  Several scattered light among those.

CPwoSQP z  What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips. There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when it's recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud. Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballs projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet. You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk !

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch and good question! The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole five minute run that Nicm has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like looking more like the former others like looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy tools https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like firmly on the LFB side. But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to at Hanford and prior to at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses. Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also don't involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question! The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count in steps of ten the different hues used to represent the noise energy levels from dark violet at for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25. for the most energetic parts of the glitch. These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than uhm that not very bright shade of turquoise". In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential arm length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy. Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. It probably originated as a compound of two or three near simultaneous small sort of blips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around and around Hz. Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search . 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end. Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes this is Scattered Light " la Virgo O3" and yes these can sometimes fail to look very arch like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to kHz for more than seconds although peaking at 21. Hz that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject. Running this through a similarity search https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search asking for results from Virgo era O produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well developed little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 0221 b 107d 46ee 859e e .png Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish are bright ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location f f 437b bc 5 .png Rows of arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 3b c 4 f 99e 22274071545a.png And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 2245 e 4 e fd 0 a a .png Putting all these possibilities together we may arrive at cases like the present subject. On a few rare occasions during O Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns . Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency causes optical resonance as glitches. timestamp 19T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page Livingston no recorded as glitches H1O3a 19T 38.

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet?  Nicm I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q.  blip plus what looks like crowns at Q in frames and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular. Long ago in a galaxy far away... uhm... well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now. Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits. And they aren't so easy to mis spell. And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips?   bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. Yes to start a new collection but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"?  fireball koi   fireball koi  Oh I'm sorry I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run. Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases. I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts . So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful.  bliplet at 49hz So "top attached blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the Hz. And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I will create such collection with this subject.

     That's what came to my mind first but most of the LFL are straight in frame and that's why I wasn't sure. Thanks I've added "Blip subclass blip" to my collections. Did not think this was violin because it appears to starting from a lower frequency in picture 4. Today we have violin and bass drum. It's subclass of violin.  Re S In relation to the shift report > BNS Range Mpc I thought that BNS was Binary Neutron Star and Mpc was megaparsec but I can understand this context. I could be totally wrong in my interpretation. Please can you explain what this means in simple terms! Thank you ZngabitanT  It shows noise level converted to Million light years. I think it was an indicator that even if merge event were to occur there it would still be detectable. discussion here projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2752251?comment  Thank you Nic . Very helpful.  Yes the current sensitivity of each of the GW observatories when it's up and running and able to collect science data is commonly expressed as the range in Megaparsecs from which a merger of two neutron stars could still be detected with adequate signal to noise ratio. The less instrumental noise the larger the BNS range. This is a figure of merit that's easily comparable between the different observatory sites and between different epochs at one and the same site as upgrades are made and noise sources come and go. Neutron stars rather than black holes are used for this purpose because they come in a limited range of masses between about 1. and less than solar masses and thus their mergers consistently produce gravitational waves at similar intensities within a factor of two or so they serve as "standard sirens" in analogy to the "standard candles" Cepheid variables supernovae of certain types... known from optical astronomy. Black holes come in a much larger range of sizes and their mergers produce GWs over a wide range of very different intensitities for a given distance . Stuff near the bottom edge of our spectrograms below Hz is often hard to classify for two reasons First there is very little information there to begin with. One second's worth of a steady sine wave shaped oscillation at Hz say corresponds to a mere ten crests and troughs and if such a sine wave isn't steady and varies in amplitude say half of the effect would end up out of sight below Hz. This aspect is where the additional context of surrounding subjects becomes helpful... Second the random background noise increases dramatically by several orders of magnitude! below about Hz towards the Hz bottom edge. We don't see this in our spectrograms the preprocessing equalizes it out making it look as if there was a constant amount of background noise at all frequencies. But in reality the top of for example a Scattered Light arch culminating at say Hz has to be much more intense to be visible above the background noise than the top of an arch culminating at say Hz and the flanks of the arches tend to get drowned out completely under the background at very low frequencies even when they have the same absolute intensity as the culminations . What's left for us to see may then look like a rounded LF Burst or like an elongated LF line depending on how long it lasted and depending on the Q value chosen to render the spectrogram. I reckon that most LFBs and LFLs arise in this way and in particular that most of the Hz "LF line" subjects from Livingston of which there are quite a few exist merely because there's so much background noise below Hz. Some might still originate in other ways. At any rate there hasn't been anything at Livingston known to genuinely oscillate at around Hz these LFLs aren't lines in the spectral line sense projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . There are some spectral lines at other low frequencies from periodically dithering the test mass mirrors by very small angles in both pitch and yaw as part of the alignment sensing and control but these produce stationary noise that's easily removed not transient noise that would show up as glitches. The LFB and LFL glitch classes are thus a compromise. They give us something to put subjects into when they sit at very low frequencies and when we can't make out any unambiguous arches but they don't necessarily coincide with specific glitch causes and noise coupling paths. And in the past there had already been a Zip violin projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposal... They are examples of what the engineers call "downconversion" When noise at the violin mode frequencies near multiples of Hz for LIGO isn't steady but varies in intensity at some lower frequencies some of these variations will show up in our spectrograms as additional noise near these lower frequencies. Thank you ZngabitanT and Nicm it all makes sense to me now! I should have asked this ages ago. I have heard about some of this before but not in relation to the observatories.  Viola? 743.60Hz  sb?  sb? Nearly mushrooms floating ones! Scattered light.  25sb This is all very interesting thank you for your thorough explanation as usual .

Do they have a name? Thank you and sorry to bother you with so many questions.  fireball koi   bliplet at 32hz Scattered light and low frequency line 23hz  fireballs  I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well. Ohhhh... sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button... Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts. They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones. I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet... Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness. Note the double tip at the top of the central shape.  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips... We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time 0. seconds provided it's recognizable . Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time. No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify. Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs. I'll just classify them as such for consistency. Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be. Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards. Now I need a new plan. Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad. I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order. My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago. I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information. Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes. I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections. I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches. Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI. What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible. It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house. I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O4. so there is no hurry for this information just yet. Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nic .

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. It is valuable to know if the citizen scientists are proposing new glitch classes. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class, the glitch class.

    2. If there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2, describe the questions and the context of the question. These indicate dynamics in learning and classification of glitches by cititzen scientists.

    3. Does Talk data set 2 suggest new hypotheses about where glitch origins? What are these hypotheses and what is the hypothesis context? Be as specific as possible.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:
     This is an additional explanation I received. Hope it helps. From ZngabitanT Subject Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a seconds wide Gravity Spy subject. is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GW170817. It has been rendered at high Q 45. which brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subject's fourth frame and which doesn't do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the seconds mark. A low Q rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible. The very loud glitch just before time seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis. It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data. For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of and we're supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp.  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time 0. seconds or dominant at this time. This is mentioned in the FAQ projects zooniverse gravity spy about faq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it. In this way we help the Machine Learning to recognize e.g. a Whistle even when it is accompanied by Scattered Light or vice versa. Thank you for contributing!

I will put it with the bliplets in any case. Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the 'eiffel' that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction. I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed? ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of "baby Tomtes" intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets... and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call "lower frequency blips" meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what we've been calling "bliplets" of late . There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under and just over Hz mostly in the bins around and Hz where we're finding the bliplets too. Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3. Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between and 22. But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets. So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples! I've also started doing a little in this direction but it's done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnish run "top attached" kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow.  Thank you and happy what's now left of to you too!  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams. Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data .

Massive koi fireballs eiffel Nice overlapping pair here showing the effect of the different Q value choices... Among the rather noisy mess here there's a central Virgo O angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk dominating the scene corroborated by the Hz peak frequency with a weather vane projects zooniverse gravity spy talk embedded slightly later. This in itself is somewhat remarkable. While such angel weather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O it's the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll mode projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment damper was disabled . On a few dozen other occasions the 9. Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch. The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far. This subject was recorded on at some point between 05. and UTC. And from a mere 0. seconds later we have... ...the overlapping continuation S of S now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane. The interferometer stayed locked for another seconds or so and lost lock at 14. Science Mode was reestablished by 56. The plots attached to the night shift report https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isn't clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before and then simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at and then the IMC lock dropped. ! plots around the 29T lockloss https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png One of the ASC loops in question had its set point tuned https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r later on implying it hadn't been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost . We don't know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that haven't been included among these plots were doing at the time. I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be. It's got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss... I do have a few robust ideas what it can't be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots e.g. PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis. The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range. This was done https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r a little later on 29.  If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGO's DHARD and TX TY representing theta X theta Y are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively. Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT. MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesn't have the PR PR folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta .  Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further. There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later. It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook . Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop. The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others . And it can open without the Metatron Guardian level automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more . From the events of 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r it can't be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches. The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see from 13T UTC elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r . Wherever there's a BNS range plot available around the time in question e.g. see again 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last. But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 0. Mpc. Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode. A common feature of most of the pre lockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions "10Hz" or "9.5Hz" or "9.7Hz" oscillations... which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damper projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment . When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 19. Hz roll mode harmonics... only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 14. So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . In particular the loop we're looking for is not that of the damper itself. A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a picked off beam centered on a quadrant photodiode. The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop. The causal connections remain mysterious for now. West End 9. Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop. The relatively frequent weather vane angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk combinations together with the run of angel willow compound glitches from November and the fact that Willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injection input side of the interferometer. But that's not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too. By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadn't been what triggered the subject... What would this disturbance be classified as? It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin.  Well observed and a peculiar catch! It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses short duration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown. Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes. We've embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class. You'll find several relevant discussion threads e.g. in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass "bliplet" with an unusually abrupt transition from "body" to "tail" but I'm not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the "tail" above it.  laughing laughing laughing "and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow." I wasn't sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but it's the best classification I could find for it. Thanks Nicm I'm glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily! It's interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next.  Several scattered light among those.

CPwoSQP z  What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips. There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when it's recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud. Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballs projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet. You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk !

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch and good question! The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole five minute run that Nicm has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like looking more like the former others like looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy tools https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like firmly on the LFB side. But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to at Hanford and prior to at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses. Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also don't involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question! The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count in steps of ten the different hues used to represent the noise energy levels from dark violet at for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25. for the most energetic parts of the glitch. These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than uhm that not very bright shade of turquoise". In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential arm length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy. Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. It probably originated as a compound of two or three near simultaneous small sort of blips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around and around Hz. Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search . 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end. Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes this is Scattered Light " la Virgo O3" and yes these can sometimes fail to look very arch like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to kHz for more than seconds although peaking at 21. Hz that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject. Running this through a similarity search https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search asking for results from Virgo era O produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well developed little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 0221 b 107d 46ee 859e e .png Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish are bright ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location f f 437b bc 5 .png Rows of arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 3b c 4 f 99e 22274071545a.png And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 2245 e 4 e fd 0 a a .png Putting all these possibilities together we may arrive at cases like the present subject. On a few rare occasions during O Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns . Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency causes optical resonance as glitches. timestamp 19T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page Livingston no recorded as glitches H1O3a 19T 38.

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet?  Nicm I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q.  blip plus what looks like crowns at Q in frames and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular. Long ago in a galaxy far away... uhm... well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now. Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits. And they aren't so easy to mis spell. And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips?   bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. Yes to start a new collection but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"?  fireball koi   fireball koi  Oh I'm sorry I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run. Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases. I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts . So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful.  bliplet at 49hz So "top attached blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the Hz. And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I will create such collection with this subject.

     That's what came to my mind first but most of the LFL are straight in frame and that's why I wasn't sure. Thanks I've added "Blip subclass blip" to my collections. Did not think this was violin because it appears to starting from a lower frequency in picture 4. Today we have violin and bass drum. It's subclass of violin.  Re S In relation to the shift report > BNS Range Mpc I thought that BNS was Binary Neutron Star and Mpc was megaparsec but I can understand this context. I could be totally wrong in my interpretation. Please can you explain what this means in simple terms! Thank you ZngabitanT  It shows noise level converted to Million light years. I think it was an indicator that even if merge event were to occur there it would still be detectable. discussion here projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2752251?comment  Thank you Nic . Very helpful.  Yes the current sensitivity of each of the GW observatories when it's up and running and able to collect science data is commonly expressed as the range in Megaparsecs from which a merger of two neutron stars could still be detected with adequate signal to noise ratio. The less instrumental noise the larger the BNS range. This is a figure of merit that's easily comparable between the different observatory sites and between different epochs at one and the same site as upgrades are made and noise sources come and go. Neutron stars rather than black holes are used for this purpose because they come in a limited range of masses between about 1. and less than solar masses and thus their mergers consistently produce gravitational waves at similar intensities within a factor of two or so they serve as "standard sirens" in analogy to the "standard candles" Cepheid variables supernovae of certain types... known from optical astronomy. Black holes come in a much larger range of sizes and their mergers produce GWs over a wide range of very different intensitities for a given distance . Stuff near the bottom edge of our spectrograms below Hz is often hard to classify for two reasons First there is very little information there to begin with. One second's worth of a steady sine wave shaped oscillation at Hz say corresponds to a mere ten crests and troughs and if such a sine wave isn't steady and varies in amplitude say half of the effect would end up out of sight below Hz. This aspect is where the additional context of surrounding subjects becomes helpful... Second the random background noise increases dramatically by several orders of magnitude! below about Hz towards the Hz bottom edge. We don't see this in our spectrograms the preprocessing equalizes it out making it look as if there was a constant amount of background noise at all frequencies. But in reality the top of for example a Scattered Light arch culminating at say Hz has to be much more intense to be visible above the background noise than the top of an arch culminating at say Hz and the flanks of the arches tend to get drowned out completely under the background at very low frequencies even when they have the same absolute intensity as the culminations . What's left for us to see may then look like a rounded LF Burst or like an elongated LF line depending on how long it lasted and depending on the Q value chosen to render the spectrogram. I reckon that most LFBs and LFLs arise in this way and in particular that most of the Hz "LF line" subjects from Livingston of which there are quite a few exist merely because there's so much background noise below Hz. Some might still originate in other ways. At any rate there hasn't been anything at Livingston known to genuinely oscillate at around Hz these LFLs aren't lines in the spectral line sense projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . There are some spectral lines at other low frequencies from periodically dithering the test mass mirrors by very small angles in both pitch and yaw as part of the alignment sensing and control but these produce stationary noise that's easily removed not transient noise that would show up as glitches. The LFB and LFL glitch classes are thus a compromise. They give us something to put subjects into when they sit at very low frequencies and when we can't make out any unambiguous arches but they don't necessarily coincide with specific glitch causes and noise coupling paths. And in the past there had already been a Zip violin projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposal... They are examples of what the engineers call "downconversion" When noise at the violin mode frequencies near multiples of Hz for LIGO isn't steady but varies in intensity at some lower frequencies some of these variations will show up in our spectrograms as additional noise near these lower frequencies. Thank you ZngabitanT and Nicm it all makes sense to me now! I should have asked this ages ago. I have heard about some of this before but not in relation to the observatories.  Viola? 743.60Hz  sb?  sb? Nearly mushrooms floating ones! Scattered light.  25sb This is all very interesting thank you for your thorough explanation as usual .

Do they have a name? Thank you and sorry to bother you with so many questions.  fireball koi   bliplet at 32hz Scattered light and low frequency line 23hz  fireballs  I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well. Ohhhh... sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button... Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts. They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones. I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet... Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness. Note the double tip at the top of the central shape.  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips... We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time 0. seconds provided it's recognizable . Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time. No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify. Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs. I'll just classify them as such for consistency. Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be. Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards. Now I need a new plan. Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad. I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order. My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago. I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information. Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes. I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections. I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches. Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI. What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible. It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house. I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O4. so there is no hurry for this information just yet. Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nic .

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. It is valuable to know if the citizen scientists are proposing new glitch classes. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class, the glitch class.

    2. If there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2, describe the questions and the reasoning for the question. These questions indicate dynamics in exploring and learning the classification of glitches by cititzen scientists.

    3. Does Talk data set 2 suggest new hypotheses about where glitch origins? What are these hypotheses and what is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? This suggests the potential of gained knowledge in the underlying causes of glitches and the potential factors contributing to their appearance in the data.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:
     This is an additional explanation I received. Hope it helps. From ZngabitanT Subject Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a seconds wide Gravity Spy subject. is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GW170817. It has been rendered at high Q 45. which brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subject's fourth frame and which doesn't do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the seconds mark. A low Q rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible. The very loud glitch just before time seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis. It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data. For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of and we're supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp.  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time 0. seconds or dominant at this time. This is mentioned in the FAQ projects zooniverse gravity spy about faq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it. In this way we help the Machine Learning to recognize e.g. a Whistle even when it is accompanied by Scattered Light or vice versa. Thank you for contributing!

I will put it with the bliplets in any case. Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the 'eiffel' that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction. I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed? ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of "baby Tomtes" intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets... and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call "lower frequency blips" meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what we've been calling "bliplets" of late . There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under and just over Hz mostly in the bins around and Hz where we're finding the bliplets too. Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3. Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between and 22. But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets. So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples! I've also started doing a little in this direction but it's done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnish run "top attached" kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow.  Thank you and happy what's now left of to you too!  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams. Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data .

Massive koi fireballs eiffel Nice overlapping pair here showing the effect of the different Q value choices... Among the rather noisy mess here there's a central Virgo O angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk dominating the scene corroborated by the Hz peak frequency with a weather vane projects zooniverse gravity spy talk embedded slightly later. This in itself is somewhat remarkable. While such angel weather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O it's the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll mode projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment damper was disabled . On a few dozen other occasions the 9. Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch. The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far. This subject was recorded on at some point between 05. and UTC. And from a mere 0. seconds later we have... ...the overlapping continuation S of S now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane. The interferometer stayed locked for another seconds or so and lost lock at 14. Science Mode was reestablished by 56. The plots attached to the night shift report https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isn't clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before and then simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at and then the IMC lock dropped. ! plots around the 29T lockloss https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png One of the ASC loops in question had its set point tuned https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r later on implying it hadn't been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost . We don't know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that haven't been included among these plots were doing at the time. I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be. It's got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss... I do have a few robust ideas what it can't be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots e.g. PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis. The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range. This was done https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r a little later on 29.  If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGO's DHARD and TX TY representing theta X theta Y are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively. Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT. MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesn't have the PR PR folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta .  Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further. There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later. It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook . Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop. The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others . And it can open without the Metatron Guardian level automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more . From the events of 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r it can't be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches. The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see from 13T UTC elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r . Wherever there's a BNS range plot available around the time in question e.g. see again 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last. But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 0. Mpc. Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode. A common feature of most of the pre lockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions "10Hz" or "9.5Hz" or "9.7Hz" oscillations... which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damper projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment . When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 19. Hz roll mode harmonics... only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 14. So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . In particular the loop we're looking for is not that of the damper itself. A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a picked off beam centered on a quadrant photodiode. The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop. The causal connections remain mysterious for now. West End 9. Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop. The relatively frequent weather vane angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk combinations together with the run of angel willow compound glitches from November and the fact that Willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injection input side of the interferometer. But that's not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too. By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadn't been what triggered the subject... What would this disturbance be classified as? It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin.  Well observed and a peculiar catch! It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses short duration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown. Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes. We've embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class. You'll find several relevant discussion threads e.g. in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass "bliplet" with an unusually abrupt transition from "body" to "tail" but I'm not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the "tail" above it.  laughing laughing laughing "and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow." I wasn't sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but it's the best classification I could find for it. Thanks Nicm I'm glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily! It's interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next.  Several scattered light among those.

It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips. There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when it's recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud. Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballs projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet. You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk !

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch and good question! The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole five minute run that Nicm has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like looking more like the former others like looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy tools https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like firmly on the LFB side. But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to at Hanford and prior to at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses. Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also don't involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question! The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count in steps of ten the different hues used to represent the noise energy levels from dark violet at for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25. for the most energetic parts of the glitch. These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than uhm that not very bright shade of turquoise". In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential arm length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy. Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. It probably originated as a compound of two or three near simultaneous small sort of blips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around and around Hz. Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search . 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end. Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes this is Scattered Light " la Virgo O3" and yes these can sometimes fail to look very arch like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to kHz for more than seconds although peaking at 21. Hz that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject. Running this through a similarity search https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search asking for results from Virgo era O produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well developed little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 0221 b 107d 46ee 859e e .png Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish are bright ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location f f 437b bc 5 .png Rows of arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 3b c 4 f 99e 22274071545a.png And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 2245 e 4 e fd 0 a a .png Putting all these possibilities together we may arrive at cases like the present subject. On a few rare occasions during O Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns . Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency causes optical resonance as glitches. timestamp 19T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page Livingston no recorded as glitches H1O3a 19T 38.

This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular. Long ago in a galaxy far away... uhm... well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now. Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits. And they aren't so easy to mis spell. And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips?   bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. Yes to start a new collection but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"?  fireball koi   fireball koi  Oh I'm sorry I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run. Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases. I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts . So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful.  bliplet at 49hz So "top attached blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the Hz. And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I will create such collection with this subject.

     That's what came to my mind first but most of the LFL are straight in frame and that's why I wasn't sure. Thanks I've added "Blip subclass blip" to my collections. Did not think this was violin because it appears to starting from a lower frequency in picture 4. Today we have violin and bass drum. It's subclass of violin.  Re S In relation to the shift report > BNS Range Mpc I thought that BNS was Binary Neutron Star and Mpc was megaparsec but I can understand this context. I could be totally wrong in my interpretation. Please can you explain what this means in simple terms! Thank you ZngabitanT  It shows noise level converted to Million light years. I think it was an indicator that even if merge event were to occur there it would still be detectable. discussion here projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2752251?comment  Thank you Nic . Very helpful.  Yes the current sensitivity of each of the GW observatories when it's up and running and able to collect science data is commonly expressed as the range in Megaparsecs from which a merger of two neutron stars could still be detected with adequate signal to noise ratio. The less instrumental noise the larger the BNS range. This is a figure of merit that's easily comparable between the different observatory sites and between different epochs at one and the same site as upgrades are made and noise sources come and go. Neutron stars rather than black holes are used for this purpose because they come in a limited range of masses between about 1. and less than solar masses and thus their mergers consistently produce gravitational waves at similar intensities within a factor of two or so they serve as "standard sirens" in analogy to the "standard candles" Cepheid variables supernovae of certain types... known from optical astronomy. Black holes come in a much larger range of sizes and their mergers produce GWs over a wide range of very different intensitities for a given distance . Stuff near the bottom edge of our spectrograms below Hz is often hard to classify for two reasons First there is very little information there to begin with. One second's worth of a steady sine wave shaped oscillation at Hz say corresponds to a mere ten crests and troughs and if such a sine wave isn't steady and varies in amplitude say half of the effect would end up out of sight below Hz. This aspect is where the additional context of surrounding subjects becomes helpful... Second the random background noise increases dramatically by several orders of magnitude! below about Hz towards the Hz bottom edge. We don't see this in our spectrograms the preprocessing equalizes it out making it look as if there was a constant amount of background noise at all frequencies. But in reality the top of for example a Scattered Light arch culminating at say Hz has to be much more intense to be visible above the background noise than the top of an arch culminating at say Hz and the flanks of the arches tend to get drowned out completely under the background at very low frequencies even when they have the same absolute intensity as the culminations . What's left for us to see may then look like a rounded LF Burst or like an elongated LF line depending on how long it lasted and depending on the Q value chosen to render the spectrogram. I reckon that most LFBs and LFLs arise in this way and in particular that most of the Hz "LF line" subjects from Livingston of which there are quite a few exist merely because there's so much background noise below Hz. Some might still originate in other ways. At any rate there hasn't been anything at Livingston known to genuinely oscillate at around Hz these LFLs aren't lines in the spectral line sense projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . There are some spectral lines at other low frequencies from periodically dithering the test mass mirrors by very small angles in both pitch and yaw as part of the alignment sensing and control but these produce stationary noise that's easily removed not transient noise that would show up as glitches. The LFB and LFL glitch classes are thus a compromise. They give us something to put subjects into when they sit at very low frequencies and when we can't make out any unambiguous arches but they don't necessarily coincide with specific glitch causes and noise coupling paths. And in the past there had already been a Zip violin projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposal... They are examples of what the engineers call "downconversion" When noise at the violin mode frequencies near multiples of Hz for LIGO isn't steady but varies in intensity at some lower frequencies some of these variations will show up in our spectrograms as additional noise near these lower frequencies. Thank you ZngabitanT and Nicm it all makes sense to me now! I should have asked this ages ago. I have heard about some of this before but not in relation to the observatories.

Do they have a name? Thank you and sorry to bother you with so many questions.  fireball koi   bliplet at 32hz Scattered light and low frequency line 23hz  fireballs  I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well. Ohhhh... sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button... Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts. They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones. I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet... Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness. Note the double tip at the top of the central shape.  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips... We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time 0. seconds provided it's recognizable . Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time. No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify. Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs. I'll just classify them as such for consistency. Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be. Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards. Now I need a new plan. Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad. I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order. My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago. I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information. Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes. I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections. I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches. Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI. What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible. It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house. I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O4. so there is no hurry for this information just yet. Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nic .

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. It is valuable to know if the citizen scientists are proposing new glitch classes. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class, the glitch class.

    2. If there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2, describe the questions and the reasoning for the question. I know they exploring and learning the classification of glitches by cititzen scientists. I am interested in what they want to learn.

    3. Does Talk data set 2 suggest new hypotheses about where glitch origins? What are these hypotheses and what is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? This suggests the potential of gained knowledge in the underlying mechanisms which cause glitches and their appearance in the data.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:
     This is an additional explanation I received. Hope it helps. From ZngabitanT Subject Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a seconds wide Gravity Spy subject. is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GW170817. It has been rendered at high Q 45. which brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subject's fourth frame and which doesn't do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the seconds mark. A low Q rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible. The very loud glitch just before time seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis. It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data. For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of and we're supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp.  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time 0. seconds or dominant at this time. This is mentioned in the FAQ projects zooniverse gravity spy about faq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it.

I will put it with the bliplets in any case. Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the 'eiffel' that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction. I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed? ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of "baby Tomtes" intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets... and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call "lower frequency blips" meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what we've been calling "bliplets" of late . There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under and just over Hz mostly in the bins around and Hz where we're finding the bliplets too. Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3. Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between and 22. But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets. So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples! I've also started doing a little in this direction but it's done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnish run "top attached" kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow.  Thank you and happy what's now left of to you too!  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams. Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data .

Massive koi fireballs eiffel Nice overlapping pair here showing the effect of the different Q value choices... Among the rather noisy mess here there's a central Virgo O angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk dominating the scene corroborated by the Hz peak frequency with a weather vane projects zooniverse gravity spy talk embedded slightly later. This in itself is somewhat remarkable. While such angel weather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O it's the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll mode projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment damper was disabled . On a few dozen other occasions the 9. Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch. The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far. This subject was recorded on at some point between 05. and UTC. And from a mere 0. seconds later we have... ...the overlapping continuation S of S now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane. The interferometer stayed locked for another seconds or so and lost lock at 14. Science Mode was reestablished by 56. The plots attached to the night shift report https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isn't clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before and then simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at and then the IMC lock dropped. ! plots around the 29T lockloss https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png One of the ASC loops in question had its set point tuned https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r later on implying it hadn't been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost . We don't know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that haven't been included among these plots were doing at the time. I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be. It's got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss... I do have a few robust ideas what it can't be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots e.g. PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis. The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range. This was done https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r a little later on 29.  If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGO's DHARD and TX TY representing theta X theta Y are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively. Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT. MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesn't have the PR PR folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta .  Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further. There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later. It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook . Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop. The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others . And it can open without the Metatron Guardian level automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more . From the events of 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r it can't be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches. The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see from 13T UTC elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r . Wherever there's a BNS range plot available around the time in question e.g. see again 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last. But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 0. Mpc. Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode. A common feature of most of the pre lockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions "10Hz" or "9.5Hz" or "9.7Hz" oscillations... which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damper projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment . When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 19. Hz roll mode harmonics... only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 14. So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . In particular the loop we're looking for is not that of the damper itself. A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a picked off beam centered on a quadrant photodiode. The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop. The causal connections remain mysterious for now. West End 9. Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop. The relatively frequent weather vane angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk combinations together with the run of angel willow compound glitches from November and the fact that Willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injection input side of the interferometer. But that's not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too. By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadn't been what triggered the subject... What would this disturbance be classified as? It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin.  Well observed and a peculiar catch! It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses short duration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown. Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes. We've embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class. You'll find several relevant discussion threads e.g. in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass "bliplet" with an unusually abrupt transition from "body" to "tail" but I'm not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the "tail" above it.  laughing laughing laughing "and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow." I wasn't sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but it's the best classification I could find for it. Thanks Nicm I'm glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily! It's interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next.  Several scattered light among those.

CPwoSQP z  What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips. There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when it's recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud. Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballs projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet. You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk !

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch and good question! The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole five minute run that Nicm has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like looking more like the former others like looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy tools https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like firmly on the LFB side. But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to at Hanford and prior to at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses. Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also don't involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question! The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count in steps of ten the different hues used to represent the noise energy levels from dark violet at for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25. for the most energetic parts of the glitch. These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than uhm that not very bright shade of turquoise". In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential arm length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy. Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. It probably originated as a compound of two or three near simultaneous small sort of blips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around and around Hz. Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search . 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end. Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes this is Scattered Light " la Virgo O3" and yes these can sometimes fail to look very arch like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to kHz for more than seconds although peaking at 21. Hz that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject. Running this through a similarity search https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search asking for results from Virgo era O produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well developed little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 0221 b 107d 46ee 859e e .png Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish are bright ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location f f 437b bc 5 .png Rows of arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 3b c 4 f 99e 22274071545a.png And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 2245 e 4 e fd 0 a a .png Putting all these possibilities together we may arrive at cases like the present subject. On a few rare occasions during O Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns . Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency causes optical resonance as glitches. timestamp 19T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page Livingston no recorded as glitches H1O3a 19T 38.

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet?  Nicm I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q.  blip plus what looks like crowns at Q in frames and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular. Long ago in a galaxy far away... uhm... well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now. Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits. And they aren't so easy to mis spell. And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips?   bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. Yes to start a new collection but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"?  fireball koi   fireball koi  Oh I'm sorry I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run. Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases. I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts . So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful.  bliplet at 49hz So "top attached blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the Hz. And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I will create such collection with this subject.

     That's what came to my mind first but most of the LFL are straight in frame and that's why I wasn't sure. Thanks I've added "Blip subclass blip" to my collections. Did not think this was violin because it appears to starting from a lower frequency in picture 4. Today we have violin and bass drum. It's subclass of violin.  Re S In relation to the shift report > BNS Range Mpc I thought that BNS was Binary Neutron Star and Mpc was megaparsec but I can understand this context. I could be totally wrong in my interpretation. Please can you explain what this means in simple terms! Thank you ZngabitanT  It shows noise level converted to Million light years. I think it was an indicator that even if merge event were to occur there it would still be detectable. discussion here projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2752251?comment  Thank you Nic . Very helpful.  Yes the current sensitivity of each of the GW observatories when it's up and running and able to collect science data is commonly expressed as the range in Megaparsecs from which a merger of two neutron stars could still be detected with adequate signal to noise ratio. The less instrumental noise the larger the BNS range. This is a figure of merit that's easily comparable between the different observatory sites and between different epochs at one and the same site as upgrades are made and noise sources come and go. Neutron stars rather than black holes are used for this purpose because they come in a limited range of masses between about 1. and less than solar masses and thus their mergers consistently produce gravitational waves at similar intensities within a factor of two or so they serve as "standard sirens" in analogy to the "standard candles" Cepheid variables supernovae of certain types... known from optical astronomy. Black holes come in a much larger range of sizes and their mergers produce GWs over a wide range of very different intensitities for a given distance . Stuff near the bottom edge of our spectrograms below Hz is often hard to classify for two reasons First there is very little information there to begin with. One second's worth of a steady sine wave shaped oscillation at Hz say corresponds to a mere ten crests and troughs and if such a sine wave isn't steady and varies in amplitude say half of the effect would end up out of sight below Hz. This aspect is where the additional context of surrounding subjects becomes helpful... Second the random background noise increases dramatically by several orders of magnitude! below about Hz towards the Hz bottom edge. We don't see this in our spectrograms the preprocessing equalizes it out making it look as if there was a constant amount of background noise at all frequencies. But in reality the top of for example a Scattered Light arch culminating at say Hz has to be much more intense to be visible above the background noise than the top of an arch culminating at say Hz and the flanks of the arches tend to get drowned out completely under the background at very low frequencies even when they have the same absolute intensity as the culminations . What's left for us to see may then look like a rounded LF Burst or like an elongated LF line depending on how long it lasted and depending on the Q value chosen to render the spectrogram. I reckon that most LFBs and LFLs arise in this way and in particular that most of the Hz "LF line" subjects from Livingston of which there are quite a few exist merely because there's so much background noise below Hz. Some might still originate in other ways. At any rate there hasn't been anything at Livingston known to genuinely oscillate at around Hz these LFLs aren't lines in the spectral line sense projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . There are some spectral lines at other low frequencies from periodically dithering the test mass mirrors by very small angles in both pitch and yaw as part of the alignment sensing and control but these produce stationary noise that's easily removed not transient noise that would show up as glitches. The LFB and LFL glitch classes are thus a compromise. They give us something to put subjects into when they sit at very low frequencies and when we can't make out any unambiguous arches but they don't necessarily coincide with specific glitch causes and noise coupling paths. And in the past there had already been a Zip violin projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposal... They are examples of what the engineers call "downconversion" When noise at the violin mode frequencies near multiples of Hz for LIGO isn't steady but varies in intensity at some lower frequencies some of these variations will show up in our spectrograms as additional noise near these lower frequencies. Thank you ZngabitanT and Nicm it all makes sense to me now! I should have asked this ages ago. I have heard about some of this before but not in relation to the observatories.  Viola? 743.60Hz  sb?  sb? Nearly mushrooms floating ones! Scattered light.  25sb This is all very interesting thank you for your thorough explanation as usual .

Do they have a name? Thank you and sorry to bother you with so many questions.  fireball koi   bliplet at 32hz Scattered light and low frequency line 23hz  fireballs  I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well. Ohhhh... sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button... Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts. They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones. I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet... Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness. Note the double tip at the top of the central shape.  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips... We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time 0. seconds provided it's recognizable . Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time. No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify. Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs. I'll just classify them as such for consistency. Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be. Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards. Now I need a new plan. Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad. I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order. My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago. I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information. Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes. I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections. I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches. Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI. What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible. It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house. I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O4. so there is no hurry for this information just yet. Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nic .

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to explore and learn classifications of glitches by cititzen scientists. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe the questions and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. Does Talk data set 2 suggest new hypotheses about where glitch origins? What are these hypotheses and what is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? This suggests the potential of gained knowledge in the underlying mechanisms which cause glitches and their appearance in the data.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:
     This is an additional explanation I received. Hope it helps. From ZngabitanT Subject Yes more than one thing can happen at nearly the same time and thus more than one thing can be present within a seconds wide Gravity Spy subject. is centered on the end of the binary neutron star chirp GW170817. It has been rendered at high Q 45. which brings out the gradual rise in frequency over the course of the left half of the subject's fourth frame and which doesn't do justice to the brief steep upturn at the end so the curve appears to peter out a little before the seconds mark. A low Q rendering would have highlighted this final moment but most of the gradual curve leading in to it would then have become invisible. The very loud glitch just before time seconds just happened to happen at that moment and it was quite a nuisance for the data analysis. It needed to be very carefully modeled so that it could be subtracted from the raw data. For classification purposes in Gravity Spy however it is not the central feature of and we're supposed to ignore it and focus on the chirp.  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! When glitches of different types appear together in the same subject by coincidence we would focus on the glitch closest to time 0. seconds or dominant at this time. This is mentioned in the FAQ projects zooniverse gravity spy about faq but you have to scroll about two thirds of the way down the FAQ page to find it. In this way we help the Machine Learning to recognize e.g. a Whistle even when it is accompanied by Scattered Light or vice versa. Thank you for contributing!

I will put it with the bliplets in any case. Thank you  Although rather pretty in the context pf the GS logo the 'eiffel' that coincides with the gravity wave has been a distraction. I know that this is asking a lot has anyone tried successfully to prepare a picture of the GW curve from which the eiffel has been removed? ZngabitanT There seems to be a population of "baby Tomtes" intermediate in size between fully formed triangular Tomtes and bliplets... and I understand the engineers are still scratching their heads over whether there is any relationship between Tomtes and what they call "lower frequency blips" meaning small blips with peak frequencies below 50Hz a separate class in the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component which has no counterpart in Zooniverse Gravity Spy yet but which seems to correspond approximately to what we've been calling "bliplets" of late . There are some commonalities Tomtes are getting reported at peak frequencies between just under and just over Hz mostly in the bins around and Hz where we're finding the bliplets too. Both Tomtes and bliplets have been much more common at Livingston than at Hanford during O3. Hanford seems to have had an episode featuring both between and 22. But the causal chains ending up with the glitches we get to see are probably not the same for Tomtes and bliplets. So thank you both for rounding up and collecting ever more examples! I've also started doing a little in this direction but it's done as part of getting a handle on all the other potential Blip subclasses the numerous ordinary blips and the varnish run "top attached" kind and the droplets and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow.  Thank you and happy what's now left of to you too!  Yes indeed and the cleaning of the data has been important enough that it has been done more than once independently by different teams. Note that what the astrophysicists need is a cleaned version of the raw waveform data .

Massive koi fireballs eiffel Nice overlapping pair here showing the effect of the different Q value choices... Among the rather noisy mess here there's a central Virgo O angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk dominating the scene corroborated by the Hz peak frequency with a weather vane projects zooniverse gravity spy talk embedded slightly later. This in itself is somewhat remarkable. While such angel weather vane combinations are relatively common although both kinds of glitches are comparatively rare in Virgo O it's the first time I see a weather vane recorded on a day when the oscillation prone West End payload roll mode projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment damper was disabled . On a few dozen other occasions the 9. Hz oscillations caused by the flawed damper may have contributed to triggering a weather vane glitch. The precise causal connection if any remains unknown so far. This subject was recorded on at some point between 05. and UTC. And from a mere 0. seconds later we have... ...the overlapping continuation S of S now triggered by some part of the lower frequency noise around Hz thus neither by the angel nor by the weather vane. The interferometer stayed locked for another seconds or so and lost lock at 14. Science Mode was reestablished by 56. The plots attached to the night shift report https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r show angular oscillations in some of the alignment sensing and control ASC loops but it isn't clear to what extent these channels had been fluctuating already before and then simultaneous bumps in the Michelson parameter and PRC length at and then the IMC lock dropped. ! plots around the 29T lockloss https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo uploads plot 202019.png One of the ASC loops in question had its set point tuned https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r later on implying it hadn't been optimally tuned at the time the lock was lost . We don't know what all the other control loops and auxiliary channels that haven't been included among these plots were doing at the time. I rather think there ought to be at least one channel witnessing the weather vane glitches but so far I have no idea what it might be. It's got to have something to do with some feedback loop that can suddenly open without immediately causing a lockloss... I do have a few robust ideas what it can't be based on other examples tied to other logbook entries with plots e.g. PSTAB and SSFS the loops stabilizing the injected laser power and wavelength have solid alibis. The night shift report also mentions that the vertical actuation of the second suspended detection bench SDB needed adjusting so as not to exceed its operating range. This was done https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r a little later on 29.  If someone from LIGO is reading this and puzzling about the terminology of the plotted channels what Virgo calls DIFF in publications and DIFFp in channel names corresponds to LIGO's DHARD and TX TY representing theta X theta Y are the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom respectively. Similarly COMM or COMMp CHARD DIFF or DIFFm DSOFT COMM or COMMm CSOFT. MICH and PRCL are the same everywhere but Virgo doesn't have the PR PR folding mirrors so all PR corrections go to the PR mirror itself and to its penultimate suspension stage marionetta .  Thank you ZngabitanT for this detailed explanation for future readers and for those interested into looking further. There is indeed a rich documentation at our fingertips  Revisiting this topic with twenty additional months of hindsight under the belt It is obvious from the appearance of the weather vane glitches that they must come from some kind of loop suddenly opening and then gradually regaining control a fraction of a second later or several seconds later. It can regain control faster than could be explained by human intervention and in any case human interventions would have left some trail in the logbook . Thus some kind of automation is managing the loop. The loop can open without immediately causing a lockloss which rules out all of Length Sensing and Control and many others . And it can open without the Metatron Guardian level automation concluding that the look should be dropped which rules out a few more . From the events of 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r it can't be the PSTAB loop nor does SSFS witness these glitches. The PSTAB loop can open without causing a lockloss and such an event looks somewhat similar to a weather vane but much more dramatic see from 13T UTC elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r . Wherever there's a BNS range plot available around the time in question e.g. see again 15T UTC and elog https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r weather vane glitches correspond to significant range drops while they last. But not as dramatic as the few minutes in Science Mode with open PSTAB loop on when there was no useful sensitivity left at all and the BNS range dropped to 0. Mpc. Weather vanes have been occurring shortly before a lockloss or in the middle of a lock stretch or surprisingly a few minutes after recovering from a lockloss and regaining Science Mode. A common feature of most of the pre lockloss weather vanes is that the logbook mentions "10Hz" or "9.5Hz" or "9.7Hz" oscillations... which can invariably be traced to the finicky West End payload roll mode damper projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2626575?comment . When the damper was finally stabilized by the intervention on https logbook.virgo gw.eu virgo ?r fixing a bug in the OB vertical control that had been adversely interacting with the damper the weather vanes stopped for a while along with the 19. Hz roll mode harmonics... only for both to reappear on a few later occasions notably on 14. So far there is only one example of a weather vane recorded on a day when the WE payload roll mode damper was disabled see projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . In particular the loop we're looking for is not that of the damper itself. A plausible working hypothesis then might be that it is a loop or possibly more than one which controls one of the many auxiliary degrees of freedom such as the position and alignment of a suspended bench or a galvo loop keeping a picked off beam centered on a quadrant photodiode. The glitches may be happening whenever something else has wandered far enough off the good working point to saturate the poor loop. The causal connections remain mysterious for now. West End 9. Hz roll mode oscillations may not have been directly affecting the hypothetical loop they might for example have been causing alignment fluctuations which could also occasionally happen for other reasons and which then tripped up said loop. The relatively frequent weather vane angel projects zooniverse gravity spy talk combinations together with the run of angel willow compound glitches from November and the fact that Willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are known to come from the laser amplifiers inside the PSTAB loop make it somewhat likely that both angel glitches and weather vanes originate somewhere south of the beam splitter on the injection input side of the interferometer. But that's not completely conclusive and so far the causes for angel glitches remain unknown too. By the way we may yet have just enough examples to justify a glitch class proposal for weather vanes under Gravity Spy rules if we bend the rules to allow subjects where a weather vane is present but the metadata prove that it hadn't been what triggered the subject... What would this disturbance be classified as? It looks most similar to a blip but the tail is abnormally thin.  Well observed and a peculiar catch! It could be called a Blip in the widest sense the Blip class encompasses short duration broadband glitches varying widely in appearance coming from multiple independent causes which are mostly still unknown. Or None Of The Above which is always an option when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes. We've embarked only in the last several months on an investigation of possible subclasses of the Blip class. You'll find several relevant discussion threads e.g. in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . The present glitch might pass for a Blip of the subclass "bliplet" with an unusually abrupt transition from "body" to "tail" but I'm not quite sure about it it might be a blend of two separate coincident glitches a round kind of bliplet and some other noise providing the "tail" above it.  laughing laughing laughing "and the sardines and the sardines' rare cousins which I'm thinking of as anchovies... so my own progress on the bliplet front is rather slow." I wasn't sure this subject qualified as a bliplet but it's the best classification I could find for it. Thanks Nicm I'm glad you wrote the program to help you find the timestamps so easily! It's interesting to see the progression from one subject to the next.  Several scattered light among those.

CPwoSQP z  What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips. There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when it's recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud. Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballs projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet. You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collections projects zooniverse gravity spy talk !

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch and good question! The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole five minute run that Nicm has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like looking more like the former others like looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy tools https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like firmly on the LFB side. But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to at Hanford and prior to at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses. Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also don't involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question! The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count in steps of ten the different hues used to represent the noise energy levels from dark violet at for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25. for the most energetic parts of the glitch. These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than uhm that not very bright shade of turquoise". In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential arm length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy. Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. It probably originated as a compound of two or three near simultaneous small sort of blips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around and around Hz. Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search . 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end. Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes this is Scattered Light " la Virgo O3" and yes these can sometimes fail to look very arch like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to kHz for more than seconds although peaking at 21. Hz that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject. Running this through a similarity search https gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu search asking for results from Virgo era O produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well developed little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 0221 b 107d 46ee 859e e .png Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish are bright ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location f f 437b bc 5 .png Rows of arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 3b c 4 f 99e 22274071545a.png And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening ! frame https thumbnails.zooniverse.org 300x panoptes uploads.zooniverse.org subject location 2245 e 4 e fd 0 a a .png Putting all these possibilities together we may arrive at cases like the present subject. On a few rare occasions during O Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns . Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency causes optical resonance as glitches. timestamp 19T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page Livingston no recorded as glitches H1O3a 19T 38.

This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular. Long ago in a galaxy far away... uhm... well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now. Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits. And they aren't so easy to mis spell. And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips?   bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. Yes to start a new collection but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"?  fireball koi   fireball koi  Oh I'm sorry I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run. Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases. I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts . So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful.  bliplet at 49hz So "top attached blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the Hz. And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I will create such collection with this subject.

     That's what came to my mind first but most of the LFL are straight in frame and that's why I wasn't sure. Thanks I've added "Blip subclass blip" to my collections. Did not think this was violin because it appears to starting from a lower frequency in picture 4. Today we have violin and bass drum. It's subclass of violin.  Re S In relation to the shift report > BNS Range Mpc I thought that BNS was Binary Neutron Star and Mpc was megaparsec but I can understand this context. I could be totally wrong in my interpretation. Please can you explain what this means in simple terms! Thank you ZngabitanT  It shows noise level converted to Million light years. I think it was an indicator that even if merge event were to occur there it would still be detectable. discussion here projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2752251?comment  Thank you Nic . Very helpful.  Yes the current sensitivity of each of the GW observatories when it's up and running and able to collect science data is commonly expressed as the range in Megaparsecs from which a merger of two neutron stars could still be detected with adequate signal to noise ratio. The less instrumental noise the larger the BNS range. This is a figure of merit that's easily comparable between the different observatory sites and between different epochs at one and the same site as upgrades are made and noise sources come and go. Neutron stars rather than black holes are used for this purpose because they come in a limited range of masses between about 1. and less than solar masses and thus their mergers consistently produce gravitational waves at similar intensities within a factor of two or so they serve as "standard sirens" in analogy to the "standard candles" Cepheid variables supernovae of certain types... known from optical astronomy. Black holes come in a much larger range of sizes and their mergers produce GWs over a wide range of very different intensitities for a given distance . Stuff near the bottom edge of our spectrograms below Hz is often hard to classify for two reasons First there is very little information there to begin with. One second's worth of a steady sine wave shaped oscillation at Hz say corresponds to a mere ten crests and troughs and if such a sine wave isn't steady and varies in amplitude say half of the effect would end up out of sight below Hz. This aspect is where the additional context of surrounding subjects becomes helpful... Second the random background noise increases dramatically by several orders of magnitude! below about Hz towards the Hz bottom edge. We don't see this in our spectrograms the preprocessing equalizes it out making it look as if there was a constant amount of background noise at all frequencies. But in reality the top of for example a Scattered Light arch culminating at say Hz has to be much more intense to be visible above the background noise than the top of an arch culminating at say Hz and the flanks of the arches tend to get drowned out completely under the background at very low frequencies even when they have the same absolute intensity as the culminations . What's left for us to see may then look like a rounded LF Burst or like an elongated LF line depending on how long it lasted and depending on the Q value chosen to render the spectrogram. I reckon that most LFBs and LFLs arise in this way and in particular that most of the Hz "LF line" subjects from Livingston of which there are quite a few exist merely because there's so much background noise below Hz. Some might still originate in other ways. At any rate there hasn't been anything at Livingston known to genuinely oscillate at around Hz these LFLs aren't lines in the spectral line sense projects zooniverse gravity spy talk . There are some spectral lines at other low frequencies from periodically dithering the test mass mirrors by very small angles in both pitch and yaw as part of the alignment sensing and control but these produce stationary noise that's easily removed not transient noise that would show up as glitches. The LFB and LFL glitch classes are thus a compromise. They give us something to put subjects into when they sit at very low frequencies and when we can't make out any unambiguous arches but they don't necessarily coincide with specific glitch causes and noise coupling paths. And in the past there had already been a Zip violin projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposal... They are examples of what the engineers call "downconversion" When noise at the violin mode frequencies near multiples of Hz for LIGO isn't steady but varies in intensity at some lower frequencies some of these variations will show up in our spectrograms as additional noise near these lower frequencies. Thank you ZngabitanT and Nicm it all makes sense to me now! I should have asked this ages ago. I have heard about some of this before but not in relation to the observatories.

Do they have a name? Thank you and sorry to bother you with so many questions.  fireball koi   bliplet at 32hz Scattered light and low frequency line 23hz  fireballs  I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well. Ohhhh... sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button... Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts. They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones. I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet... Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness. Note the double tip at the top of the central shape.  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips... We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time 0. seconds provided it's recognizable . Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time. No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify. Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs. I'll just classify them as such for consistency. Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be. Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards. Now I need a new plan. Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad. I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order. My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago. I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information. Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes. I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections. I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches. Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI. What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible. It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house. I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O4. so there is no hurry for this information just yet. Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nic .

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. Does Talk data set 2 suggest new hypotheses about where glitch origins? What are these hypotheses and what is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? This suggests the potential of gained knowledge in the underlying mechanisms which cause glitches and their appearance in the data.

This glitch class is described as a subclass of blips with an unusually abrupt transition from "body" to "tail", potentially a blend of two separate coincident glitches. This class is identified as a borderline case, where the top extends to Hz but appears blue or bluish, leading to its classification as a "borderline varnish run blip."\n\n2. **Emerging Questions:** In Talk data set 2, there are emerging questions related to the classifications of glitches, sensors, and gravitational wave science. One question raised is regarding the units for the normalized energy in the spectrograms and the significance of brightness levels in classifying glitches. Another question pertains to the origin of specific glitch shapes, such as violin modes and bass drum modes, and how they are detected and differentiated from other glitches. These questions suggest a deeper curiosity and exploration into the intricacies of glitch classification and their underlying causes.\n\n3. **New Hypotheses about Glitch Origins:** Talk data set 2 suggests new hypotheses about the origins of glitches, particularly focusing on the variations in noise levels and frequencies that can lead to the appearance of different glitch types. One hypothesis proposed is that certain glitches arise from variations in noise at specific frequencies, such as violin mode frequencies near multiples of Hz. These hypotheses stem from observations of the spectrograms and the patterns of noise fluctuations at different frequencies, indicating a deeper understanding of how noise sources impact glitch appearances in the data.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713487289, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_d9767fc5b9', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=346, prompt_tokens=14614, total_tokens=14960))

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:
     I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well  Ohhhh sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet  Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness Note the double tip at the top of the central shape  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time seconds provided it's recognizable Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs I'll just classify them as such for consistency Thanks a lot!

Also I was able to download the excel file I normally just view then print to work on the search results and save it to Numbers It a start I have a long way to go but I am extremely grateful for what I have just learned from you It all a huge learning curve for me Thank you  Good morning mitchnanny glad to hear so I know you will be able to take what you need from my explanation and start your learning curve Take a look at the Apple tutorial I referenced above their guides use screenshots and it seems well explained While office management software has evolved much in the past decades they still keep the basic functions Regards You mean the image for the second frame was incomplete when it got shown to you? That could happen fortunately very rarely when the image file transmission from the Zooniverse cloud servers to your browser got stuck or got disrupted for some reason The file itself is OK showing a normal image to me now  This is Scattered Light la Virgo O Only the tops of the arches are bright enough to show up well and here the high Q processing has further stretched them horizontally and further subdued the flanks But the overall arrangement is characteristic  I'm not quite sure what it is either It could be a high Q rendering of an HFB or somewhat less likely an isolated brighter spot in a very faint whistle Calling it NOTA when neither option looks convincing is a safe alternative  There is a proposed glitch class for this whistle variant Gnarly Whistle projects zooniverse gravity spy talk so they can also be classified as None Of The Above while the proposal is pending For once the nickname had been given by the LIGO engineers themselves not by our volunteer community  Wonderful mitchnanny I am so happy that I could be of help and yours is a great starting point Allow me to suggest a learning approach You may resume re learning spreadsheets by creating yourself a simple file with just two or three columns in a tab filled with some words and numbers Then practise adding removing sorting searching renaming painting all the basic actions Then add another tab fill it in and try searching the whole spreadsheet for a number or word Then continue with very small sim searches results downloaded so that you feel in control of the sheet while mastering already the basic functions One step at a time my friend! The subsequent extremely loud noise associated with the lockloss in S has produced extensive data processing artefacts across the whole minute long data segment from which the spectrograms for these three Hanford subjects were produced The blips in S and in the present S are taller than they look they are half hidden behind the dark artefact bands This is best visible when looking at the fourth frames using the "half moon" button to toggle between normal and inverted colours also helps The relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions the lockloss but provides no further details about what caused it  Thank you Coralbell I will definitely have a few practise spreadsheets I will have to sort out some sort of filing system It is a bit fiddly on the iPad You mention adding the bar graph with the sim searches Does that have to be done via Imgur? I hope the answer is no !  Gladfully no haha! There must be an "Insert image" or similar function on your iPad spreadsheet Simply save the histogram image from GS to your device and then use the spreadsheet function to add it on your sheet  I downloaded the dataset from here BUT I doubt there are some instances in the "Extremely Loud" class that are misclassified !

I have never used a spreadsheet in a work situation We barely had computers when I was working many years ago BBC and MSDos before Windows came along   > don't let Coralbell scare you into buying a desktop computer Heaven forbid I only said access to  Meanwhile I've been having a look at the five subjects of which the character uniqueid hash code is readable in the screenshot A fun exercise the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search can be used to look up the corresponding Zooniverse subject numbers and to extract some other relevant information They all are extremely loud There's no misclassification but there are two other factors involved One is that the original training sets were created based on glitches from the first observing run with the intention of capturing the major glitch classes from that era The observatories have been repeatedly upgraded since and the glitch mix has changed a lot since then The other is that there had been an issue which has been fixed in the meantime with the creation of spectrogram images in certain situations ending up with some images that look uniformly dark violet even though they were triggered by events that were as loud as it gets To be more specific ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 9712b f c 9 b c b png 180x ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 2008bfa 9b fb 264 d f png 180x ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 527984db 30c 4 c df 6 eed png 180x S0MMl bvb S7CK1ypNMp and SDDrjeHB4o all share some traits with the Koi Fish class but are much larger from the Hz top edge to the Hz bottom edge than the typical Koi Fish glitches from the first observing run and more complex note the multiple peaks in rapid succession just under the top edge and they all have signal to background noise ratios that are way above a thousand At the time they were chosen to represent among other subjects the Extremely Loud class they were considered too extreme to fit into the same class as the much smaller Koi Fish glitches from that period And they are rather unlikely to have been caused in the same way At the present time having looked at tens of thousands of glitch subjects from the more recent observing runs we might consider them fringe cases of the Koi Fish class or we might consider them examples of a specific subclass that could be further characterized whereas Extremely Loud no longer feels like a very useful classification for them being a catch all for all sorts of very loud things that don't easily fit anywhere else But that's from hindsight there was no way the researchers could have foreseen in early what glitches would occur between and and how the original glitch classes might later want to be modified ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 74bf db 0 d 98dc 6 fce png sB tvsDa came from a lockloss projects zooniverse gravity spy talk on at UTC mentioned in the shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 374bf c e 4b d 4 d png SdEhuzKVOJ represents a lockloss on at UTC likewise mentioned in the shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep In both cases the image is almost but not entirely dark look closely at the right edge and in particular at the bottom right corner of the fourth frame! What happened there is that the immense amount of noise just past the right edge upset the preprocessing whitening algorithm acting on the minute long data segment from which the seconds wide spectrograms were extracted The strain channel was already extremely noisy at time seconds but it then got a whole lot noisier over the next few seconds by several orders of magnitude and the algorithms used at the time reacted by producing very small numbers and very dark spectrogram colors for the seconds window we get to see This was pointed out a while later apropos of a similar subject from the second observing run the first use of the zerosignal hashtag in Gravity Spy Talk one of the comments there provides some further explanation projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 466268?comment Training the Machine Learning to recognize such nearly zero signal spectrograms as originating from events that truly are extremely loud it can't get any worse than the interferometer losing the lock! had been useful at the time even though it looks confusing at first glance to our human eyes Hope this sheds some light on the matter!  O Must resist temptation to mention punched cards on the TR  No access to one that I would be able to use for this That the beauty of the iPad it is always beside me ready for whatever comes next so I really want to make it work for this but it isn easy Mind you I won be doing cascading sim searches for some time yet so I will go back to my old much quicker ways with my bliplets I have learned a lot today and spent hours doing this At least I know I can download an excel file from a sim search to Numbers and add the graph I just mustn forget to create a zoo collection as well Enough!!! Thank you dear mitchnanny I am confident you will find yor way and am so glad again to hear that you learnt this much today  Hmmm it was too difficult to scour usual major giant corporate software instruction manuals and imagine what I needed todo to figure out steps to get necessary files and data together Best help possible for me was to create Linux like batch file assuming I wanted to process some data in shell scripts I was just a kid then as can be imagined in the days before release of Windows we picked it up from junk and built various ecosystems to use up last of computer's life and here we are today What now replaced spreadsheet was direct use of Relational DataBase engine a GNU software suite of traditional SQL language with no additional licensing required for older software manual sheets are still paper based no need to download huge PDFs using a paid internet connection and operating procedures have not changed from then to now This is biggest advantage we can continue to have all users process something in exactly the same way I'm envisioned discussing various glitched data using exactly same results in those ways!

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes! It involves a lot of tapping provided you have the correct bit highlighted Thank you Coralbell I have printed out the instructions I couldn find anything about it yesterday At least I know it can be done in Numbers I actually have all my sim searches for my main two collections kept as printouts in folders As I go on I get more organised with them so if necessary I can go back to them I cross reference from my index cards It only in the last few months I have been cascading or I imagine I have looking for raindrop and fly bliplets so have dozens of printouts  True Also the present subject is the only one from the group above that was rendered at  Oops I did forget sigh don't know what I was thinking about Thank you so much for reminding me and also for proposing the "blip subclass blip" Without your reference subjects and description I would have only added to the collection subjects that were taller than Hz  Blip and small fireball  fireball koi   sprites  repeating koi   bliplet at 40hz Glad to hear that you could find it and keeping the instructions handy is always a good idea Both links I sent you along this conversation refer to Numbers User Guide for iPad https support apple com guide numbers ipad welcome ipados There is a Table of Contents covering different help topics which could serve as a useful reference in the future I am sorry that I do not own an iPad to give you specific answers for that device but I am happy to share any knowledge I might have to help you sort things out  You have been amazingly helpful Coralbell All this must have taken you away from your own important work Thank you  Sorry about the confusion ZngabitanT and glad that you referenced my paragraph where I mention Droplet so that the differences are sorted out and now we welcome Mackerel to the Blip family!

rectangular time frequency regions between a lower and a higher frequency and between a start and end time and computes the amount of noise or sometimes real GW signal intensity when a GW comes along that's present within each rectangle Any rectangle where the noise level exceeds a predetermined threshold and which are not contained within a larger rectangle that's also noisy above the threshold get called out by Omicron as "triggers" Well it doesn't actually shout of course it writes out a brief description of what it thought it had found to a file This description includes the event time the middle point of the rectangle's extent in time the moment in time that gets mapped to " seconds" in our subject images and the central frequency in Hz the middle of the rectangle in the frequency direction but on a linear scale just taking the average of lower and upper bounding frequency of the rectangle so we know where the rectangle was It includes the width of the rectangle along the time axis as the duration in seconds and the height of the rectangle along the frequency axis as the bandwidth again expressed in Hz Thus central frequency minus half the bandwidth recovers the lower bounding frequency of the rectangle and central frequency plus half the bandwidth gives the upper bounding frequency So we also know how large the rectangle was Blips will often get reported in tall rectangles of short duration "line" glitches in long duration rectangles spanning only a small bandwidth of frequencies But Omicron quite often reports an even larger rectangle for reasons that aren't always obvious Sometimes it's because of additional noise between and kHz that we don't get to see So the reported duration and bandwidth values need to be taken with a grain of salt The preceding do not yet imply anything about the shape and intensity of the glitch contained in the rectangle Imagine a three dimensional model time by frequency by noise intensity where the noise intensity sticks out of the screen Our colour scheme from dark violet to bright yellow is then a measure of how far it sticks out as in a map of a mountain landscape where colours represent altitude The peak frequency is approximately the frequency where the highest peak of this mountain is located where the mountain of noise sticks the most out of the screen But it's not exact it's more like merely naming just the grid square on an Ordnance Survey map inside which the true peak is located That's the "binning" we've been discussing And the snr signal to background noise ratio is a measure of how tall the peak is how far it sticks out of the screen It's useful for finding duplicates because it's computed from the raw data which are never exactly equal for two different glitches in a way that doesn't involve any discrete binning "Tallest peak" means tallest within the particular trigger rectangle that Omicron was reporting not tallest within the whole seconds wide and 2Khz tall region that later gets rendered as a Gravity Spy spectrogram image There may be more than one trigger rectangle within the same spectrogram region and the other glitches may have peaks that are even taller than the glitch around time seconds that was responsible for the trigger Such as the very loud glitch on the left side "stage right" in the Gravity Spy logo image And occasionally we end up with a rather dark area around seconds flanked by bright yellow on both sides Omicron sometimes regards groups of glitchlets as one single glitch that gets reported as one single noisy rectangle and then it's possible for the central time to fall in the middle between two or more glitchlets noise peaks Finally the similarity score does not come from Omicron and is not a property of the single glitch subject it's a measure how closely a subject resembles the given one that was used to start the search means they're the same glitch would be as dissimilar as possible In the DYCWMI tool this column remains empty since it would be meaningless In order for a broadband connection to deliver a high bandwidth in the bytes second sense it needs to use a sufficiently broad range of frequencies for the underlying physical signals on the wire so in that sense it's analogous Hope this helps!

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. Does Talk data set 2 suggest new hypotheses about where glitch origins? What are these hypotheses and what is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? This suggests the potential of gained knowledge in the underlying mechanisms which cause glitches and their appearance in the data.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:
     I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well  Ohhhh sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet  Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness Note the double tip at the top of the central shape  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time seconds provided it's recognizable Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs I'll just classify them as such for consistency Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards Now I need a new plan Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O so there is no hurry for this information just yet Thank you!

Also I was able to download the excel file I normally just view then print to work on the search results and save it to Numbers It a start I have a long way to go but I am extremely grateful for what I have just learned from you It all a huge learning curve for me Thank you  Good morning mitchnanny glad to hear so I know you will be able to take what you need from my explanation and start your learning curve Take a look at the Apple tutorial I referenced above their guides use screenshots and it seems well explained While office management software has evolved much in the past decades they still keep the basic functions Regards You mean the image for the second frame was incomplete when it got shown to you? That could happen fortunately very rarely when the image file transmission from the Zooniverse cloud servers to your browser got stuck or got disrupted for some reason The file itself is OK showing a normal image to me now  This is Scattered Light la Virgo O Only the tops of the arches are bright enough to show up well and here the high Q processing has further stretched them horizontally and further subdued the flanks But the overall arrangement is characteristic  I'm not quite sure what it is either It could be a high Q rendering of an HFB or somewhat less likely an isolated brighter spot in a very faint whistle Calling it NOTA when neither option looks convincing is a safe alternative  There is a proposed glitch class for this whistle variant Gnarly Whistle projects zooniverse gravity spy talk so they can also be classified as None Of The Above while the proposal is pending For once the nickname had been given by the LIGO engineers themselves not by our volunteer community  Wonderful mitchnanny I am so happy that I could be of help and yours is a great starting point Allow me to suggest a learning approach You may resume re learning spreadsheets by creating yourself a simple file with just two or three columns in a tab filled with some words and numbers Then practise adding removing sorting searching renaming painting all the basic actions Then add another tab fill it in and try searching the whole spreadsheet for a number or word Then continue with very small sim searches results downloaded so that you feel in control of the sheet while mastering already the basic functions One step at a time my friend! The subsequent extremely loud noise associated with the lockloss in S has produced extensive data processing artefacts across the whole minute long data segment from which the spectrograms for these three Hanford subjects were produced The blips in S and in the present S are taller than they look they are half hidden behind the dark artefact bands This is best visible when looking at the fourth frames using the "half moon" button to toggle between normal and inverted colours also helps The relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions the lockloss but provides no further details about what caused it  Thank you Coralbell I will definitely have a few practise spreadsheets I will have to sort out some sort of filing system It is a bit fiddly on the iPad You mention adding the bar graph with the sim searches Does that have to be done via Imgur? I hope the answer is no !  Gladfully no haha! There must be an "Insert image" or similar function on your iPad spreadsheet Simply save the histogram image from GS to your device and then use the spreadsheet function to add it on your sheet  I downloaded the dataset from here BUT I doubt there are some instances in the "Extremely Loud" class that are misclassified !

What happened there is that the immense amount of noise just past the right edge upset the preprocessing whitening algorithm acting on the minute long data segment from which the seconds wide spectrograms were extracted The strain channel was already extremely noisy at time seconds but it then got a whole lot noisier over the next few seconds by several orders of magnitude and the algorithms used at the time reacted by producing very small numbers and very dark spectrogram colors for the seconds window we get to see This was pointed out a while later apropos of a similar subject from the second observing run the first use of the zerosignal hashtag in Gravity Spy Talk one of the comments there provides some further explanation projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 466268?comment Training the Machine Learning to recognize such nearly zero signal spectrograms as originating from events that truly are extremely loud it can't get any worse than the interferometer losing the lock! had been useful at the time even though it looks confusing at first glance to our human eyes Hope this sheds some light on the matter!

Thank you dear mitchnanny I am confident you will find yor way and am so glad again to hear that you learnt this much today  Hmmm it was too difficult to scour usual major giant corporate software instruction manuals and imagine what I needed todo to figure out steps to get necessary files and data together Best help possible for me was to create Linux like batch file assuming I wanted to process some data in shell scripts I was just a kid then as can be imagined in the days before release of Windows we picked it up from junk and built various ecosystems to use up last of computer's life and here we are today What now replaced spreadsheet was direct use of Relational DataBase engine a GNU software suite of traditional SQL language with no additional licensing required for older software manual sheets are still paper based no need to download huge PDFs using a paid internet connection and operating procedures have not changed from then to now This is biggest advantage we can continue to have all users process something in exactly the same way I'm envisioned discussing various glitched data using exactly same results in those ways!

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes! It involves a lot of tapping provided you have the correct bit highlighted Thank you Coralbell I have printed out the instructions I couldn find anything about it yesterday At least I know it can be done in Numbers I actually have all my sim searches for my main two collections kept as printouts in folders As I go on I get more organised with them so if necessary I can go back to them I cross reference from my index cards It only in the last few months I have been cascading or I imagine I have looking for raindrop and fly bliplets so have dozens of printouts  True Also the present subject is the only one from the group above that was rendered at  Oops I did forget sigh don't know what I was thinking about Thank you so much for reminding me and also for proposing the "blip subclass blip" Without your reference subjects and description I would have only added to the collection subjects that were taller than Hz  Blip and small fireball  fireball koi   sprites  repeating koi   bliplet at 40hz Glad to hear that you could find it and keeping the instructions handy is always a good idea Both links I sent you along this conversation refer to Numbers User Guide for iPad https support apple com guide numbers ipad welcome ipados There is a Table of Contents covering different help topics which could serve as a useful reference in the future I am sorry that I do not own an iPad to give you specific answers for that device but I am happy to share any knowledge I might have to help you sort things out  You have been amazingly helpful Coralbell All this must have taken you away from your own important work Thank you  Sorry about the confusion ZngabitanT and glad that you referenced my paragraph where I mention Droplet so that the differences are sorted out and now we welcome Mackerel to the Blip family!

rectangular time frequency regions between a lower and a higher frequency and between a start and end time and computes the amount of noise or sometimes real GW signal intensity when a GW comes along that's present within each rectangle Any rectangle where the noise level exceeds a predetermined threshold and which are not contained within a larger rectangle that's also noisy above the threshold get called out by Omicron as "triggers" Well it doesn't actually shout of course it writes out a brief description of what it thought it had found to a file This description includes the event time the middle point of the rectangle's extent in time the moment in time that gets mapped to " seconds" in our subject images and the central frequency in Hz the middle of the rectangle in the frequency direction but on a linear scale just taking the average of lower and upper bounding frequency of the rectangle so we know where the rectangle was It includes the width of the rectangle along the time axis as the duration in seconds and the height of the rectangle along the frequency axis as the bandwidth again expressed in Hz Thus central frequency minus half the bandwidth recovers the lower bounding frequency of the rectangle and central frequency plus half the bandwidth gives the upper bounding frequency So we also know how large the rectangle was Blips will often get reported in tall rectangles of short duration "line" glitches in long duration rectangles spanning only a small bandwidth of frequencies But Omicron quite often reports an even larger rectangle for reasons that aren't always obvious Sometimes it's because of additional noise between and kHz that we don't get to see So the reported duration and bandwidth values need to be taken with a grain of salt The preceding do not yet imply anything about the shape and intensity of the glitch contained in the rectangle Imagine a three dimensional model time by frequency by noise intensity where the noise intensity sticks out of the screen Our colour scheme from dark violet to bright yellow is then a measure of how far it sticks out as in a map of a mountain landscape where colours represent altitude The peak frequency is approximately the frequency where the highest peak of this mountain is located where the mountain of noise sticks the most out of the screen But it's not exact it's more like merely naming just the grid square on an Ordnance Survey map inside which the true peak is located That's the "binning" we've been discussing And the snr signal to background noise ratio is a measure of how tall the peak is how far it sticks out of the screen It's useful for finding duplicates because it's computed from the raw data which are never exactly equal for two different glitches in a way that doesn't involve any discrete binning "Tallest peak" means tallest within the particular trigger rectangle that Omicron was reporting not tallest within the whole seconds wide and 2Khz tall region that later gets rendered as a Gravity Spy spectrogram image There may be more than one trigger rectangle within the same spectrogram region and the other glitches may have peaks that are even taller than the glitch around time seconds that was responsible for the trigger Such as the very loud glitch on the left side "stage right" in the Gravity Spy logo image And occasionally we end up with a rather dark area around seconds flanked by bright yellow on both sides Omicron sometimes regards groups of glitchlets as one single glitch that gets reported as one single noisy rectangle and then it's possible for the central time to fall in the middle between two or more glitchlets noise peaks Finally the similarity score does not come from Omicron and is not a property of the single glitch subject it's a measure how closely a subject resembles the given one that was used to start the search means they're the same glitch would be as dissimilar as possible In the DYCWMI tool this column remains empty since it would be meaningless In order for a broadband connection to deliver a high bandwidth in the bytes second sense it needs to use a sufficiently broad range of frequencies for the underlying physical signals on the wire so in that sense it's analogous Hope this helps!

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. Often, citizen scientists hypothesize the origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

ZngabitanT describes this new class and its characteristics, highlighting that these blips are different from other subclasses such as Blip, Trumpetfish, and Sardine.\n\n2. **Emerging Questions:**\n   - There is a question raised about the frequency range of a potential "Scattered Light" glitch at 18Hz, contemplating if it is too high for that class.\n   - Another question arises about the presence of a glitch resembling "Rain" and the repetition of blips in the spectrograms. The analysis seems to be focused on identifying unique patterns and occurrences within the glitches.\n\n3. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins:**\n   - One hypothesis in Talk data set 2 suggests that a particular glitch might be related to raindrops based on its appearance in the spectogram. The analytical motivation behind this hypothesis likely stems from the visual similarity of the glitch to what one might expect from raindrop interference.\n   - Additionally, there is speculation regarding the origins of specific glitches being potentially linked to various fish species like trumpetfish and sardines.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:
     I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well  Ohhhh sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet  Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness Note the double tip at the top of the central shape  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time seconds provided it's recognizable Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs I'll just classify them as such for consistency Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards Now I need a new plan Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O so there is no hurry for this information just yet Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic !

Also I was able to download the excel file I normally just view then print to work on the search results and save it to Numbers It a start I have a long way to go but I am extremely grateful for what I have just learned from you It all a huge learning curve for me Thank you  Good morning mitchnanny glad to hear so I know you will be able to take what you need from my explanation and start your learning curve Take a look at the Apple tutorial I referenced above their guides use screenshots and it seems well explained While office management software has evolved much in the past decades they still keep the basic functions Regards You mean the image for the second frame was incomplete when it got shown to you? That could happen fortunately very rarely when the image file transmission from the Zooniverse cloud servers to your browser got stuck or got disrupted for some reason The file itself is OK showing a normal image to me now  This is Scattered Light la Virgo O Only the tops of the arches are bright enough to show up well and here the high Q processing has further stretched them horizontally and further subdued the flanks But the overall arrangement is characteristic  I'm not quite sure what it is either It could be a high Q rendering of an HFB or somewhat less likely an isolated brighter spot in a very faint whistle Calling it NOTA when neither option looks convincing is a safe alternative  There is a proposed glitch class for this whistle variant Gnarly Whistle projects zooniverse gravity spy talk so they can also be classified as None Of The Above while the proposal is pending For once the nickname had been given by the LIGO engineers themselves not by our volunteer community  Wonderful mitchnanny I am so happy that I could be of help and yours is a great starting point Allow me to suggest a learning approach You may resume re learning spreadsheets by creating yourself a simple file with just two or three columns in a tab filled with some words and numbers Then practise adding removing sorting searching renaming painting all the basic actions Then add another tab fill it in and try searching the whole spreadsheet for a number or word Then continue with very small sim searches results downloaded so that you feel in control of the sheet while mastering already the basic functions One step at a time my friend! The subsequent extremely loud noise associated with the lockloss in S has produced extensive data processing artefacts across the whole minute long data segment from which the spectrograms for these three Hanford subjects were produced The blips in S and in the present S are taller than they look they are half hidden behind the dark artefact bands This is best visible when looking at the fourth frames using the "half moon" button to toggle between normal and inverted colours also helps The relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions the lockloss but provides no further details about what caused it  Thank you Coralbell I will definitely have a few practise spreadsheets I will have to sort out some sort of filing system It is a bit fiddly on the iPad You mention adding the bar graph with the sim searches Does that have to be done via Imgur? I hope the answer is no !  Gladfully no haha! There must be an "Insert image" or similar function on your iPad spreadsheet Simply save the histogram image from GS to your device and then use the spreadsheet function to add it on your sheet  I downloaded the dataset from here BUT I doubt there are some instances in the "Extremely Loud" class that are misclassified !

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes!

rectangular time frequency regions between a lower and a higher frequency and between a start and end time and computes the amount of noise or sometimes real GW signal intensity when a GW comes along that's present within each rectangle Any rectangle where the noise level exceeds a predetermined threshold and which are not contained within a larger rectangle that's also noisy above the threshold get called out by Omicron as "triggers" Well it doesn't actually shout of course it writes out a brief description of what it thought it had found to a file This description includes the event time the middle point of the rectangle's extent in time the moment in time that gets mapped to " seconds" in our subject images and the central frequency in Hz the middle of the rectangle in the frequency direction but on a linear scale just taking the average of lower and upper bounding frequency of the rectangle so we know where the rectangle was It includes the width of the rectangle along the time axis as the duration in seconds and the height of the rectangle along the frequency axis as the bandwidth again expressed in Hz Thus central frequency minus half the bandwidth recovers the lower bounding frequency of the rectangle and central frequency plus half the bandwidth gives the upper bounding frequency So we also know how large the rectangle was Blips will often get reported in tall rectangles of short duration "line" glitches in long duration rectangles spanning only a small bandwidth of frequencies But Omicron quite often reports an even larger rectangle for reasons that aren't always obvious Sometimes it's because of additional noise between and kHz that we don't get to see So the reported duration and bandwidth values need to be taken with a grain of salt The preceding do not yet imply anything about the shape and intensity of the glitch contained in the rectangle Imagine a three dimensional model time by frequency by noise intensity where the noise intensity sticks out of the screen Our colour scheme from dark violet to bright yellow is then a measure of how far it sticks out as in a map of a mountain landscape where colours represent altitude The peak frequency is approximately the frequency where the highest peak of this mountain is located where the mountain of noise sticks the most out of the screen But it's not exact it's more like merely naming just the grid square on an Ordnance Survey map inside which the true peak is located That's the "binning" we've been discussing And the snr signal to background noise ratio is a measure of how tall the peak is how far it sticks out of the screen It's useful for finding duplicates because it's computed from the raw data which are never exactly equal for two different glitches in a way that doesn't involve any discrete binning "Tallest peak" means tallest within the particular trigger rectangle that Omicron was reporting not tallest within the whole seconds wide and 2Khz tall region that later gets rendered as a Gravity Spy spectrogram image There may be more than one trigger rectangle within the same spectrogram region and the other glitches may have peaks that are even taller than the glitch around time seconds that was responsible for the trigger Such as the very loud glitch on the left side "stage right" in the Gravity Spy logo image And occasionally we end up with a rather dark area around seconds flanked by bright yellow on both sides Omicron sometimes regards groups of glitchlets as one single glitch that gets reported as one single noisy rectangle and then it's possible for the central time to fall in the middle between two or more glitchlets noise peaks Finally the similarity score does not come from Omicron and is not a property of the single glitch subject it's a measure how closely a subject resembles the given one that was used to start the search means they're the same glitch would be as dissimilar as possible In the DYCWMI tool this column remains empty since it would be meaningless In order for a broadband connection to deliver a high bandwidth in the bytes second sense it needs to use a sufficiently broad range of frequencies for the underlying physical signals on the wire so in that sense it's analogous Hope this helps!

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. Often, citizen scientists hypothesize the origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. The citizen scientists know that these glitches occur because of enviornmental factors such as weather or because of information noise or errors of sensor measurments. If Talk data set 2 has hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9FX6zSzeltOsp54VCnPA7G6jyQ7Ls', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='In Talk data set 2, there are several novel developments compared to Talk data set 1:\n\n1. **New Glitch Class Proposal:**\n    - A new glitch class is proposed in Talk data set 2 called "Blip subclass blip" by ZngabitanT. This subclass focuses on blips that are taller than two octaves in frequency and have distinctive characteristics. The proposal includes details about the peak frequencies, bandwidth, and distinguishing features of this subclass.\n\n2. **Emerging Questions:**\n    - In Talk data set 2, there are emerging questions related to the classifications and technical aspects of glitches. One question pertains to the central frequency in relation to peak frequency and the measurement of bandwidth. This question shows a desire for deeper understanding of how these parameters are determined and their significance in characterizing glitches.\n    \n3. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins:**\n    - In Talk data set 2, there are hypotheses proposed by citizen scientists regarding the origins of glitches. One hypothesis suggests that glitches may be influenced by environmental factors such as weather conditions. Another hypothesis indicates that glitches could arise from information noise or errors in sensor measurements. These hypotheses are driven by the need to understand the external factors that contribute to glitch occurrences and to improve the interpretation of spectrogram data.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713489229, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_d9767fc5b9', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=263, prompt_tokens=13847, total_tokens=14110))

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:
     I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well  Ohhhh sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet  Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness Note the double tip at the top of the central shape  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time seconds provided it's recognizable Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify Thank you for contributing! I've been saying NOTA because they don't look quite like LFBs I'll just classify them as such for consistency Thanks a lot!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards Now I need a new plan Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O so there is no hurry for this information just yet Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nicm I like being able to see the two "near time subjects" I guess this one can be classified as fireball koi instead of repeating koi  Correction there doesn't seem to be a koi so only fireballs     bliplet at 40hz plus four other smaller features   fireball koi  Clair de lune?  bliplet at 40hz  fireball koi   19hz braid  crown at Q5? 19hz  candle  Hz not long enough to qualify as Hz line   bliplet at 40hz  483hz line  ZngabitanT Would this one qualify as borderline varnish run blip or should it be a borderline varnish run koi? Crowns at Q22?  coronet  repeating koi   20hz  bliplet at 40hz  koi fireball at Q11

Also I was able to download the excel file I normally just view then print to work on the search results and save it to Numbers It a start I have a long way to go but I am extremely grateful for what I have just learned from you It all a huge learning curve for me Thank you  Good morning mitchnanny glad to hear so I know you will be able to take what you need from my explanation and start your learning curve Take a look at the Apple tutorial I referenced above their guides use screenshots and it seems well explained While office management software has evolved much in the past decades they still keep the basic functions Regards You mean the image for the second frame was incomplete when it got shown to you? That could happen fortunately very rarely when the image file transmission from the Zooniverse cloud servers to your browser got stuck or got disrupted for some reason The file itself is OK showing a normal image to me now  This is Scattered Light la Virgo O Only the tops of the arches are bright enough to show up well and here the high Q processing has further stretched them horizontally and further subdued the flanks But the overall arrangement is characteristic  I'm not quite sure what it is either It could be a high Q rendering of an HFB or somewhat less likely an isolated brighter spot in a very faint whistle Calling it NOTA when neither option looks convincing is a safe alternative  There is a proposed glitch class for this whistle variant Gnarly Whistle projects zooniverse gravity spy talk so they can also be classified as None Of The Above while the proposal is pending For once the nickname had been given by the LIGO engineers themselves not by our volunteer community  Wonderful mitchnanny I am so happy that I could be of help and yours is a great starting point Allow me to suggest a learning approach You may resume re learning spreadsheets by creating yourself a simple file with just two or three columns in a tab filled with some words and numbers Then practise adding removing sorting searching renaming painting all the basic actions Then add another tab fill it in and try searching the whole spreadsheet for a number or word Then continue with very small sim searches results downloaded so that you feel in control of the sheet while mastering already the basic functions One step at a time my friend! The subsequent extremely loud noise associated with the lockloss in S has produced extensive data processing artefacts across the whole minute long data segment from which the spectrograms for these three Hanford subjects were produced The blips in S and in the present S are taller than they look they are half hidden behind the dark artefact bands This is best visible when looking at the fourth frames using the "half moon" button to toggle between normal and inverted colours also helps The relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions the lockloss but provides no further details about what caused it  Thank you Coralbell I will definitely have a few practise spreadsheets I will have to sort out some sort of filing system It is a bit fiddly on the iPad You mention adding the bar graph with the sim searches Does that have to be done via Imgur? I hope the answer is no !  Gladfully no haha! There must be an "Insert image" or similar function on your iPad spreadsheet Simply save the histogram image from GS to your device and then use the spreadsheet function to add it on your sheet  I downloaded the dataset from here BUT I doubt there are some instances in the "Extremely Loud" class that are misclassified !

One more attempt at this wretched bliplets sim search then that it! Definitely a G T evening coming up! Hi Nicm in the VERY dim and distant past when I was working with medical records it was a Linux system so I have at least heard of it!

What happened there is that the immense amount of noise just past the right edge upset the preprocessing whitening algorithm acting on the minute long data segment from which the seconds wide spectrograms were extracted The strain channel was already extremely noisy at time seconds but it then got a whole lot noisier over the next few seconds by several orders of magnitude and the algorithms used at the time reacted by producing very small numbers and very dark spectrogram colors for the seconds window we get to see This was pointed out a while later apropos of a similar subject from the second observing run the first use of the zerosignal hashtag in Gravity Spy Talk one of the comments there provides some further explanation projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 466268?comment Training the Machine Learning to recognize such nearly zero signal spectrograms as originating from events that truly are extremely loud it can't get any worse than the interferometer losing the lock! had been useful at the time even though it looks confusing at first glance to our human eyes Hope this sheds some light on the matter!

Third subject for my "Don't Know" collection  Hi mitchnanny you may delete or hide columns you do not feel you need in your spreadsheets While I like to keep all the columns of the downloaded file from sim search the values we use more are links subject subject number SNR peak frequency and Duration I like to keep the ifo column despite having dedicated spreadsheets per interferometer In this way I can quickly catch at a glance if by any chance I performed a sim search slipping the mouse pointer a bit up or down selecting multiple interferometers instead of a single one In this way I won't be mixing interferometers in my collections say a Han collection with Liv intruders It is up to you about what columns to keep Also if you wish to add custom columns while having the other data columns visible without the need to scroll left or right you may consider either deleting or hiding Hide Column those less relevant   needle eye   fireball koi  I wondered about the similarity score I haven tried hiding columns yet but I am nowhere near doing this at the moment Time to stop now Thank you again for your help Coralbell I really appreciate it   ripple uniqueid does not exist Looks like a normal blip and a lower frequency blip  bliplet at 40hz  borderline varnish run blip  stitches??

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes!

rectangular time frequency regions between a lower and a higher frequency and between a start and end time and computes the amount of noise or sometimes real GW signal intensity when a GW comes along that's present within each rectangle Any rectangle where the noise level exceeds a predetermined threshold and which are not contained within a larger rectangle that's also noisy above the threshold get called out by Omicron as "triggers" Well it doesn't actually shout of course it writes out a brief description of what it thought it had found to a file This description includes the event time the middle point of the rectangle's extent in time the moment in time that gets mapped to " seconds" in our subject images and the central frequency in Hz the middle of the rectangle in the frequency direction but on a linear scale just taking the average of lower and upper bounding frequency of the rectangle so we know where the rectangle was It includes the width of the rectangle along the time axis as the duration in seconds and the height of the rectangle along the frequency axis as the bandwidth again expressed in Hz Thus central frequency minus half the bandwidth recovers the lower bounding frequency of the rectangle and central frequency plus half the bandwidth gives the upper bounding frequency So we also know how large the rectangle was Blips will often get reported in tall rectangles of short duration "line" glitches in long duration rectangles spanning only a small bandwidth of frequencies But Omicron quite often reports an even larger rectangle for reasons that aren't always obvious Sometimes it's because of additional noise between and kHz that we don't get to see So the reported duration and bandwidth values need to be taken with a grain of salt The preceding do not yet imply anything about the shape and intensity of the glitch contained in the rectangle Imagine a three dimensional model time by frequency by noise intensity where the noise intensity sticks out of the screen Our colour scheme from dark violet to bright yellow is then a measure of how far it sticks out as in a map of a mountain landscape where colours represent altitude The peak frequency is approximately the frequency where the highest peak of this mountain is located where the mountain of noise sticks the most out of the screen But it's not exact it's more like merely naming just the grid square on an Ordnance Survey map inside which the true peak is located That's the "binning" we've been discussing And the snr signal to background noise ratio is a measure of how tall the peak is how far it sticks out of the screen It's useful for finding duplicates because it's computed from the raw data which are never exactly equal for two different glitches in a way that doesn't involve any discrete binning "Tallest peak" means tallest within the particular trigger rectangle that Omicron was reporting not tallest within the whole seconds wide and 2Khz tall region that later gets rendered as a Gravity Spy spectrogram image There may be more than one trigger rectangle within the same spectrogram region and the other glitches may have peaks that are even taller than the glitch around time seconds that was responsible for the trigger Such as the very loud glitch on the left side "stage right" in the Gravity Spy logo image And occasionally we end up with a rather dark area around seconds flanked by bright yellow on both sides Omicron sometimes regards groups of glitchlets as one single glitch that gets reported as one single noisy rectangle and then it's possible for the central time to fall in the middle between two or more glitchlets noise peaks Finally the similarity score does not come from Omicron and is not a property of the single glitch subject it's a measure how closely a subject resembles the given one that was used to start the search means they're the same glitch would be as dissimilar as possible In the DYCWMI tool this column remains empty since it would be meaningless In order for a broadband connection to deliver a high bandwidth in the bytes second sense it needs to use a sufficiently broad range of frequencies for the underlying physical signals on the wire so in that sense it's analogous Hope this helps!

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornmental factors or noise in measurements of sensors. Citizen scientists sometimes hypothesize more specific origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:
     I Identified it as 'Koi' but there is what looks like two 'Blips' as well  Ohhhh sorry I just made a mistake clicking the wrong button Pffff I've been classifying them as Low Frequency Bursts They have been much more common at Hanford than at Livingston during O and more common at Hanford during the earlier months of O than during the later ones I don't know why and I've never bothered collecting them myself and am not sure whether anyone else had done so so I can't say anything more precise about their timeline distribution yet  Three is a party! Actually methinks each of the three is itself a blend of at least two short duration glitches with partial cancellation between the members of each pair accounting for the notches and wiggliness Note the double tip at the top of the central shape  Yes sometimes our Koi Fish arrive with company whole shoals of Koi Fish glitches or mixed groups of Koi Fish and Blips We don't have a dedicated glitch class for these combinations so we would focus on the central shape at time seconds provided it's recognizable Thus Koi Fish is the appropriate classification here  Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! Don't worry that happens to every one of us from time to time No harm done each subject is seen by multiple volunteers and you'll be shown other similar subjects to classify Thank you for contributing!

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards Now I need a new plan Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O so there is no hurry for this information just yet Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nicm I like being able to see the two "near time subjects" I guess this one can be classified as fireball koi instead of repeating koi  Correction there doesn't seem to be a koi so only fireballs     bliplet at 40hz plus four other smaller features   fireball koi  Clair de lune?  bliplet at 40hz  fireball koi   19hz braid  crown at Q5? 19hz  candle  Hz not long enough to qualify as Hz line   bliplet at 40hz  483hz line  ZngabitanT Would this one qualify as borderline varnish run blip or should it be a borderline varnish run koi?

Also I was able to download the excel file I normally just view then print to work on the search results and save it to Numbers It a start I have a long way to go but I am extremely grateful for what I have just learned from you It all a huge learning curve for me Thank you  Good morning mitchnanny glad to hear so I know you will be able to take what you need from my explanation and start your learning curve Take a look at the Apple tutorial I referenced above their guides use screenshots and it seems well explained While office management software has evolved much in the past decades they still keep the basic functions Regards You mean the image for the second frame was incomplete when it got shown to you? That could happen fortunately very rarely when the image file transmission from the Zooniverse cloud servers to your browser got stuck or got disrupted for some reason The file itself is OK showing a normal image to me now  This is Scattered Light la Virgo O Only the tops of the arches are bright enough to show up well and here the high Q processing has further stretched them horizontally and further subdued the flanks But the overall arrangement is characteristic  I'm not quite sure what it is either It could be a high Q rendering of an HFB or somewhat less likely an isolated brighter spot in a very faint whistle Calling it NOTA when neither option looks convincing is a safe alternative  There is a proposed glitch class for this whistle variant Gnarly Whistle projects zooniverse gravity spy talk so they can also be classified as None Of The Above while the proposal is pending For once the nickname had been given by the LIGO engineers themselves not by our volunteer community  Wonderful mitchnanny I am so happy that I could be of help and yours is a great starting point Allow me to suggest a learning approach You may resume re learning spreadsheets by creating yourself a simple file with just two or three columns in a tab filled with some words and numbers Then practise adding removing sorting searching renaming painting all the basic actions Then add another tab fill it in and try searching the whole spreadsheet for a number or word Then continue with very small sim searches results downloaded so that you feel in control of the sheet while mastering already the basic functions One step at a time my friend! The subsequent extremely loud noise associated with the lockloss in S has produced extensive data processing artefacts across the whole minute long data segment from which the spectrograms for these three Hanford subjects were produced The blips in S and in the present S are taller than they look they are half hidden behind the dark artefact bands This is best visible when looking at the fourth frames using the "half moon" button to toggle between normal and inverted colours also helps The relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions the lockloss but provides no further details about what caused it  Thank you Coralbell I will definitely have a few practise spreadsheets I will have to sort out some sort of filing system It is a bit fiddly on the iPad You mention adding the bar graph with the sim searches Does that have to be done via Imgur? I hope the answer is no !  Gladfully no haha! There must be an "Insert image" or similar function on your iPad spreadsheet Simply save the histogram image from GS to your device and then use the spreadsheet function to add it on your sheet  I downloaded the dataset from here BUT I doubt there are some instances in the "Extremely Loud" class that are misclassified ! Example https imgloc com lKYT Is that true? How can we correct those instances? ! Example Alt Text https xyz lKYT png  Thank goodness for that!

I have managed to save a sim search to Numbers plus bar chart but forgot to create a collection I thought I could go back with the back arrow but the collection had different subject numbers I have huge problems creating folders in the right place and I don want hundreds of individual sim searches floating around Just as I think I have created a folder and saved something into it I can find it again Stuff can be saved to the iPad or the cloud but ultimately it all gets backed up to the cloud I have had desktop computers in the past but prefer the iPad for most of my uses I intend to replace it some time and may get an external keyboard If all else fails it back to the cards!!! One more attempt at this wretched bliplets sim search then that it! Definitely a G T evening coming up! Hi Nicm in the VERY dim and distant past when I was working with medical records it was a Linux system so I have at least heard of it! I didn do anything with the system itself can you imagine the chaos!

What happened there is that the immense amount of noise just past the right edge upset the preprocessing whitening algorithm acting on the minute long data segment from which the seconds wide spectrograms were extracted The strain channel was already extremely noisy at time seconds but it then got a whole lot noisier over the next few seconds by several orders of magnitude and the algorithms used at the time reacted by producing very small numbers and very dark spectrogram colors for the seconds window we get to see This was pointed out a while later apropos of a similar subject from the second observing run the first use of the zerosignal hashtag in Gravity Spy Talk one of the comments there provides some further explanation projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 466268?comment Training the Machine Learning to recognize such nearly zero signal spectrograms as originating from events that truly are extremely loud it can't get any worse than the interferometer losing the lock! had been useful at the time even though it looks confusing at first glance to our human eyes Hope this sheds some light on the matter!

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes!

rectangular time frequency regions between a lower and a higher frequency and between a start and end time and computes the amount of noise or sometimes real GW signal intensity when a GW comes along that's present within each rectangle Any rectangle where the noise level exceeds a predetermined threshold and which are not contained within a larger rectangle that's also noisy above the threshold get called out by Omicron as "triggers" Well it doesn't actually shout of course it writes out a brief description of what it thought it had found to a file This description includes the event time the middle point of the rectangle's extent in time the moment in time that gets mapped to " seconds" in our subject images and the central frequency in Hz the middle of the rectangle in the frequency direction but on a linear scale just taking the average of lower and upper bounding frequency of the rectangle so we know where the rectangle was It includes the width of the rectangle along the time axis as the duration in seconds and the height of the rectangle along the frequency axis as the bandwidth again expressed in Hz Thus central frequency minus half the bandwidth recovers the lower bounding frequency of the rectangle and central frequency plus half the bandwidth gives the upper bounding frequency So we also know how large the rectangle was Blips will often get reported in tall rectangles of short duration "line" glitches in long duration rectangles spanning only a small bandwidth of frequencies But Omicron quite often reports an even larger rectangle for reasons that aren't always obvious Sometimes it's because of additional noise between and kHz that we don't get to see So the reported duration and bandwidth values need to be taken with a grain of salt The preceding do not yet imply anything about the shape and intensity of the glitch contained in the rectangle Imagine a three dimensional model time by frequency by noise intensity where the noise intensity sticks out of the screen Our colour scheme from dark violet to bright yellow is then a measure of how far it sticks out as in a map of a mountain landscape where colours represent altitude The peak frequency is approximately the frequency where the highest peak of this mountain is located where the mountain of noise sticks the most out of the screen But it's not exact it's more like merely naming just the grid square on an Ordnance Survey map inside which the true peak is located That's the "binning" we've been discussing And the snr signal to background noise ratio is a measure of how tall the peak is how far it sticks out of the screen It's useful for finding duplicates because it's computed from the raw data which are never exactly equal for two different glitches in a way that doesn't involve any discrete binning "Tallest peak" means tallest within the particular trigger rectangle that Omicron was reporting not tallest within the whole seconds wide and 2Khz tall region that later gets rendered as a Gravity Spy spectrogram image There may be more than one trigger rectangle within the same spectrogram region and the other glitches may have peaks that are even taller than the glitch around time seconds that was responsible for the trigger Such as the very loud glitch on the left side "stage right" in the Gravity Spy logo image And occasionally we end up with a rather dark area around seconds flanked by bright yellow on both sides Omicron sometimes regards groups of glitchlets as one single glitch that gets reported as one single noisy rectangle and then it's possible for the central time to fall in the middle between two or more glitchlets noise peaks Finally the similarity score does not come from Omicron and is not a property of the single glitch subject it's a measure how closely a subject resembles the given one that was used to start the search means they're the same glitch would be as dissimilar as possible In the DYCWMI tool this column remains empty since it would be meaningless In order for a broadband connection to deliver a high bandwidth in the bytes second sense it needs to use a sufficiently broad range of frequencies for the underlying physical signals on the wire so in that sense it's analogous Hope this helps!

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. The origins of glitches are usually related to factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists sometimes hypothesize more specific origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

This subclass describes broadband glitches of short duration with teardrop shapes and a specific range of peak frequencies. The subclass is still under investigation, and its peak frequencies range from about Hz to Hz. This proposal expands the taxonomy of glitch classifications within the LIGO sensor data.\n\n2. **Emerging Questions:** In Talk data set 2, citizen scientists have posed new questions related to glitch classes, sensors, and gravitational wave science. One such question is about the similarity score in Omicron software and its significance in identifying duplicates. The reasoning behind this question is to understand the criteria used to determine the similarity between glitches and how it impacts the identification of duplicate instances in the data.\n\n3. **Specific Hypotheses on Glitch Origins:** In Talk data set 2, citizen scientists have put forth more specific hypotheses regarding the origins of glitches. One hypothesis suggests that certain glitches could be related to "anchovy" fish, which are less tall blips with peak frequencies around or Hz. This hypothesis is motivated by a desire to further characterize and classify glitches that fall within this specific frequency range, providing a more detailed understanding of the types of glitches observed in the data.\n\nOverall, Talk data set 2 showcases an evolving exploration of glitch classifications, deeper inquiries into glitch characteristics, and more detailed hypotheses regarding the origins of glitches observed in the LIGO sensor data.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713489455, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_d9767fc5b9', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=330, prompt_tokens=13839, total_tokens=14169))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

That could happen fortunately very rarely when the image file transmission from the Zooniverse cloud servers to your browser got stuck or got disrupted for some reason The file itself is OK showing a normal image to me now  This is Scattered Light la Virgo O Only the tops of the arches are bright enough to show up well and here the high Q processing has further stretched them horizontally and further subdued the flanks But the overall arrangement is characteristic  I'm not quite sure what it is either It could be a high Q rendering of an HFB or somewhat less likely an isolated brighter spot in a very faint whistle Calling it NOTA when neither option looks convincing is a safe alternative  There is a proposed glitch class for this whistle variant Gnarly Whistle projects zooniverse gravity spy talk so they can also be classified as None Of The Above while the proposal is pending For once the nickname had been given by the LIGO engineers themselves not by our volunteer community  Wonderful mitchnanny I am so happy that I could be of help and yours is a great starting point Allow me to suggest a learning approach You may resume re learning spreadsheets by creating yourself a simple file with just two or three columns in a tab filled with some words and numbers Then practise adding removing sorting searching renaming painting all the basic actions Then add another tab fill it in and try searching the whole spreadsheet for a number or word Then continue with very small sim searches results downloaded so that you feel in control of the sheet while mastering already the basic functions One step at a time my friend! The subsequent extremely loud noise associated with the lockloss in S has produced extensive data processing artefacts across the whole minute long data segment from which the spectrograms for these three Hanford subjects were produced The blips in S and in the present S are taller than they look they are half hidden behind the dark artefact bands This is best visible when looking at the fourth frames using the "half moon" button to toggle between normal and inverted colours also helps The relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions the lockloss but provides no further details about what caused it  Thank you Coralbell I will definitely have a few practise spreadsheets I will have to sort out some sort of filing system It is a bit fiddly on the iPad You mention adding the bar graph with the sim searches Does that have to be done via Imgur? I hope the answer is no !  Gladfully no haha! There must be an "Insert image" or similar function on your iPad spreadsheet Simply save the histogram image from GS to your device and then use the spreadsheet function to add it on your sheet  I downloaded the dataset from here BUT I doubt there are some instances in the "Extremely Loud" class that are misclassified ! Example https imgloc com lKYT Is that true? How can we correct those instances? ! Example Alt Text https xyz lKYT png  Thank goodness for that!

What happened there is that the immense amount of noise just past the right edge upset the preprocessing whitening algorithm acting on the minute long data segment from which the seconds wide spectrograms were extracted The strain channel was already extremely noisy at time seconds but it then got a whole lot noisier over the next few seconds by several orders of magnitude and the algorithms used at the time reacted by producing very small numbers and very dark spectrogram colors for the seconds window we get to see This was pointed out a while later apropos of a similar subject from the second observing run the first use of the zerosignal hashtag in Gravity Spy Talk one of the comments there provides some further explanation projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 466268?comment Training the Machine Learning to recognize such nearly zero signal spectrograms as originating from events that truly are extremely loud it can't get any worse than the interferometer losing the lock! had been useful at the time even though it looks confusing at first glance to our human eyes Hope this sheds some light on the matter!

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes!

I like the analogy with OS maps and 3D images From my point of view can central frequency and bandwidth along with similarity scores can be disregarded? Sorry I am still confused about peak frequency Is it as I originally thought the frequency of the peak or the frequency of peaks in one second? I have only just realised that individual columns can be sorted I presume only ascending I knew DYCWMI could be sorted I read this in Notes some time ago but stupidly hadn thought to apply it to the normal sim searches It was only in reply to another query that this was mentioned Are there any other tips relating to sim searches? It would be great if the photos of the glitches in the search results were horizontal as in the example rather than vertical Thank you!  Thank you very much for your patient help! The Q transform method based on GWPY seems to have limitations by the way do you know other ways to classify the glitches besides Q transform? When classifying is it usually based on the one dimensional timeseries data or based on the plots based on Q transform? In order Yes that's an example of Omicron having detected additional noise at high frequencies above the Hz top edge of our images in the case of but not in where the central frequency and bandwidth roughly agree with the height of the bliplet but the rectangle is wider than obviously necessary in the latter case the reported duration is seconds enclosing some faint stuff off to the side of the bliplet Probably yes The noisiest frequency the frequency bin where the distribution of noise vs frequency peaks Not the repetition rate of peaks To change from ascending to descending order click a second time on the same column heading The thumbnail pictures were arranged horizontally some years ago until people complained that this took up to much horizontal space and they had to scroll so far sideways to see the numbers Then the arrangement was changed to vertical and we have to scroll a longer way down the page of results Just can't please everyone! On a mobile device like an iPad or using the touchpad on a laptop scrolling horizontally or vertically is equally easy but vertical motions are easier than horizontal ones for people using a mouse with a little scroll wheel so they are better served by the present arrangement  Brilliant! Thank you very much ZngabitanT I must go and try out the sorting ascending and descending!  At the moment while the detection of real gravitational wave signals always relies on the raw timeseries data it has to the Q transform doesn't preserve enough information the classification of individual glitches still relies to a large extent on the Q transform images or even when the observatory operators need a quick overview just on the timestamp peak frequency and SNR without further classification in the form of cluster plots of the bulk distribution E from https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep !

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. The origins of glitches are usually related to factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists sometimes hypothesize more specific origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

The mackerel glitch class is described as being under investigation in terms of its peak frequency band. This indicates a continuous evolution in the classification and subclassification of glitches by the citizen scientists.\n\n2. **Emerging Questions:** Citizen scientists in Talk data set 2 seem to be delving deeper into the technical aspects of glitches and their classifications. Some emerging questions include:\n   - Understanding the reasons for similar appearances of glitches with different central frequencies and bandwidths, despite being classified differently.\n   - Querying about the significance of peak frequency and bandwidth in glitch classification and whether they can be disregarded.\n   - Seeking tips and advice on optimizing sim searches and navigating through glitch data more efficiently.\n   - Inquiring about ways to search for individual subjects within a collection without having to browse through multiple pages, especially when looking for duplicates.\n\n3. **Specific Hypotheses on Glitch Origins:** Talk data set 2 exhibits citizen scientists proposing more specific hypotheses about the origins of glitches, reflecting a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Yes instead save the csv and edit it with vi editor Almost years old system and now IBM may helps  Aaaaaargh! I have managed to save a sim search to Numbers plus bar chart but forgot to create a collection I thought I could go back with the back arrow but the collection had different subject numbers I have huge problems creating folders in the right place and I don want hundreds of individual sim searches floating around Just as I think I have created a folder and saved something into it I can find it again Stuff can be saved to the iPad or the cloud but ultimately it all gets backed up to the cloud I have had desktop computers in the past but prefer the iPad for most of my uses I intend to replace it some time and may get an external keyboard If all else fails it back to the cards!!! One more attempt at this wretched bliplets sim search then that it! Definitely a G T evening coming up! Hi Nicm in the VERY dim and distant past when I was working with medical records it was a Linux system so I have at least heard of it!

What happened there is that the immense amount of noise just past the right edge upset the preprocessing whitening algorithm acting on the minute long data segment from which the seconds wide spectrograms were extracted The strain channel was already extremely noisy at time seconds but it then got a whole lot noisier over the next few seconds by several orders of magnitude and the algorithms used at the time reacted by producing very small numbers and very dark spectrogram colors for the seconds window we get to see This was pointed out a while later apropos of a similar subject from the second observing run the first use of the zerosignal hashtag in Gravity Spy Talk one of the comments there provides some further explanation projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 466268?comment Training the Machine Learning to recognize such nearly zero signal spectrograms as originating from events that truly are extremely loud it can't get any worse than the interferometer losing the lock! had been useful at the time even though it looks confusing at first glance to our human eyes Hope this sheds some light on the matter!

Thank you dear mitchnanny I am confident you will find yor way and am so glad again to hear that you learnt this much today  Hmmm it was too difficult to scour usual major giant corporate software instruction manuals and imagine what I needed todo to figure out steps to get necessary files and data together Best help possible for me was to create Linux like batch file assuming I wanted to process some data in shell scripts I was just a kid then as can be imagined in the days before release of Windows we picked it up from junk and built various ecosystems to use up last of computer's life and here we are today What now replaced spreadsheet was direct use of Relational DataBase engine a GNU software suite of traditional SQL language with no additional licensing required for older software manual sheets are still paper based no need to download huge PDFs using a paid internet connection and operating procedures have not changed from then to now This is biggest advantage we can continue to have all users process something in exactly the same way I'm envisioned discussing various glitched data using exactly same results in those ways!

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes! It involves a lot of tapping provided you have the correct bit highlighted Thank you Coralbell I have printed out the instructions I couldn find anything about it yesterday At least I know it can be done in Numbers I actually have all my sim searches for my main two collections kept as printouts in folders As I go on I get more organised with them so if necessary I can go back to them I cross reference from my index cards It only in the last few months I have been cascading or I imagine I have looking for raindrop and fly bliplets so have dozens of printouts  True Also the present subject is the only one from the group above that was rendered at  Oops I did forget sigh don't know what I was thinking about Thank you so much for reminding me and also for proposing the "blip subclass blip" Without your reference subjects and description I would have only added to the collection subjects that were taller than Hz  Blip and small fireball  fireball koi   sprites  repeating koi   bliplet at 40hz Glad to hear that you could find it and keeping the instructions handy is always a good idea Both links I sent you along this conversation refer to Numbers User Guide for iPad https support apple com guide numbers ipad welcome ipados There is a Table of Contents covering different help topics which could serve as a useful reference in the future I am sorry that I do not own an iPad to give you specific answers for that device but I am happy to share any knowledge I might have to help you sort things out  You have been amazingly helpful Coralbell All this must have taken you away from your own important work Thank you  Sorry about the confusion ZngabitanT and glad that you referenced my paragraph where I mention Droplet so that the differences are sorted out and now we welcome Mackerel to the Blip family!

I like the analogy with OS maps and 3D images From my point of view can central frequency and bandwidth along with similarity scores can be disregarded? Sorry I am still confused about peak frequency Is it as I originally thought the frequency of the peak or the frequency of peaks in one second? I have only just realised that individual columns can be sorted I presume only ascending I knew DYCWMI could be sorted I read this in Notes some time ago but stupidly hadn thought to apply it to the normal sim searches It was only in reply to another query that this was mentioned Are there any other tips relating to sim searches? It would be great if the photos of the glitches in the search results were horizontal as in the example rather than vertical Thank you!  Thank you very much for your patient help! The Q transform method based on GWPY seems to have limitations by the way do you know other ways to classify the glitches besides Q transform? When classifying is it usually based on the one dimensional timeseries data or based on the plots based on Q transform? In order Yes that's an example of Omicron having detected additional noise at high frequencies above the Hz top edge of our images in the case of but not in where the central frequency and bandwidth roughly agree with the height of the bliplet but the rectangle is wider than obviously necessary in the latter case the reported duration is seconds enclosing some faint stuff off to the side of the bliplet Probably yes The noisiest frequency the frequency bin where the distribution of noise vs frequency peaks Not the repetition rate of peaks To change from ascending to descending order click a second time on the same column heading The thumbnail pictures were arranged horizontally some years ago until people complained that this took up to much horizontal space and they had to scroll so far sideways to see the numbers Then the arrangement was changed to vertical and we have to scroll a longer way down the page of results Just can't please everyone! On a mobile device like an iPad or using the touchpad on a laptop scrolling horizontally or vertically is equally easy but vertical motions are easier than horizontal ones for people using a mouse with a little scroll wheel so they are better served by the present arrangement  Brilliant! Thank you very much ZngabitanT I must go and try out the sorting ascending and descending!  At the moment while the detection of real gravitational wave signals always relies on the raw timeseries data it has to the Q transform doesn't preserve enough information the classification of individual glitches still relies to a large extent on the Q transform images or even when the observatory operators need a quick overview just on the timestamp peak frequency and SNR without further classification in the form of cluster plots of the bulk distribution E from https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep !

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. The origins of glitches are usually related to factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists sometimes hypothesize more specific origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9FXMuRSWWwdtupxtxEd6ffXsdLq5k', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='### Analysis of Novel Elements in Talk Data Set 2 Relative to Talk Data Set 1:\n\n#### 1. New Glitch Classes Proposed:\nIn the provided Talk data set 2, there does not appear to be explicit mention of a newly proposed glitch class distinct from those discussed or existing in Talk data set 1. However, ongoing discussions and categorizations like "bliplet at 40hz," "19hz," and "fireball koi" suggest a continuous exploration and possibly nuanced understanding or subclassification within known categories, rather than completely new classes being identified.\n\n#### 2. Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes, Sensors, or Gravitational Wave Science:\n- **Question about Similarity Scores and Glitch Characteristics:** There is a question about whether central frequency, bandwidth, and similarity scores can be disregarded when glitches look similar despite having different reported values. This question arises from an observation where different glitches appeared similar but had different central frequencies and bandwidths. The reasoning behind this question is to understand the relevance and impact of these metrics on the visual similarity and classification of glitches.\n  \n- **Question about Alternative Classification Methods:** There is an inquiry about other methods to classify glitches besides using the Q transform. This reflects a desire to explore or validate other analytical techniques that might capture additional or different information from the Q transform, which is based on a time-frequency analysis method.\n  \n- **Operational Understanding of Q Transform:** Questions arise regarding the peak frequency—whether it refers to the frequency of the most intense noise or something else. This reflects a fundamental exploration into the technical definitions used in glitch analysis.\n\n#### 3. Hypotheses about Origins of Glitches:\n- **Environmental and Operational Factors:** There is an implicit hypothesis in the discussions about the impact of environmental and operational factors captured through auxiliary data channels (e.g., seismometers, magnetometers). The motivation here is to link observed glitch characteristics to specific environmental or operational states captured by auxiliary sensors, enhancing the understanding of causative factors.\n  \n- **Data Processing Artifacts:** Another hypothesis concerns data processing artifacts, especially in relation to how preprocessing steps might affect the visibility and characteristics of glitches in spectrogram images. This is particularly noted in the context of glitches occurring near lockloss events where the immense noise affects the preprocessing algorithm, leading to spectrograms that might not visually represent the glitch appropriately. The analytical motivation here is to understand how data processing influences glitch visualization and classification, potentially leading to misclassifications or insights into the robustness of current processing methods.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTalk data set 2 continues the trend seen in Talk data set 1 of deep engagement by citizen scientists with the classification and analysis of glitches in gravitational wave data. While no completely new glitch classes are proposed, there is evident progression in understanding existing classes more deeply, questioning classification metrics, and hypothesizing about glitch origins based on environmental, operational, and data processing contexts. These discussions are crucial for refining the understanding and classification of glitches, which in turn supports the broader scientific goals of gravitational wave astronomy.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713490216, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_c4e4d95913', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=613, prompt_tokens=12380, total_tokens=12993))

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards Now I need a new plan Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O so there is no hurry for this information just yet Thank you!

This is for future collections not existing ones I will carry on with cards until the collections are no longer needed I was just wondering about other column headings if any for the future I don want you to go to a lot of trouble!

Your list of columns looks good for starters I can think of one more thing I'm afraid will also be necessary a way to keep track of "subject X is a duplicate of subject Y" I'll be pleasantly surprised if we don't encounter some amount of duplication among subjects to be uploaded to Gravity Spy in the future And when multiple identical subjects are similar but not identical to a given one there's no guarantee that similarity search will return all of them nor that the lowest numbered subject will be among those returned The full set of duplicates will only be guaranteed to show up when we run a sim search from one of them and ask for sufficiently many results Some other points also for the benefit of future readers Be sure that you have a way to go back to yesterday's version of a spreadsheet when today's has accidentally got mangled or lost Make backups and verify that you can restore from a backup Cloud storage may be suitable here Objectives may expand there's no foretelling what new weird and wonderful glitches are going to show up during O Experiment with a small toy spreadsheet Can you add another column as an afterthought without breaking anything you were able to do with it before adding the column? An additional column won't need to be fully populated immediately for all the subject rows already in the spreadsheet there'll be plenty of further subjects added later and missing information about earlier subjects can be filled in occasionally General criteria for deciding what to include Anything you want to be able to search for g the subject number in case it comes up again anything you want to be able to sort by anything you want to be able to filter on in particular an indication whether the subject is "done" or still in your "to do" queue whether or not you have already fed it back to a similarity search Any column that changes from empty to non empty when you use a subject for a fresh search would suffice or you could use a marker for "to do" items and remove it when "done" and then anything you want to have at your fingertips without having to load the Zooniverse subject page anew or to run the collection through DYCWMI g Q value contributors who had brought up the subject in Talk or previously collected it peak frequency A column identifying the interferometer won't be needed when you plan on keeping separate spreadsheets for each site which has some advantages for all their similarities Hanford and Livingston have never had exactly the same glitch mix I've been mostly interested in bringing subjects into chronological order so for me the date time stamps when the subject was triggered were the first thing I started tracking after the subject numbers Other stuff Q value peak frequency SNR contributors free text annotations got added to my lists over the years as the need arose Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance I've also been keeping track of "zooid does not exist" cases subjects that had never made it into the Gravity Spy tools database You may not have a need for this such subjects can't come up among the results of similarity searches  Neither what I see here is a superposition blend of two probably unrelated glitches Like the Livingston tea light projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches are but this here is not a proper tea light either The peak frequency is reported as Hz so the dominant glitch is the loud triangular borderline between Tomte and Koi thing between about and Hz A Blip subclass varnish run glitch happened a few milliseconds earlier reaching down from the top to about Hz though not bright yellow all the way to the top thus a borderline member of this putative subclass But it's neither quite central nor the dominant feature  Yes we've had some of these occasionally during the third observing run Their first frames can look confusingly similar to those of Hz Line glitches But the latter never come in such wavy arrangements they happened once every minutes while they were happening during a brief period in April only  It's generally not necessary to annotate the obvious Gravity Spy is a bit too large for that with nearly two million active subjects and chance combinations hybrids aren't all that rare What I often do is add them to a suitable one of my collections instead But do feel free to bring up unusual subjects or questionable cases in Talk! Thanks for replying to me I did not notice silent edit If you were going to do small trial run with spreadsheets I was planning on outputting it in specific format along with improving tools myself what I do know is that what I cannot get from DYCWMI is timestamp currently today however once I can get character hash it's not too hard to be surprised might as well choose 'notes' to leave something as other attribute column something versatile It might also be good thing to keep columns that are added at a later date in separate tables and in reference form  Alas that was little too far away timestamp 10T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page L1O3b 10T qZ6QG6AUVf 10T 8EbipPoPhE 10T tLKzn BSz 10T BxQMjU99wP 10T hqzROquOji 10T 9T sj fT 10T I8B aJMm 10T 5g JVsO0v 10T dMaORGSEVF 10T ergyoE1d 10T 6 WfDf 10T sz J4GRTD H1O3b 10T 6lM JuHw 10T 8PXINsEGlW 10T i qIFE2LT 10T ttrO ak 10T Bigh Njd 10T A Q9OoV8s 10T bAP npSe 10T BdLsIWIkrZ 10T mAVlqqEnfK 10T jLevyNasU 10T 82BL7EJCJw 10T oIUwNkUNQW 10T tP42ZbJxwl 10T IhbdRR3Qtb 10T vCywMdcyaw 10T tsVFrDRMLj this 10T TmDzttAK same 10T gvy nGUfx same 10T GjSX5q Zx same 10T KHnuCyUP same 10T kaQueZGQTZ 10T qRiPEgJENO 10T OKfZyvgFwj 10T TWUK87S2w 10T NWF PmXEs 10T hmxyM2CMyh 10T r MvEWIJb 10T 8WezmJCFO 10T HJf hoXS 10T KKFYMRHM 10T FFoOHX7odG 10T IyEYxsfFil 10T Q036soLscL 10T RWzEPzcBpE 10T K MwfS3yx  Thank you very much ZngabitanT All my stuff gets backed up to the cloud every day Knowing me I will probably print out the data regularly Any duplicates I come across at the moment are on the individual sim searches I just write the numbers out and write delete next to all but the lowest number I keep all the sim search printouts making a note of the subject used for each search Should I type all these up in a word type document? With regard to the searches at the moment I have had primary secondary tertiary lists I initially looked at the bliplets collection and chose those subjects that look like raindrop I made a list of these subject and used each one at a time for a sim search All new raindrops I wrote next to the original subject until I had gone through that first list I then compiled a secondary list showing both the initial subject used for the search and the secondary subjects to be used for the next searches And so on ad nauseam! Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Now my brain hurts!  So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date?  There are many ways of doing things and many ways of organizing queues whatever works is fine > Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Yes but it's easier to not add them to a collection in the first place if the collection is intended to be representative of the timeline rather than to mark everything that matches its criteria than it is to find and remove them afterwards > So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date? Only if you're interested in the dates and times down to the minutes! I've been doing it especially for Virgo subjects because the Virgo subject numbers are much more scrambled out of chronological order than the LIGO ones Once as we all hope periodic uploads of recently recorded LIGO subjects resume for ER and O subjects coming from the same day will once again get numbers from a limited range and subjects coming from the next day will get higher numbers so the numbers will already provide an approximation to the date time stamps though they'll still be disordered on timescales of minutes and up to a few hours That'll be good enough for many purposes Glitch classes correlating with very bad windy weather will already stand out for example  An afterthought Also once periodic uploads of fresh subjects resume cascaded similarity searches will be less useful for a while than looking at the fresh subjects classifying as far as possible with the available classes while completely new things might be happening! and keeping an eye on what everyone else will be posting in Talk Sim Search isn't clairvoyant it can't yet see glitches that will happen only tomorrow The cascaded approach is more useful for exploring a realm of already uploaded subjects from past eras  I must admit it would be good to get back to some classifying before I completely forget what is what!  Agriculture and landscaping 46Hz around UTC   52Hz Pirate ship 05  41Hz around UTC Cuneiform  05Hz around UTC   41Hz around UTC Slightly cuneiform?  64Hz I expected a much higher frequency around UTC Artefact around 150Hz ? Pirate ship sailing on scattered light?  This dates from between and UTC it's the first subject from Virgo from that hour for which I've seen an approximate timestamp and in frame I spot artefact bands at least at and Hz plus that gradually fading feature near Hz where there ought to be a perfectly stationary never supposed to become visible as a transient spectral line associated with regulating the frequency wavelength of Virgo's main laser I'll bet there's something willow like just over the 2s edge a glitch originating in the laser amplifier and with overtone rich features with msec periodicity just what willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are but it must be either a very peculiar one that hasn't ever come up in a similarity search anchored on another of six hundred odd willows or else it's one that's missing from the Gravity Spy tools database Good catch in any case!  It nice to be back finding things like this again  Hi mitchnanny Regarding ZngabitanT's comment above > Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance While I cannot provide the specific instructions for an iPad as I do not use one here is an outline on how I work with spreadsheet software on a Windows laptop to manage sim searches and collections under study I first sort the sim search results original page by SNR either ascending or descending Then I download the Excel option of the search results as an xlsx file I rename the file with interferometer name era run and seed subject number Then I follow these general steps This is just an overview to give an idea on how I work without describing in detail all actions as you want to keep it simple Using a spreadsheet software I upload the downloaded xlsx file into a new spreadsheet I rename the spreadsheet with interferometer name era run glitch name under study and other information to find it back quickly The uploaded file appears in a new tab a sheet within the spreadsheet automatically formatted with all the columns from the sim search page I rename this tab with the seed subject number I mark the seed subject in the sheet Looking for multiple copies I look at the SNR column where the numbers appear already sorted I paint red those cells along subject number and keep them for future reference I keep the lowest multiple subject number for consistency and paint the cell blue for future reference Now I copy paste one by one the representative subject numbers find their corresponding GS page and see if they fit my collection In this way I can grow representative collections as the multiplicity issue has already been dealt with in the spreadsheet Still a double check is always essential before posting a collection to ensure that there are no multiple copies overlooked somewhere In this way the collection histogram will give a clean representation on glitch density I add an extra column to my sheets where I annotate whether a subject already exists in my collection or was newly added Hence I can pick better new seeds Here is where I discover borderline and possibly new glitches or those intrusively appearing in searches for instance H O Whistle on Blip ssp Trumpetfish For each sim search I also add to the sheet the corresponding histogram as an image insert Then I feed representative subject numbers from my sheet into loops of sim searches For each new search result I proceed as in the steps above download file with SNR already sorted create new sheet tab and name it accordingly look for multiple subject copies retrieve subject page grow collections pick aliens add histogram notes jot down questions and so on Repeat for each sim search performed In the end I ll have a whole spreadsheet file on a given interferometer and particular era or run for a given glitch study containing all the sim searches grouped under seed numbers tabs multiple subjects excluded lowest numbers picked all the subjects that I added to specific collections those discarded borderline and alien ones seeds fed to the ensuing sim searches all the histograms and several notes I create a new spreadsheet file for a new interferometer or a new era run that I want to perform sim searches upon by using the first sim search run then proceed as above So I have one file for each interferometer on a particular era run and also for the other interferometers accordingly I also used the spreadsheets for the Blip ssp Trumpetfish training sets and anything in between that needed to be looked upon A spreadsheet software may offer Insights charts like those I posted in my threads on the Trumpetfish investigation which give additional views and understanding on the data One thing that I found useful during the lengthy glitch investigation is that a spreadsheet gives a compact view of the sim search results without all the scrolling forth and back on the original page Also as I was doing moderate to large sim searches I could manage more than results when needed other times I had to test certain issues with the recommended maximum number of results It also allows for a detailed study of the other parameters while it is easy to sort filter and find values across sheets The spreadsheets helped me to keep a digital and retrievable history of the sim searches and findings seeds multiple subject numbers and lowest numbers picked the evolution of histograms notes and discoveries along the way I continue to use this method in my current investigations of several Blip potential subclasses So all this is just a glimpse on how I juggle sim searches and growing collections in a manageable and trackable way You can add to your sheets any column attribute you might find useful and over time you will feel what works best for you Spreadsheets have myriad functions and actions but you can keep it as simple as necessary to suit your needs Hope it helps it actually goes swiftly with practice There is this Apple tutorial Create a spreadsheet in Numbers on iPad https support apple com guide

The subsequent extremely loud noise associated with the lockloss in S has produced extensive data processing artefacts across the whole minute long data segment from which the spectrograms for these three Hanford subjects were produced The blips in S and in the present S are taller than they look they are half hidden behind the dark artefact bands This is best visible when looking at the fourth frames using the "half moon" button to toggle between normal and inverted colours also helps The relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions the lockloss but provides no further details about what caused it  Thank you Coralbell I will definitely have a few practise spreadsheets I will have to sort out some sort of filing system It is a bit fiddly on the iPad You mention adding the bar graph with the sim searches Does that have to be done via Imgur? I hope the answer is no !  Gladfully no haha! There must be an "Insert image" or similar function on your iPad spreadsheet Simply save the histogram image from GS to your device and then use the spreadsheet function to add it on your sheet  I downloaded the dataset from here BUT I doubt there are some instances in the "Extremely Loud" class that are misclassified !

What happened there is that the immense amount of noise just past the right edge upset the preprocessing whitening algorithm acting on the minute long data segment from which the seconds wide spectrograms were extracted The strain channel was already extremely noisy at time seconds but it then got a whole lot noisier over the next few seconds by several orders of magnitude and the algorithms used at the time reacted by producing very small numbers and very dark spectrogram colors for the seconds window we get to see This was pointed out a while later apropos of a similar subject from the second observing run the first use of the zerosignal hashtag in Gravity Spy Talk one of the comments there provides some further explanation projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 466268?comment Training the Machine Learning to recognize such nearly zero signal spectrograms as originating from events that truly are extremely loud it can't get any worse than the interferometer losing the lock! had been useful at the time even though it looks confusing at first glance to our human eyes Hope this sheds some light on the matter!  O Must resist temptation to mention punched cards on the TR  No access to one that I would be able to use for this That the beauty of the iPad it is always beside me ready for whatever comes next so I really want to make it work for this but it isn easy Mind you I won be doing cascading sim searches for some time yet so I will go back to my old much quicker ways with my bliplets I have learned a lot today and spent hours doing this At least I know I can download an excel file from a sim search to Numbers and add the graph I just mustn forget to create a zoo collection as well Enough!!! Thank you dear mitchnanny I am confident you will find yor way and am so glad again to hear that you learnt this much today  Hmmm it was too difficult to scour usual major giant corporate software instruction manuals and imagine what I needed todo to figure out steps to get necessary files and data together Best help possible for me was to create Linux like batch file assuming I wanted to process some data in shell scripts I was just a kid then as can be imagined in the days before release of Windows we picked it up from junk and built various ecosystems to use up last of computer's life and here we are today What now replaced spreadsheet was direct use of Relational DataBase engine a GNU software suite of traditional SQL language with no additional licensing required for older software manual sheets are still paper based no need to download huge PDFs using a paid internet connection and operating procedures have not changed from then to now This is biggest advantage we can continue to have all users process something in exactly the same way I'm envisioned discussing various glitched data using exactly same results in those ways!

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes! It involves a lot of tapping provided you have the correct bit highlighted Thank you Coralbell I have printed out the instructions I couldn find anything about it yesterday At least I know it can be done in Numbers I actually have all my sim searches for my main two collections kept as printouts in folders As I go on I get more organised with them so if necessary I can go back to them I cross reference from my index cards It only in the last few months I have been cascading or I imagine I have looking for raindrop and fly bliplets so have dozens of printouts  True Also the present subject is the only one from the group above that was rendered at  Oops I did forget sigh don't know what I was thinking about Thank you so much for reminding me and also for proposing the "blip subclass blip" Without your reference subjects and description I would have only added to the collection subjects that were taller than Hz  Blip and small fireball  fireball koi   sprites  repeating koi   bliplet at 40hz Glad to hear that you could find it and keeping the instructions handy is always a good idea Both links I sent you along this conversation refer to Numbers User Guide for iPad https support apple com guide numbers ipad welcome ipados There is a Table of Contents covering different help topics which could serve as a useful reference in the future I am sorry that I do not own an iPad to give you specific answers for that device but I am happy to share any knowledge I might have to help you sort things out  You have been amazingly helpful Coralbell All this must have taken you away from your own important work Thank you  Sorry about the confusion ZngabitanT and glad that you referenced my paragraph where I mention Droplet so that the differences are sorted out and now we welcome Mackerel to the Blip family! I am currently drafting my LIGO Blip Subclass Droplet findings and hopefully shall post it soon moving home and country has been challenging As we have now several Blip subspecies on the map who live nearby each other or in the same waters I made a list of the subspecies being looked into so far and added the peak frequency band as expressed in their own threads Some subspecies are still in their beginnings so their characteristics are yet to be defined but I think that it is good to have a clear idea altogether on where each one lies around so that we can better keep characterizing them I made the list below kindly reply with your input corrections or additions thank you in advance ZngabitanT and mitchnanny Note The xxs mean that I could not find a value mentioned or that it does not exist yet Quoting below ZngabitanT from different threads Blip ssp blip subclass formally proposed Hz Hz " can go as low as a little under Hz and as high as a little over Hz " here https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2758202?page scrollToLastComment true Blip ssp trumpetfish subclass formally proposed Hz Hz Peak frequencies cluster between and Hz and remain between about and Hz here https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Blip ssp varnish run under investigation Hz?

I like the analogy with OS maps and 3D images From my point of view can central frequency and bandwidth along with similarity scores can be disregarded? Sorry I am still confused about peak frequency Is it as I originally thought the frequency of the peak or the frequency of peaks in one second? I have only just realised that individual columns can be sorted I presume only ascending I knew DYCWMI could be sorted I read this in Notes some time ago but stupidly hadn thought to apply it to the normal sim searches It was only in reply to another query that this was mentioned Are there any other tips relating to sim searches? It would be great if the photos of the glitches in the search results were horizontal as in the example rather than vertical Thank you!  Thank you very much for your patient help! The Q transform method based on GWPY seems to have limitations by the way do you know other ways to classify the glitches besides Q transform? When classifying is it usually based on the one dimensional timeseries data or based on the plots based on Q transform? In order Yes that's an example of Omicron having detected additional noise at high frequencies above the Hz top edge of our images in the case of but not in where the central frequency and bandwidth roughly agree with the height of the bliplet but the rectangle is wider than obviously necessary in the latter case the reported duration is seconds enclosing some faint stuff off to the side of the bliplet Probably yes The noisiest frequency the frequency bin where the distribution of noise vs frequency peaks Not the repetition rate of peaks To change from ascending to descending order click a second time on the same column heading The thumbnail pictures were arranged horizontally some years ago until people complained that this took up to much horizontal space and they had to scroll so far sideways to see the numbers Then the arrangement was changed to vertical and we have to scroll a longer way down the page of results Just can't please everyone! On a mobile device like an iPad or using the touchpad on a laptop scrolling horizontally or vertically is equally easy but vertical motions are easier than horizontal ones for people using a mouse with a little scroll wheel so they are better served by the present arrangement  Brilliant! Thank you very much ZngabitanT I must go and try out the sorting ascending and descending!  At the moment while the detection of real gravitational wave signals always relies on the raw timeseries data it has to the Q transform doesn't preserve enough information the classification of individual glitches still relies to a large extent on the Q transform images or even when the observatory operators need a quick overview just on the timestamp peak frequency and SNR without further classification in the form of cluster plots of the bulk distribution E from https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep !

Note that this is a discussion forum associated with the Gravity Spy project on Zooniverse the authors of the gwpy software one of the underlying Python modules used by the Gravity Spy software do not participate here But I'll try to provide an answer based on my limited understanding of the topic The current algorithm which maps glitch noise energy levels to colors works roughly as follows It operates on a one minute long data segment at a time which may contain one or more glitch triggers that will be turned into constant Q transform images showing seconds long pieces of the data The one minute time frequency rectangle is subdivided into many small rectangular tiles and the noise energy in each tile is determined The highest noise energy percentile of any tile in the data segment is used to normalize the energies Then the energy levels from representing the lowest the background level to that highest level are mapped logarithmically to a scale from to and the gradations of this level normalized scale are represented by the hues of the colormap The numbers on the colorbar are simply the steps of on this normalized scale the number marks where on the range from to is So the colors in our images do not represent absolute noise energy levels the normalization will be different from one data segment to the next although it will be the same when multiple Gravity Spy subject images are extracted from one and the same data segment And thanks to this dynamic normalization there is not much truncation and thus not much information lost at high noise energy levels Only the very highest energy percentile of the tiles get painted bright yellow Hope this helps!

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. The origins of glitches are usually related to factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists sometimes hypothesize more specific origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

This naming suggests an observation of a unique waveform or pattern that resembles a dolphin shape, possibly indicating a new glitch type with distinct characteristics like frequency and amplitude that differentiate it from previously known classes.\n\n2. **Emerging Questions in Talk data set 2:**\n   - **Question about Sim Searches and Similarity Scores:** There\'s an inquiry on whether central frequency, bandwidth, and similarity scores are crucial metrics for categorizing glitches, particularly when glitches look similar but have different reported metrics. The citizen scientist questions the impact of these parameters in classifying and understanding glitches, suggesting a need for clearer explanations or more reliable methods.\n   - **Question about Q Transform Method Limitations:** A question is raised regarding the limitations of the Q transform method and if there are alternative ways to classify glitches besides using this method. This reflects a deeper dive into the technical aspects of data processing techniques used in gravitational wave science, indicating a progressive interest in the tools and methods employed in data analysis.\n\n3. **Specific Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk data set 2:**\n   - **Hypothesis on Lockloss Events:** A specific hypothesis is discussed regarding the origins of glitches associated with lockloss events, specifically mentioning glitches that occur a tenth of a second before disturbances in length and alignment sensing and control loops. The hypothesis suggests that these glitches may be triggered by instabilities or errors in the operational parameters of the sensors right before a lockloss, indicating a critical period where sensor readings may be particularly susceptible to producing glitches. This hypothesis shows a refined understanding of the sensor operations and their impact on data quality, suggesting that glitches can be critical indicators of underlying mechanical or operational issues.\n   - **Hypothesis on High Noise Energy Levels and Colorbar Adjustments:** Another hypothesis addresses the processing of glitch data concerning dynamic normalization of noise energy levels and the adjustment of colorbars in spectrogram images. This hypothesis questions how the normalization process might affect the visibility and classification of glitches, especially those with high energy levels. The analytical motivation here is to understand how data visualization techniques might influence the interpretation of glitch characteristics and whether any critical information is lost during the process. This reflects a sophisticated level of inquiry into the data handling and visualization practices in gravitational wave observations.\n\nThese points illustrate the evolving nature of citizen scientist engagement with glitch data, where deeper technical questions and hypotheses indicate a maturing understanding of the complexities involved in gravitational wave data analysis.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713490418, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_c4e4d95913', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=546, prompt_tokens=22597, total_tokens=23143))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards Now I need a new plan Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O so there is no hurry for this information just yet Thank you!

Standard crown is at Hz Hi mitchnanny I will include this in my task in the near future and will post it after tomorrow if I can get permission to use metadata from mitchnanny collection and plan to plot timestamps of merge with my own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page in addition to this I'm looking for different Q values in the previous and next subjects with some glitches from ' Fireballish with koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny livingston fireballish with koi ' collections  Hi Nicm of course you may use metadata from my collections The help I need is just in doing a basic spreadsheet in Numbers on the iPad nothing complicated! This is for future collections not existing ones I will carry on with cards until the collections are no longer needed I was just wondering about other column headings if any for the future I don want you to go to a lot of trouble!

Your list of columns looks good for starters I can think of one more thing I'm afraid will also be necessary a way to keep track of "subject X is a duplicate of subject Y" I'll be pleasantly surprised if we don't encounter some amount of duplication among subjects to be uploaded to Gravity Spy in the future And when multiple identical subjects are similar but not identical to a given one there's no guarantee that similarity search will return all of them nor that the lowest numbered subject will be among those returned The full set of duplicates will only be guaranteed to show up when we run a sim search from one of them and ask for sufficiently many results Some other points also for the benefit of future readers Be sure that you have a way to go back to yesterday's version of a spreadsheet when today's has accidentally got mangled or lost Make backups and verify that you can restore from a backup Cloud storage may be suitable here Objectives may expand there's no foretelling what new weird and wonderful glitches are going to show up during O Experiment with a small toy spreadsheet Can you add another column as an afterthought without breaking anything you were able to do with it before adding the column? An additional column won't need to be fully populated immediately for all the subject rows already in the spreadsheet there'll be plenty of further subjects added later and missing information about earlier subjects can be filled in occasionally General criteria for deciding what to include Anything you want to be able to search for g the subject number in case it comes up again anything you want to be able to sort by anything you want to be able to filter on in particular an indication whether the subject is "done" or still in your "to do" queue whether or not you have already fed it back to a similarity search Any column that changes from empty to non empty when you use a subject for a fresh search would suffice or you could use a marker for "to do" items and remove it when "done" and then anything you want to have at your fingertips without having to load the Zooniverse subject page anew or to run the collection through DYCWMI g Q value contributors who had brought up the subject in Talk or previously collected it peak frequency A column identifying the interferometer won't be needed when you plan on keeping separate spreadsheets for each site which has some advantages for all their similarities Hanford and Livingston have never had exactly the same glitch mix I've been mostly interested in bringing subjects into chronological order so for me the date time stamps when the subject was triggered were the first thing I started tracking after the subject numbers Other stuff Q value peak frequency SNR contributors free text annotations got added to my lists over the years as the need arose Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance I've also been keeping track of "zooid does not exist" cases subjects that had never made it into the Gravity Spy tools database You may not have a need for this such subjects can't come up among the results of similarity searches  Neither what I see here is a superposition blend of two probably unrelated glitches Like the Livingston tea light projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches are but this here is not a proper tea light either The peak frequency is reported as Hz so the dominant glitch is the loud triangular borderline between Tomte and Koi thing between about and Hz A Blip subclass varnish run glitch happened a few milliseconds earlier reaching down from the top to about Hz though not bright yellow all the way to the top thus a borderline member of this putative subclass But it's neither quite central nor the dominant feature  Yes we've had some of these occasionally during the third observing run Their first frames can look confusingly similar to those of Hz Line glitches But the latter never come in such wavy arrangements they happened once every minutes while they were happening during a brief period in April only  It's generally not necessary to annotate the obvious Gravity Spy is a bit too large for that with nearly two million active subjects and chance combinations hybrids aren't all that rare What I often do is add them to a suitable one of my collections instead But do feel free to bring up unusual subjects or questionable cases in Talk! Thanks for replying to me I did not notice silent edit If you were going to do small trial run with spreadsheets I was planning on outputting it in specific format along with improving tools myself what I do know is that what I cannot get from DYCWMI is timestamp currently today however once I can get character hash it's not too hard to be surprised might as well choose 'notes' to leave something as other attribute column something versatile It might also be good thing to keep columns that are added at a later date in separate tables and in reference form  Alas that was little too far away timestamp 10T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page L1O3b 10T qZ6QG6AUVf 10T 8EbipPoPhE 10T tLKzn BSz 10T BxQMjU99wP 10T hqzROquOji 10T 9T sj fT 10T I8B aJMm 10T 5g JVsO0v 10T dMaORGSEVF 10T ergyoE1d 10T 6 WfDf 10T sz J4GRTD H1O3b 10T 6lM JuHw 10T 8PXINsEGlW 10T i qIFE2LT 10T ttrO ak 10T Bigh Njd 10T A Q9OoV8s 10T bAP npSe 10T BdLsIWIkrZ 10T mAVlqqEnfK 10T jLevyNasU 10T 82BL7EJCJw 10T oIUwNkUNQW 10T tP42ZbJxwl 10T IhbdRR3Qtb 10T vCywMdcyaw 10T tsVFrDRMLj this 10T TmDzttAK same 10T gvy nGUfx same 10T GjSX5q Zx same 10T KHnuCyUP same 10T kaQueZGQTZ 10T qRiPEgJENO 10T OKfZyvgFwj 10T TWUK87S2w 10T NWF PmXEs 10T hmxyM2CMyh 10T r MvEWIJb 10T 8WezmJCFO 10T HJf hoXS 10T KKFYMRHM 10T FFoOHX7odG 10T IyEYxsfFil 10T Q036soLscL 10T RWzEPzcBpE 10T K MwfS3yx  Thank you very much ZngabitanT All my stuff gets backed up to the cloud every day Knowing me I will probably print out the data regularly Any duplicates I come across at the moment are on the individual sim searches I just write the numbers out and write delete next to all but the lowest number I keep all the sim search printouts making a note of the subject used for each search Should I type all these up in a word type document? With regard to the searches at the moment I have had primary secondary tertiary lists I initially looked at the bliplets collection and chose those subjects that look like raindrop I made a list of these subject and used each one at a time for a sim search All new raindrops I wrote next to the original subject until I had gone through that first list I then compiled a secondary list showing both the initial subject used for the search and the secondary subjects to be used for the next searches And so on ad nauseam! Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Now my brain hurts!  So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date?  There are many ways of doing things and many ways of organizing queues whatever works is fine > Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Yes but it's easier to not add them to a collection in the first place if the collection is intended to be representative of the timeline rather than to mark everything that matches its criteria than it is to find and remove them afterwards > So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date? Only if you're interested in the dates and times down to the minutes! I've been doing it especially for Virgo subjects because the Virgo subject numbers are much more scrambled out of chronological order than the LIGO ones Once as we all hope periodic uploads of recently recorded LIGO subjects resume for ER and O subjects coming from the same day will once again get numbers from a limited range and subjects coming from the next day will get higher numbers so the numbers will already provide an approximation to the date time stamps though they'll still be disordered on timescales of minutes and up to a few hours That'll be good enough for many purposes Glitch classes correlating with very bad windy weather will already stand out for example  An afterthought Also once periodic uploads of fresh subjects resume cascaded similarity searches will be less useful for a while than looking at the fresh subjects classifying as far as possible with the available classes while completely new things might be happening! and keeping an eye on what everyone else will be posting in Talk Sim Search isn't clairvoyant it can't yet see glitches that will happen only tomorrow The cascaded approach is more useful for exploring a realm of already uploaded subjects from past eras  I must admit it would be good to get back to some classifying before I completely forget what is what!  Agriculture and landscaping 46Hz around UTC   52Hz Pirate ship 05  41Hz around UTC Cuneiform  05Hz around UTC   41Hz around UTC Slightly cuneiform?  64Hz I expected a much higher frequency around UTC Artefact around 150Hz ? Pirate ship sailing on scattered light?  This dates from between and UTC it's the first subject from Virgo from that hour for which I've seen an approximate timestamp and in frame I spot artefact bands at least at and Hz plus that gradually fading feature near Hz where there ought to be a perfectly stationary never supposed to become visible as a transient spectral line associated with regulating the frequency wavelength of Virgo's main laser I'll bet there's something willow like just over the 2s edge a glitch originating in the laser amplifier and with overtone rich features with msec periodicity just what willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are but it must be either a very peculiar one that hasn't ever come up in a similarity search anchored on another of six hundred odd willows or else it's one that's missing from the Gravity Spy tools database Good catch in any case!  It nice to be back finding things like this again  Hi mitchnanny Regarding ZngabitanT's comment above > Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance While I cannot provide the specific instructions for an iPad as I do not use one here is an outline on how I work with spreadsheet software on a Windows laptop to manage sim searches and collections under study I first sort the sim search results original page by SNR either ascending or descending Then I download the Excel option of the search results as an xlsx file I rename the file with interferometer name era run and seed subject number Then I follow these general steps This is just an overview to give an idea on how I work without describing in detail all actions as you want to keep it simple Using a spreadsheet software I upload the downloaded xlsx file into a new spreadsheet I rename the spreadsheet with interferometer name era run glitch name under study and other information to find it back quickly The uploaded file appears in a new tab a sheet within the spreadsheet automatically formatted with all the columns from the sim search page I rename this tab with the seed subject number I mark the seed subject in the sheet Looking for multiple copies I look at the SNR column where the numbers appear already sorted I paint red those cells along subject number and keep them for future reference I keep the lowest multiple subject number for consistency and paint the cell blue for future reference Now I copy paste one by one the representative subject numbers find their corresponding GS page and see if they fit my collection In this way I can grow representative collections as the multiplicity issue has already been dealt with in the spreadsheet Still a double check is always essential before posting a collection to ensure that there are no multiple copies overlooked somewhere In this way the collection histogram will give a clean representation on glitch density I add an extra column to my sheets where I annotate whether a subject already exists in my collection or was newly added Hence I can pick better new seeds Here is where I discover borderline and possibly new glitches or those intrusively appearing in searches for instance H O Whistle on Blip ssp Trumpetfish For each sim search I also add to the sheet the corresponding histogram as an image insert Then I feed representative subject numbers from my sheet into loops of sim searches For each new search result I proceed as in the steps above download file with SNR already sorted create new sheet tab and name it accordingly look for multiple subject copies retrieve subject page grow collections pick aliens add histogram notes jot down questions and so on Repeat for each sim search performed In the end I ll have a whole spreadsheet file on a given interferometer and particular era or run for a given glitch study containing all the sim searches grouped under seed numbers tabs multiple subjects excluded lowest numbers picked all the subjects that I added to specific collections those discarded borderline and alien ones seeds fed to the ensuing sim searches all the histograms and several notes I create a new spreadsheet file for a new interferometer or a new era run that I want to perform sim searches upon by using the first sim search run then proceed as above So I have one file for each interferometer on a particular era run and also for the other interferometers accordingly I also used the spreadsheets for the Blip ssp Trumpetfish training sets and anything in between that needed to be looked upon A spreadsheet software may offer Insights charts like those I posted in my threads on the Trumpetfish investigation which give additional views and understanding on the data One thing that I found useful during the lengthy glitch investigation is that a spreadsheet gives a compact view of the sim search results without all the scrolling forth and back on the original page Also as I was doing moderate to large sim searches I could manage more than results when needed other times I had to test certain issues with the recommended maximum number of results It also allows for a detailed study of the other parameters while it is easy to sort filter and find values across sheets The spreadsheets helped me to keep a digital and retrievable history of the sim searches and findings seeds multiple subject numbers and lowest numbers picked the evolution of histograms notes and discoveries along the way I continue to use this method in my current investigations of several Blip potential subclasses So all this is just a glimpse on how I juggle sim searches and growing collections in a manageable and trackable way You can add to your sheets any column attribute you might find useful and over time you will feel what works best for you Spreadsheets have myriad functions and actions but you can keep it as simple as necessary to suit your needs Hope it helps it actually goes swiftly with practice There is this Apple tutorial Create a spreadsheet in Numbers on iPad https support apple com guide

Also I was able to download the excel file I normally just view then print to work on the search results and save it to Numbers It a start I have a long way to go but I am extremely grateful for what I have just learned from you It all a huge learning curve for me Thank you  Good morning mitchnanny glad to hear so I know you will be able to take what you need from my explanation and start your learning curve Take a look at the Apple tutorial I referenced above their guides use screenshots and it seems well explained While office management software has evolved much in the past decades they still keep the basic functions Regards You mean the image for the second frame was incomplete when it got shown to you? That could happen fortunately very rarely when the image file transmission from the Zooniverse cloud servers to your browser got stuck or got disrupted for some reason The file itself is OK showing a normal image to me now  This is Scattered Light la Virgo O Only the tops of the arches are bright enough to show up well and here the high Q processing has further stretched them horizontally and further subdued the flanks But the overall arrangement is characteristic  I'm not quite sure what it is either It could be a high Q rendering of an HFB or somewhat less likely an isolated brighter spot in a very faint whistle Calling it NOTA when neither option looks convincing is a safe alternative  There is a proposed glitch class for this whistle variant Gnarly Whistle projects zooniverse gravity spy talk so they can also be classified as None Of The Above while the proposal is pending For once the nickname had been given by the LIGO engineers themselves not by our volunteer community  Wonderful mitchnanny I am so happy that I could be of help and yours is a great starting point Allow me to suggest a learning approach You may resume re learning spreadsheets by creating yourself a simple file with just two or three columns in a tab filled with some words and numbers Then practise adding removing sorting searching renaming painting all the basic actions Then add another tab fill it in and try searching the whole spreadsheet for a number or word Then continue with very small sim searches results downloaded so that you feel in control of the sheet while mastering already the basic functions One step at a time my friend! The subsequent extremely loud noise associated with the lockloss in S has produced extensive data processing artefacts across the whole minute long data segment from which the spectrograms for these three Hanford subjects were produced The blips in S and in the present S are taller than they look they are half hidden behind the dark artefact bands This is best visible when looking at the fourth frames using the "half moon" button to toggle between normal and inverted colours also helps The relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions the lockloss but provides no further details about what caused it  Thank you Coralbell I will definitely have a few practise spreadsheets I will have to sort out some sort of filing system It is a bit fiddly on the iPad You mention adding the bar graph with the sim searches Does that have to be done via Imgur? I hope the answer is no !  Gladfully no haha! There must be an "Insert image" or similar function on your iPad spreadsheet Simply save the histogram image from GS to your device and then use the spreadsheet function to add it on your sheet  I downloaded the dataset from here BUT I doubt there are some instances in the "Extremely Loud" class that are misclassified !

Yes instead save the csv and edit it with vi editor Almost years old system and now IBM may helps  Aaaaaargh! I have managed to save a sim search to Numbers plus bar chart but forgot to create a collection I thought I could go back with the back arrow but the collection had different subject numbers I have huge problems creating folders in the right place and I don want hundreds of individual sim searches floating around Just as I think I have created a folder and saved something into it I can find it again Stuff can be saved to the iPad or the cloud but ultimately it all gets backed up to the cloud I have had desktop computers in the past but prefer the iPad for most of my uses I intend to replace it some time and may get an external keyboard If all else fails it back to the cards!!! One more attempt at this wretched bliplets sim search then that it! Definitely a G T evening coming up! Hi Nicm in the VERY dim and distant past when I was working with medical records it was a Linux system so I have at least heard of it!

What happened there is that the immense amount of noise just past the right edge upset the preprocessing whitening algorithm acting on the minute long data segment from which the seconds wide spectrograms were extracted The strain channel was already extremely noisy at time seconds but it then got a whole lot noisier over the next few seconds by several orders of magnitude and the algorithms used at the time reacted by producing very small numbers and very dark spectrogram colors for the seconds window we get to see This was pointed out a while later apropos of a similar subject from the second observing run the first use of the zerosignal hashtag in Gravity Spy Talk one of the comments there provides some further explanation projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 466268?comment Training the Machine Learning to recognize such nearly zero signal spectrograms as originating from events that truly are extremely loud it can't get any worse than the interferometer losing the lock! had been useful at the time even though it looks confusing at first glance to our human eyes Hope this sheds some light on the matter!

Thank you dear mitchnanny I am confident you will find yor way and am so glad again to hear that you learnt this much today  Hmmm it was too difficult to scour usual major giant corporate software instruction manuals and imagine what I needed todo to figure out steps to get necessary files and data together Best help possible for me was to create Linux like batch file assuming I wanted to process some data in shell scripts I was just a kid then as can be imagined in the days before release of Windows we picked it up from junk and built various ecosystems to use up last of computer's life and here we are today What now replaced spreadsheet was direct use of Relational DataBase engine a GNU software suite of traditional SQL language with no additional licensing required for older software manual sheets are still paper based no need to download huge PDFs using a paid internet connection and operating procedures have not changed from then to now This is biggest advantage we can continue to have all users process something in exactly the same way I'm envisioned discussing various glitched data using exactly same results in those ways!

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes! It involves a lot of tapping provided you have the correct bit highlighted Thank you Coralbell I have printed out the instructions I couldn find anything about it yesterday At least I know it can be done in Numbers I actually have all my sim searches for my main two collections kept as printouts in folders As I go on I get more organised with them so if necessary I can go back to them I cross reference from my index cards It only in the last few months I have been cascading or I imagine I have looking for raindrop and fly bliplets so have dozens of printouts  True Also the present subject is the only one from the group above that was rendered at  Oops I did forget sigh don't know what I was thinking about Thank you so much for reminding me and also for proposing the "blip subclass blip" Without your reference subjects and description I would have only added to the collection subjects that were taller than Hz  Blip and small fireball  fireball koi   sprites  repeating koi   bliplet at 40hz Glad to hear that you could find it and keeping the instructions handy is always a good idea Both links I sent you along this conversation refer to Numbers User Guide for iPad https support apple com guide numbers ipad welcome ipados There is a Table of Contents covering different help topics which could serve as a useful reference in the future I am sorry that I do not own an iPad to give you specific answers for that device but I am happy to share any knowledge I might have to help you sort things out  You have been amazingly helpful Coralbell All this must have taken you away from your own important work Thank you  Sorry about the confusion ZngabitanT and glad that you referenced my paragraph where I mention Droplet so that the differences are sorted out and now we welcome Mackerel to the Blip family!

I like the analogy with OS maps and 3D images From my point of view can central frequency and bandwidth along with similarity scores can be disregarded? Sorry I am still confused about peak frequency Is it as I originally thought the frequency of the peak or the frequency of peaks in one second? I have only just realised that individual columns can be sorted I presume only ascending I knew DYCWMI could be sorted I read this in Notes some time ago but stupidly hadn thought to apply it to the normal sim searches It was only in reply to another query that this was mentioned Are there any other tips relating to sim searches? It would be great if the photos of the glitches in the search results were horizontal as in the example rather than vertical Thank you!  Thank you very much for your patient help! The Q transform method based on GWPY seems to have limitations by the way do you know other ways to classify the glitches besides Q transform? When classifying is it usually based on the one dimensional timeseries data or based on the plots based on Q transform? In order Yes that's an example of Omicron having detected additional noise at high frequencies above the Hz top edge of our images in the case of but not in where the central frequency and bandwidth roughly agree with the height of the bliplet but the rectangle is wider than obviously necessary in the latter case the reported duration is seconds enclosing some faint stuff off to the side of the bliplet Probably yes The noisiest frequency the frequency bin where the distribution of noise vs frequency peaks Not the repetition rate of peaks To change from ascending to descending order click a second time on the same column heading The thumbnail pictures were arranged horizontally some years ago until people complained that this took up to much horizontal space and they had to scroll so far sideways to see the numbers Then the arrangement was changed to vertical and we have to scroll a longer way down the page of results Just can't please everyone! On a mobile device like an iPad or using the touchpad on a laptop scrolling horizontally or vertically is equally easy but vertical motions are easier than horizontal ones for people using a mouse with a little scroll wheel so they are better served by the present arrangement  Brilliant! Thank you very much ZngabitanT I must go and try out the sorting ascending and descending!  At the moment while the detection of real gravitational wave signals always relies on the raw timeseries data it has to the Q transform doesn't preserve enough information the classification of individual glitches still relies to a large extent on the Q transform images or even when the observatory operators need a quick overview just on the timestamp peak frequency and SNR without further classification in the form of cluster plots of the bulk distribution E from https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep !

Note that this is a discussion forum associated with the Gravity Spy project on Zooniverse the authors of the gwpy software one of the underlying Python modules used by the Gravity Spy software do not participate here But I'll try to provide an answer based on my limited understanding of the topic The current algorithm which maps glitch noise energy levels to colors works roughly as follows It operates on a one minute long data segment at a time which may contain one or more glitch triggers that will be turned into constant Q transform images showing seconds long pieces of the data The one minute time frequency rectangle is subdivided into many small rectangular tiles and the noise energy in each tile is determined The highest noise energy percentile of any tile in the data segment is used to normalize the energies Then the energy levels from representing the lowest the background level to that highest level are mapped logarithmically to a scale from to and the gradations of this level normalized scale are represented by the hues of the colormap The numbers on the colorbar are simply the steps of on this normalized scale the number marks where on the range from to is So the colors in our images do not represent absolute noise energy levels the normalization will be different from one data segment to the next although it will be the same when multiple Gravity Spy subject images are extracted from one and the same data segment And thanks to this dynamic normalization there is not much truncation and thus not much information lost at high noise energy levels Only the very highest energy percentile of the tiles get painted bright yellow Hope this helps!

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. The origins of glitches are usually related to factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists sometimes hypothesize more specific origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Data Set 2\nFrom the conversations in Talk data set 2, several new glitch classes and subclasses are discussed, though some may overlap or be related to known classes. Here are notable mentions:\n- **Dolphin Shape Glitch** - Mentioned casually with an ambiguity in its description; this could be exploring a unique shape or pattern observed in the glitch, resembling a dolphin.\n- **Chirpish Blip** - A variant of the known Blip class is suggested, characterized by a frequency pattern that resembles a Chirp but within the context of a Blip glitch. The distinction seems to lie in the frequency behavior.\n- **Tadpole Class** - A metaphorical descriptor used by citizen scientists to describe a glitch with characteristics reminiscent of a tadpole’s shape. This description could correlate with a specific frequency and energy distribution pattern.\n\nThese discussions indicate a deepening engagement with nuanced features within known glitch categories or potential new categories based on observed data.\n\n#### 2. Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects\nCitizen scientists in Talk data set 2 raise questions that reflect a more profound technical engagement with the data:\n- **Central Frequency and Bandwidth Implications** - There is confusion regarding whether central frequency and bandwidth should be considered when categorizing glitches, reflecting a deeper dive into the technical aspects of data analysis.\n- **Q Transform Limitations** - Questions are raised about the limitations of the Q transform method and whether other classification methods exist, indicating a quest to understand the data processing tools better.\n- **Glitch Image Orientation in Sim Searches** - Queries about the practical aspects of data presentation, such as the orientation of glitch images in simulation search results, show a desire for more efficient data analysis.\n\nThese questions suggest an evolving understanding of the complex data analysis techniques employed in gravitational wave research, pushing for more refined tools and methods.\n\n#### 3. Hypotheses About Origins of Glitches\nIn Talk data set 2, more specific hypotheses about the origins of glitches are discussed:\n- **Lockloss Events** - Several instances where glitches correlate with lockloss events in the detectors are noted, suggesting a hypothesis that these glitches might be indicators or by-products of such events.\n- **Environmental and Instrumental Factors** - Discussions include how environmental factors (like weather conditions) or specific operational modes of the detectors might influence the occurrence of certain glitches. This reflects an analytical approach to correlating external conditions with glitch occurrences.\n\nThe analytical motivations behind these hypotheses seem to be rooted in a desire to correlate the presence of glitches with observable or known operational states of the detectors, potentially leading to better predictive models for glitch occurrences.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe discussions in Talk data set 2 show a progression from basic identification and categorization of glitches (as seen in Talk data set 1) to a deeper, more technically informed engagement with the data. This involves proposing new glitch classes based on more detailed observations, asking more technical and operational questions about data analysis methods, and hypothesizing about the origins of glitches with a greater focus on the detectors' operational context and environmental interactions. This evolution reflects a maturing of the citizen scientists' collective understanding and their increasing capacity to contribute to the field of gravitational wave astronomy.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713491086, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_c4e4d95913', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=678, prompt_tokens=22767, total_tokens=23445))

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards Now I need a new plan Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O so there is no hurry for this information just yet Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nicm I like being able to see the two "near time subjects" I guess this one can be classified as fireball koi instead of repeating koi  Correction there doesn't seem to be a koi so only fireballs     bliplet at 40hz plus four other smaller features   fireball koi  Clair de lune?  bliplet at 40hz  fireball koi   19hz braid  crown at Q5? 19hz  candle  Hz not long enough to qualify as Hz line   bliplet at 40hz  483hz line  ZngabitanT Would this one qualify as borderline varnish run blip or should it be a borderline varnish run koi? Crowns at Q22?  coronet  repeating koi   20hz  bliplet at 40hz  koi fireball at Q11 Strange high frequency crown ? Standard crown is at Hz Hi mitchnanny I will include this in my task in the near future and will post it after tomorrow if I can get permission to use metadata from mitchnanny collection and plan to plot timestamps of merge with my own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page in addition to this I'm looking for different Q values in the previous and next subjects with some glitches from ' Fireballish with koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny livingston fireballish with koi ' collections  Hi Nicm of course you may use metadata from my collections The help I need is just in doing a basic spreadsheet in Numbers on the iPad nothing complicated! This is for future collections not existing ones I will carry on with cards until the collections are no longer needed I was just wondering about other column headings if any for the future I don want you to go to a lot of trouble!

Your list of columns looks good for starters I can think of one more thing I'm afraid will also be necessary a way to keep track of "subject X is a duplicate of subject Y" I'll be pleasantly surprised if we don't encounter some amount of duplication among subjects to be uploaded to Gravity Spy in the future And when multiple identical subjects are similar but not identical to a given one there's no guarantee that similarity search will return all of them nor that the lowest numbered subject will be among those returned The full set of duplicates will only be guaranteed to show up when we run a sim search from one of them and ask for sufficiently many results Some other points also for the benefit of future readers Be sure that you have a way to go back to yesterday's version of a spreadsheet when today's has accidentally got mangled or lost Make backups and verify that you can restore from a backup Cloud storage may be suitable here Objectives may expand there's no foretelling what new weird and wonderful glitches are going to show up during O Experiment with a small toy spreadsheet Can you add another column as an afterthought without breaking anything you were able to do with it before adding the column? An additional column won't need to be fully populated immediately for all the subject rows already in the spreadsheet there'll be plenty of further subjects added later and missing information about earlier subjects can be filled in occasionally General criteria for deciding what to include Anything you want to be able to search for g the subject number in case it comes up again anything you want to be able to sort by anything you want to be able to filter on in particular an indication whether the subject is "done" or still in your "to do" queue whether or not you have already fed it back to a similarity search Any column that changes from empty to non empty when you use a subject for a fresh search would suffice or you could use a marker for "to do" items and remove it when "done" and then anything you want to have at your fingertips without having to load the Zooniverse subject page anew or to run the collection through DYCWMI g Q value contributors who had brought up the subject in Talk or previously collected it peak frequency A column identifying the interferometer won't be needed when you plan on keeping separate spreadsheets for each site which has some advantages for all their similarities Hanford and Livingston have never had exactly the same glitch mix I've been mostly interested in bringing subjects into chronological order so for me the date time stamps when the subject was triggered were the first thing I started tracking after the subject numbers Other stuff Q value peak frequency SNR contributors free text annotations got added to my lists over the years as the need arose Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance I've also been keeping track of "zooid does not exist" cases subjects that had never made it into the Gravity Spy tools database You may not have a need for this such subjects can't come up among the results of similarity searches  Neither what I see here is a superposition blend of two probably unrelated glitches Like the Livingston tea light projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches are but this here is not a proper tea light either The peak frequency is reported as Hz so the dominant glitch is the loud triangular borderline between Tomte and Koi thing between about and Hz A Blip subclass varnish run glitch happened a few milliseconds earlier reaching down from the top to about Hz though not bright yellow all the way to the top thus a borderline member of this putative subclass But it's neither quite central nor the dominant feature  Yes we've had some of these occasionally during the third observing run Their first frames can look confusingly similar to those of Hz Line glitches But the latter never come in such wavy arrangements they happened once every minutes while they were happening during a brief period in April only  It's generally not necessary to annotate the obvious Gravity Spy is a bit too large for that with nearly two million active subjects and chance combinations hybrids aren't all that rare What I often do is add them to a suitable one of my collections instead But do feel free to bring up unusual subjects or questionable cases in Talk! Thanks for replying to me I did not notice silent edit If you were going to do small trial run with spreadsheets I was planning on outputting it in specific format along with improving tools myself what I do know is that what I cannot get from DYCWMI is timestamp currently today however once I can get character hash it's not too hard to be surprised might as well choose 'notes' to leave something as other attribute column something versatile It might also be good thing to keep columns that are added at a later date in separate tables and in reference form  Alas that was little too far away timestamp 10T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page L1O3b 10T qZ6QG6AUVf 10T 8EbipPoPhE 10T tLKzn BSz 10T BxQMjU99wP 10T hqzROquOji 10T 9T sj fT 10T I8B aJMm 10T 5g JVsO0v 10T dMaORGSEVF 10T ergyoE1d 10T 6 WfDf 10T sz J4GRTD H1O3b 10T 6lM JuHw 10T 8PXINsEGlW 10T i qIFE2LT 10T ttrO ak 10T Bigh Njd 10T A Q9OoV8s 10T bAP npSe 10T BdLsIWIkrZ 10T mAVlqqEnfK 10T jLevyNasU 10T 82BL7EJCJw 10T oIUwNkUNQW 10T tP42ZbJxwl 10T IhbdRR3Qtb 10T vCywMdcyaw 10T tsVFrDRMLj this 10T TmDzttAK same 10T gvy nGUfx same 10T GjSX5q Zx same 10T KHnuCyUP same 10T kaQueZGQTZ 10T qRiPEgJENO 10T OKfZyvgFwj 10T TWUK87S2w 10T NWF PmXEs 10T hmxyM2CMyh 10T r MvEWIJb 10T 8WezmJCFO 10T HJf hoXS 10T KKFYMRHM 10T FFoOHX7odG 10T IyEYxsfFil 10T Q036soLscL 10T RWzEPzcBpE 10T K MwfS3yx  Thank you very much ZngabitanT All my stuff gets backed up to the cloud every day Knowing me I will probably print out the data regularly Any duplicates I come across at the moment are on the individual sim searches I just write the numbers out and write delete next to all but the lowest number I keep all the sim search printouts making a note of the subject used for each search Should I type all these up in a word type document? With regard to the searches at the moment I have had primary secondary tertiary lists I initially looked at the bliplets collection and chose those subjects that look like raindrop I made a list of these subject and used each one at a time for a sim search All new raindrops I wrote next to the original subject until I had gone through that first list I then compiled a secondary list showing both the initial subject used for the search and the secondary subjects to be used for the next searches And so on ad nauseam! Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Now my brain hurts!  So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date?  There are many ways of doing things and many ways of organizing queues whatever works is fine > Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Yes but it's easier to not add them to a collection in the first place if the collection is intended to be representative of the timeline rather than to mark everything that matches its criteria than it is to find and remove them afterwards > So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date? Only if you're interested in the dates and times down to the minutes! I've been doing it especially for Virgo subjects because the Virgo subject numbers are much more scrambled out of chronological order than the LIGO ones Once as we all hope periodic uploads of recently recorded LIGO subjects resume for ER and O subjects coming from the same day will once again get numbers from a limited range and subjects coming from the next day will get higher numbers so the numbers will already provide an approximation to the date time stamps though they'll still be disordered on timescales of minutes and up to a few hours That'll be good enough for many purposes Glitch classes correlating with very bad windy weather will already stand out for example  An afterthought Also once periodic uploads of fresh subjects resume cascaded similarity searches will be less useful for a while than looking at the fresh subjects classifying as far as possible with the available classes while completely new things might be happening! and keeping an eye on what everyone else will be posting in Talk Sim Search isn't clairvoyant it can't yet see glitches that will happen only tomorrow The cascaded approach is more useful for exploring a realm of already uploaded subjects from past eras  I must admit it would be good to get back to some classifying before I completely forget what is what!  Agriculture and landscaping 46Hz around UTC   52Hz Pirate ship 05  41Hz around UTC Cuneiform  05Hz around UTC   41Hz around UTC Slightly cuneiform?  64Hz I expected a much higher frequency around UTC Artefact around 150Hz ? Pirate ship sailing on scattered light?  This dates from between and UTC it's the first subject from Virgo from that hour for which I've seen an approximate timestamp and in frame I spot artefact bands at least at and Hz plus that gradually fading feature near Hz where there ought to be a perfectly stationary never supposed to become visible as a transient spectral line associated with regulating the frequency wavelength of Virgo's main laser I'll bet there's something willow like just over the 2s edge a glitch originating in the laser amplifier and with overtone rich features with msec periodicity just what willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are but it must be either a very peculiar one that hasn't ever come up in a similarity search anchored on another of six hundred odd willows or else it's one that's missing from the Gravity Spy tools database Good catch in any case!  It nice to be back finding things like this again  Hi mitchnanny Regarding ZngabitanT's comment above > Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance While I cannot provide the specific instructions for an iPad as I do not use one here is an outline on how I work with spreadsheet software on a Windows laptop to manage sim searches and collections under study I first sort the sim search results original page by SNR either ascending or descending Then I download the Excel option of the search results as an xlsx file I rename the file with interferometer name era run and seed subject number Then I follow these general steps This is just an overview to give an idea on how I work without describing in detail all actions as you want to keep it simple Using a spreadsheet software I upload the downloaded xlsx file into a new spreadsheet I rename the spreadsheet with interferometer name era run glitch name under study and other information to find it back quickly The uploaded file appears in a new tab a sheet within the spreadsheet automatically formatted with all the columns from the sim search page I rename this tab with the seed subject number I mark the seed subject in the sheet Looking for multiple copies I look at the SNR column where the numbers appear already sorted I paint red those cells along subject number and keep them for future reference I keep the lowest multiple subject number for consistency and paint the cell blue for future reference Now I copy paste one by one the representative subject numbers find their corresponding GS page and see if they fit my collection In this way I can grow representative collections as the multiplicity issue has already been dealt with in the spreadsheet Still a double check is always essential before posting a collection to ensure that there are no multiple copies overlooked somewhere In this way the collection histogram will give a clean representation on glitch density I add an extra column to my sheets where I annotate whether a subject already exists in my collection or was newly added Hence I can pick better new seeds Here is where I discover borderline and possibly new glitches or those intrusively appearing in searches for instance H O Whistle on Blip ssp Trumpetfish For each sim search I also add to the sheet the corresponding histogram as an image insert Then I feed representative subject numbers from my sheet into loops of sim searches For each new search result I proceed as in the steps above download file with SNR already sorted create new sheet tab and name it accordingly look for multiple subject copies retrieve subject page grow collections pick aliens add histogram notes jot down questions and so on Repeat for each sim search performed In the end I ll have a whole spreadsheet file on a given interferometer and particular era or run for a given glitch study containing all the sim searches grouped under seed numbers tabs multiple subjects excluded lowest numbers picked all the subjects that I added to specific collections those discarded borderline and alien ones seeds fed to the ensuing sim searches all the histograms and several notes I create a new spreadsheet file for a new interferometer or a new era run that I want to perform sim searches upon by using the first sim search run then proceed as above So I have one file for each interferometer on a particular era run and also for the other interferometers accordingly I also used the spreadsheets for the Blip ssp Trumpetfish training sets and anything in between that needed to be looked upon A spreadsheet software may offer Insights charts like those I posted in my threads on the Trumpetfish investigation which give additional views and understanding on the data One thing that I found useful during the lengthy glitch investigation is that a spreadsheet gives a compact view of the sim search results without all the scrolling forth and back on the original page Also as I was doing moderate to large sim searches I could manage more than results when needed other times I had to test certain issues with the recommended maximum number of results It also allows for a detailed study of the other parameters while it is easy to sort filter and find values across sheets The spreadsheets helped me to keep a digital and retrievable history of the sim searches and findings seeds multiple subject numbers and lowest numbers picked the evolution of histograms notes and discoveries along the way I continue to use this method in my current investigations of several Blip potential subclasses So all this is just a glimpse on how I juggle sim searches and growing collections in a manageable and trackable way You can add to your sheets any column attribute you might find useful and over time you will feel what works best for you Spreadsheets have myriad functions and actions but you can keep it as simple as necessary to suit your needs Hope it helps it actually goes swiftly with practice There is this Apple tutorial Create a spreadsheet in Numbers on iPad https support apple com guide

The subsequent extremely loud noise associated with the lockloss in S has produced extensive data processing artefacts across the whole minute long data segment from which the spectrograms for these three Hanford subjects were produced The blips in S and in the present S are taller than they look they are half hidden behind the dark artefact bands This is best visible when looking at the fourth frames using the "half moon" button to toggle between normal and inverted colours also helps The relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions the lockloss but provides no further details about what caused it  Thank you Coralbell I will definitely have a few practise spreadsheets I will have to sort out some sort of filing system It is a bit fiddly on the iPad You mention adding the bar graph with the sim searches Does that have to be done via Imgur? I hope the answer is no !  Gladfully no haha! There must be an "Insert image" or similar function on your iPad spreadsheet Simply save the histogram image from GS to your device and then use the spreadsheet function to add it on your sheet  I downloaded the dataset from here BUT I doubt there are some instances in the "Extremely Loud" class that are misclassified ! Example https imgloc com lKYT Is that true? How can we correct those instances? ! Example Alt Text https xyz lKYT png  Thank goodness for that!

Yes instead save the csv and edit it with vi editor Almost years old system and now IBM may helps  Aaaaaargh! I have managed to save a sim search to Numbers plus bar chart but forgot to create a collection I thought I could go back with the back arrow but the collection had different subject numbers I have huge problems creating folders in the right place and I don want hundreds of individual sim searches floating around Just as I think I have created a folder and saved something into it I can find it again Stuff can be saved to the iPad or the cloud but ultimately it all gets backed up to the cloud I have had desktop computers in the past but prefer the iPad for most of my uses I intend to replace it some time and may get an external keyboard If all else fails it back to the cards!!! One more attempt at this wretched bliplets sim search then that it! Definitely a G T evening coming up! Hi Nicm in the VERY dim and distant past when I was working with medical records it was a Linux system so I have at least heard of it!

What happened there is that the immense amount of noise just past the right edge upset the preprocessing whitening algorithm acting on the minute long data segment from which the seconds wide spectrograms were extracted The strain channel was already extremely noisy at time seconds but it then got a whole lot noisier over the next few seconds by several orders of magnitude and the algorithms used at the time reacted by producing very small numbers and very dark spectrogram colors for the seconds window we get to see This was pointed out a while later apropos of a similar subject from the second observing run the first use of the zerosignal hashtag in Gravity Spy Talk one of the comments there provides some further explanation projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 466268?comment Training the Machine Learning to recognize such nearly zero signal spectrograms as originating from events that truly are extremely loud it can't get any worse than the interferometer losing the lock! had been useful at the time even though it looks confusing at first glance to our human eyes Hope this sheds some light on the matter!  O Must resist temptation to mention punched cards on the TR  No access to one that I would be able to use for this That the beauty of the iPad it is always beside me ready for whatever comes next so I really want to make it work for this but it isn easy Mind you I won be doing cascading sim searches for some time yet so I will go back to my old much quicker ways with my bliplets I have learned a lot today and spent hours doing this At least I know I can download an excel file from a sim search to Numbers and add the graph I just mustn forget to create a zoo collection as well Enough!!! Thank you dear mitchnanny I am confident you will find yor way and am so glad again to hear that you learnt this much today  Hmmm it was too difficult to scour usual major giant corporate software instruction manuals and imagine what I needed todo to figure out steps to get necessary files and data together Best help possible for me was to create Linux like batch file assuming I wanted to process some data in shell scripts I was just a kid then as can be imagined in the days before release of Windows we picked it up from junk and built various ecosystems to use up last of computer's life and here we are today What now replaced spreadsheet was direct use of Relational DataBase engine a GNU software suite of traditional SQL language with no additional licensing required for older software manual sheets are still paper based no need to download huge PDFs using a paid internet connection and operating procedures have not changed from then to now This is biggest advantage we can continue to have all users process something in exactly the same way I'm envisioned discussing various glitched data using exactly same results in those ways!

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes! It involves a lot of tapping provided you have the correct bit highlighted Thank you Coralbell I have printed out the instructions I couldn find anything about it yesterday At least I know it can be done in Numbers I actually have all my sim searches for my main two collections kept as printouts in folders As I go on I get more organised with them so if necessary I can go back to them I cross reference from my index cards It only in the last few months I have been cascading or I imagine I have looking for raindrop and fly bliplets so have dozens of printouts  True Also the present subject is the only one from the group above that was rendered at  Oops I did forget sigh don't know what I was thinking about Thank you so much for reminding me and also for proposing the "blip subclass blip" Without your reference subjects and description I would have only added to the collection subjects that were taller than Hz  Blip and small fireball  fireball koi   sprites  repeating koi   bliplet at 40hz Glad to hear that you could find it and keeping the instructions handy is always a good idea Both links I sent you along this conversation refer to Numbers User Guide for iPad https support apple com guide numbers ipad welcome ipados There is a Table of Contents covering different help topics which could serve as a useful reference in the future I am sorry that I do not own an iPad to give you specific answers for that device but I am happy to share any knowledge I might have to help you sort things out  You have been amazingly helpful Coralbell All this must have taken you away from your own important work Thank you  Sorry about the confusion ZngabitanT and glad that you referenced my paragraph where I mention Droplet so that the differences are sorted out and now we welcome Mackerel to the Blip family! I am currently drafting my LIGO Blip Subclass Droplet findings and hopefully shall post it soon moving home and country has been challenging As we have now several Blip subspecies on the map who live nearby each other or in the same waters I made a list of the subspecies being looked into so far and added the peak frequency band as expressed in their own threads Some subspecies are still in their beginnings so their characteristics are yet to be defined but I think that it is good to have a clear idea altogether on where each one lies around so that we can better keep characterizing them I made the list below kindly reply with your input corrections or additions thank you in advance ZngabitanT and mitchnanny Note The xxs mean that I could not find a value mentioned or that it does not exist yet Quoting below ZngabitanT from different threads Blip ssp blip subclass formally proposed Hz Hz " can go as low as a little under Hz and as high as a little over Hz " here https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2758202?page scrollToLastComment true Blip ssp trumpetfish subclass formally proposed Hz Hz Peak frequencies cluster between and Hz and remain between about and Hz here https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Blip ssp varnish run under investigation Hz?

I like the analogy with OS maps and 3D images From my point of view can central frequency and bandwidth along with similarity scores can be disregarded? Sorry I am still confused about peak frequency Is it as I originally thought the frequency of the peak or the frequency of peaks in one second? I have only just realised that individual columns can be sorted I presume only ascending I knew DYCWMI could be sorted I read this in Notes some time ago but stupidly hadn thought to apply it to the normal sim searches It was only in reply to another query that this was mentioned Are there any other tips relating to sim searches? It would be great if the photos of the glitches in the search results were horizontal as in the example rather than vertical Thank you!  Thank you very much for your patient help! The Q transform method based on GWPY seems to have limitations by the way do you know other ways to classify the glitches besides Q transform? When classifying is it usually based on the one dimensional timeseries data or based on the plots based on Q transform? In order Yes that's an example of Omicron having detected additional noise at high frequencies above the Hz top edge of our images in the case of but not in where the central frequency and bandwidth roughly agree with the height of the bliplet but the rectangle is wider than obviously necessary in the latter case the reported duration is seconds enclosing some faint stuff off to the side of the bliplet Probably yes The noisiest frequency the frequency bin where the distribution of noise vs frequency peaks Not the repetition rate of peaks To change from ascending to descending order click a second time on the same column heading The thumbnail pictures were arranged horizontally some years ago until people complained that this took up to much horizontal space and they had to scroll so far sideways to see the numbers Then the arrangement was changed to vertical and we have to scroll a longer way down the page of results Just can't please everyone! On a mobile device like an iPad or using the touchpad on a laptop scrolling horizontally or vertically is equally easy but vertical motions are easier than horizontal ones for people using a mouse with a little scroll wheel so they are better served by the present arrangement  Brilliant! Thank you very much ZngabitanT I must go and try out the sorting ascending and descending!  At the moment while the detection of real gravitational wave signals always relies on the raw timeseries data it has to the Q transform doesn't preserve enough information the classification of individual glitches still relies to a large extent on the Q transform images or even when the observatory operators need a quick overview just on the timestamp peak frequency and SNR without further classification in the form of cluster plots of the bulk distribution E from https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep !

Note that this is a discussion forum associated with the Gravity Spy project on Zooniverse the authors of the gwpy software one of the underlying Python modules used by the Gravity Spy software do not participate here But I'll try to provide an answer based on my limited understanding of the topic The current algorithm which maps glitch noise energy levels to colors works roughly as follows It operates on a one minute long data segment at a time which may contain one or more glitch triggers that will be turned into constant Q transform images showing seconds long pieces of the data The one minute time frequency rectangle is subdivided into many small rectangular tiles and the noise energy in each tile is determined The highest noise energy percentile of any tile in the data segment is used to normalize the energies Then the energy levels from representing the lowest the background level to that highest level are mapped logarithmically to a scale from to and the gradations of this level normalized scale are represented by the hues of the colormap The numbers on the colorbar are simply the steps of on this normalized scale the number marks where on the range from to is So the colors in our images do not represent absolute noise energy levels the normalization will be different from one data segment to the next although it will be the same when multiple Gravity Spy subject images are extracted from one and the same data segment And thanks to this dynamic normalization there is not much truncation and thus not much information lost at high noise energy levels Only the very highest energy percentile of the tiles get painted bright yellow Hope this helps! Please be welcome to ask additional questions on related topics but it is better to start a new discussion thread for a new topic than to take an existing discussion thread and change the topic Thank you for your interest! Yes the 70Hz Blip subclass mackerel can look very chirpish I'm afraid not there's no quick way in Zooniverse to locate the particular page of a collection where a given subject member should appear Maybe some future Zooniverse enhancement could provide such a way but it's not an easy task to implement because the contents of the collection might change in the meantime  Ah I understand thank you but it will take some time to create this this also with 3D rendering engine that works over years ago if you need it I'll separate it into separate thread and reserve my time as image collections  Yes and it was not the only one that night E S was recorded a few minutes later  The Q value is chosen separately for each subject so as to maximize the contrast between the brightest parts and the background For subjects centered on a Blip or Koi Fish this will usually but not always pick on the mostly vertical "body" resulting in a low Q value being chosen For subjects centered on the "outskirts" of a Blip Koi group the choice can depend on subtle details of how the noise is distributed and then we may end up with high Q renderings  Yes corresponding to a lockloss projects zooniverse gravity spy talk on at UTC for no immediately obvious reason The shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions that there had been glitches in both the length and alignment sensing and control loops a tenth of a second earlier  No that is fine thank you Nicm You are doing a brilliant job already!  maybe member of tealight timestamp 21T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page L1O3a 21T Fb UXny 21T pEXPINUZ 21T J WiVUyXn 21T AnsYD70Tgs 21T ufNVldYzVz this 21T amQ ab M 21T NUiavXCeOg 21T BUFxB lVs 21T 5ZmxJqxOJt 21T 9 EBmfN 21T hG9CkV1Y 21T 8QMVKYNglT 21T AKkIUDqBdr 21T rL H mZj 21T tODx NDG 21T 3UGY yE6p 21T XX7Bn T 21T klpOQwMd 21T SjNrGsLTVX 21T IUIEHaibCW 21T boiI T86V 21T iWaM3CEdP 21T 2sOnR1N J 21T UHAnNBIacF 21T suOpchdtE H1O3a 21T wNS8u aKi  I thought as much Is there a way of going through the list of pages any faster I click on then it only seems to go up in small increments How on earth do you manage with scream  When I want to go faster I edit the page part of the URL by hand guesstimating from the subject number I want and from the total number of pages and rough knowledge of the range of subject numbers occurring in the collection on which page I want to be Caveat For a couple of years now the Zooniverse Collections facility has had a bug which had resulted in very large collections more than odd entries being displayed out of order after the first few pages It seems this is getting fixed now but existing large collections are only gradually put back in order  Possible chirp and lower frequency glitches  Oh good grief!

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9FXiwCXCqDlayJvRjPNYoPJ6DnLX4', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='1. **New Glitch Class Proposals in Talk Data Set 2:**\n   In Talk data set 2, there is a discussion about a potential new glitch class referred to as "tadpole" by a citizen scientist, inspired by the visual resemblance of a glitch to a tadpole. This informal proposal arises from the visual categorization of glitches that might not fit cleanly into previously defined classes. The glitch class is not formalized with technical definitions in the dataset, but its mention indicates an evolving attempt to classify visually distinct patterns not covered by existing categories.\n\n2. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes in Talk Data Set 2:**\n   - There are questions about the specificity and accuracy of classifications based on Q transform images, particularly about the impact of color normalization on the visibility and classification of glitches. This indicates a deeper dive into the technical aspects of how glitches are visually represented and how these representations might affect classification accuracy.\n   - Questions regarding alternative methods to the Q transform for classifying glitches show an interest in exploring different computational techniques that might yield more precise or informative representations of glitches.\n   - Queries about how to search for individual subjects in collections more efficiently reveal a practical concern about managing the large datasets typical in citizen science projects like Gravity Spy. This indicates a need for better tools or methods to streamline the process of reviewing and classifying glitches.\n\n3. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Data Set 2:**\n   - There is a hypothesis related to the alignment of glitches and the lockloss events, specifically questioning if certain glitches might be precursors to or results of locklosses. This hypothesis is motivated by observations of glitches occurring near lockloss events, suggesting a possible causal or correlational relationship.\n   - Discussion about the possible environmental or operational causes of glitches, such as equipment malfunctions or external environmental disturbances, shows an ongoing exploration into the practical origins of glitches. This is motivated analytically by trying to correlate glitch occurrences with known events or conditions recorded in the operational logs of gravitational wave observatories.\n\nThese points in Talk data set 2 demonstrate an active and evolving engagement by citizen scientists with both the categorization of glitches and the deeper technical and environmental factors influencing glitch detection in gravitational wave science.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713491582, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_c4e4d95913', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=452, prompt_tokens=22783, total_tokens=23235))

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards Now I need a new plan Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O so there is no hurry for this information just yet Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nicm I like being able to see the two "near time subjects" I guess this one can be classified as fireball koi instead of repeating koi  Correction there doesn't seem to be a koi so only fireballs     bliplet at 40hz plus four other smaller features   fireball koi  Clair de lune?  bliplet at 40hz  fireball koi   19hz braid  crown at Q5? 19hz  candle  Hz not long enough to qualify as Hz line   bliplet at 40hz  483hz line  ZngabitanT Would this one qualify as borderline varnish run blip or should it be a borderline varnish run koi? Crowns at Q22?  coronet  repeating koi   20hz  bliplet at 40hz  koi fireball at Q11 Strange high frequency crown ? Standard crown is at Hz Hi mitchnanny I will include this in my task in the near future and will post it after tomorrow if I can get permission to use metadata from mitchnanny collection and plan to plot timestamps of merge with my own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page in addition to this I'm looking for different Q values in the previous and next subjects with some glitches from ' Fireballish with koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny livingston fireballish with koi ' collections  Hi Nicm of course you may use metadata from my collections The help I need is just in doing a basic spreadsheet in Numbers on the iPad nothing complicated! This is for future collections not existing ones I will carry on with cards until the collections are no longer needed I was just wondering about other column headings if any for the future I don want you to go to a lot of trouble!

Your list of columns looks good for starters I can think of one more thing I'm afraid will also be necessary a way to keep track of "subject X is a duplicate of subject Y" I'll be pleasantly surprised if we don't encounter some amount of duplication among subjects to be uploaded to Gravity Spy in the future And when multiple identical subjects are similar but not identical to a given one there's no guarantee that similarity search will return all of them nor that the lowest numbered subject will be among those returned The full set of duplicates will only be guaranteed to show up when we run a sim search from one of them and ask for sufficiently many results Some other points also for the benefit of future readers Be sure that you have a way to go back to yesterday's version of a spreadsheet when today's has accidentally got mangled or lost Make backups and verify that you can restore from a backup Cloud storage may be suitable here Objectives may expand there's no foretelling what new weird and wonderful glitches are going to show up during O Experiment with a small toy spreadsheet Can you add another column as an afterthought without breaking anything you were able to do with it before adding the column? An additional column won't need to be fully populated immediately for all the subject rows already in the spreadsheet there'll be plenty of further subjects added later and missing information about earlier subjects can be filled in occasionally General criteria for deciding what to include Anything you want to be able to search for g the subject number in case it comes up again anything you want to be able to sort by anything you want to be able to filter on in particular an indication whether the subject is "done" or still in your "to do" queue whether or not you have already fed it back to a similarity search Any column that changes from empty to non empty when you use a subject for a fresh search would suffice or you could use a marker for "to do" items and remove it when "done" and then anything you want to have at your fingertips without having to load the Zooniverse subject page anew or to run the collection through DYCWMI g Q value contributors who had brought up the subject in Talk or previously collected it peak frequency A column identifying the interferometer won't be needed when you plan on keeping separate spreadsheets for each site which has some advantages for all their similarities Hanford and Livingston have never had exactly the same glitch mix I've been mostly interested in bringing subjects into chronological order so for me the date time stamps when the subject was triggered were the first thing I started tracking after the subject numbers Other stuff Q value peak frequency SNR contributors free text annotations got added to my lists over the years as the need arose Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance I've also been keeping track of "zooid does not exist" cases subjects that had never made it into the Gravity Spy tools database You may not have a need for this such subjects can't come up among the results of similarity searches  Neither what I see here is a superposition blend of two probably unrelated glitches Like the Livingston tea light projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches are but this here is not a proper tea light either The peak frequency is reported as Hz so the dominant glitch is the loud triangular borderline between Tomte and Koi thing between about and Hz A Blip subclass varnish run glitch happened a few milliseconds earlier reaching down from the top to about Hz though not bright yellow all the way to the top thus a borderline member of this putative subclass But it's neither quite central nor the dominant feature  Yes we've had some of these occasionally during the third observing run Their first frames can look confusingly similar to those of Hz Line glitches But the latter never come in such wavy arrangements they happened once every minutes while they were happening during a brief period in April only  It's generally not necessary to annotate the obvious Gravity Spy is a bit too large for that with nearly two million active subjects and chance combinations hybrids aren't all that rare What I often do is add them to a suitable one of my collections instead But do feel free to bring up unusual subjects or questionable cases in Talk! Thanks for replying to me I did not notice silent edit If you were going to do small trial run with spreadsheets I was planning on outputting it in specific format along with improving tools myself what I do know is that what I cannot get from DYCWMI is timestamp currently today however once I can get character hash it's not too hard to be surprised might as well choose 'notes' to leave something as other attribute column something versatile It might also be good thing to keep columns that are added at a later date in separate tables and in reference form  Alas that was little too far away timestamp 10T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page L1O3b 10T qZ6QG6AUVf 10T 8EbipPoPhE 10T tLKzn BSz 10T BxQMjU99wP 10T hqzROquOji 10T 9T sj fT 10T I8B aJMm 10T 5g JVsO0v 10T dMaORGSEVF 10T ergyoE1d 10T 6 WfDf 10T sz J4GRTD H1O3b 10T 6lM JuHw 10T 8PXINsEGlW 10T i qIFE2LT 10T ttrO ak 10T Bigh Njd 10T A Q9OoV8s 10T bAP npSe 10T BdLsIWIkrZ 10T mAVlqqEnfK 10T jLevyNasU 10T 82BL7EJCJw 10T oIUwNkUNQW 10T tP42ZbJxwl 10T IhbdRR3Qtb 10T vCywMdcyaw 10T tsVFrDRMLj this 10T TmDzttAK same 10T gvy nGUfx same 10T GjSX5q Zx same 10T KHnuCyUP same 10T kaQueZGQTZ 10T qRiPEgJENO 10T OKfZyvgFwj 10T TWUK87S2w 10T NWF PmXEs 10T hmxyM2CMyh 10T r MvEWIJb 10T 8WezmJCFO 10T HJf hoXS 10T KKFYMRHM 10T FFoOHX7odG 10T IyEYxsfFil 10T Q036soLscL 10T RWzEPzcBpE 10T K MwfS3yx  Thank you very much ZngabitanT All my stuff gets backed up to the cloud every day Knowing me I will probably print out the data regularly Any duplicates I come across at the moment are on the individual sim searches I just write the numbers out and write delete next to all but the lowest number I keep all the sim search printouts making a note of the subject used for each search Should I type all these up in a word type document? With regard to the searches at the moment I have had primary secondary tertiary lists I initially looked at the bliplets collection and chose those subjects that look like raindrop I made a list of these subject and used each one at a time for a sim search All new raindrops I wrote next to the original subject until I had gone through that first list I then compiled a secondary list showing both the initial subject used for the search and the secondary subjects to be used for the next searches And so on ad nauseam! Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Now my brain hurts!  So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date?  There are many ways of doing things and many ways of organizing queues whatever works is fine > Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Yes but it's easier to not add them to a collection in the first place if the collection is intended to be representative of the timeline rather than to mark everything that matches its criteria than it is to find and remove them afterwards > So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date? Only if you're interested in the dates and times down to the minutes! I've been doing it especially for Virgo subjects because the Virgo subject numbers are much more scrambled out of chronological order than the LIGO ones Once as we all hope periodic uploads of recently recorded LIGO subjects resume for ER and O subjects coming from the same day will once again get numbers from a limited range and subjects coming from the next day will get higher numbers so the numbers will already provide an approximation to the date time stamps though they'll still be disordered on timescales of minutes and up to a few hours That'll be good enough for many purposes Glitch classes correlating with very bad windy weather will already stand out for example  An afterthought Also once periodic uploads of fresh subjects resume cascaded similarity searches will be less useful for a while than looking at the fresh subjects classifying as far as possible with the available classes while completely new things might be happening! and keeping an eye on what everyone else will be posting in Talk Sim Search isn't clairvoyant it can't yet see glitches that will happen only tomorrow The cascaded approach is more useful for exploring a realm of already uploaded subjects from past eras  I must admit it would be good to get back to some classifying before I completely forget what is what!  Agriculture and landscaping 46Hz around UTC   52Hz Pirate ship 05  41Hz around UTC Cuneiform  05Hz around UTC   41Hz around UTC Slightly cuneiform?  64Hz I expected a much higher frequency around UTC Artefact around 150Hz ? Pirate ship sailing on scattered light?  This dates from between and UTC it's the first subject from Virgo from that hour for which I've seen an approximate timestamp and in frame I spot artefact bands at least at and Hz plus that gradually fading feature near Hz where there ought to be a perfectly stationary never supposed to become visible as a transient spectral line associated with regulating the frequency wavelength of Virgo's main laser I'll bet there's something willow like just over the 2s edge a glitch originating in the laser amplifier and with overtone rich features with msec periodicity just what willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are but it must be either a very peculiar one that hasn't ever come up in a similarity search anchored on another of six hundred odd willows or else it's one that's missing from the Gravity Spy tools database Good catch in any case!  It nice to be back finding things like this again  Hi mitchnanny Regarding ZngabitanT's comment above > Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance While I cannot provide the specific instructions for an iPad as I do not use one here is an outline on how I work with spreadsheet software on a Windows laptop to manage sim searches and collections under study I first sort the sim search results original page by SNR either ascending or descending Then I download the Excel option of the search results as an xlsx file I rename the file with interferometer name era run and seed subject number Then I follow these general steps This is just an overview to give an idea on how I work without describing in detail all actions as you want to keep it simple Using a spreadsheet software I upload the downloaded xlsx file into a new spreadsheet I rename the spreadsheet with interferometer name era run glitch name under study and other information to find it back quickly The uploaded file appears in a new tab a sheet within the spreadsheet automatically formatted with all the columns from the sim search page I rename this tab with the seed subject number I mark the seed subject in the sheet Looking for multiple copies I look at the SNR column where the numbers appear already sorted I paint red those cells along subject number and keep them for future reference I keep the lowest multiple subject number for consistency and paint the cell blue for future reference Now I copy paste one by one the representative subject numbers find their corresponding GS page and see if they fit my collection In this way I can grow representative collections as the multiplicity issue has already been dealt with in the spreadsheet Still a double check is always essential before posting a collection to ensure that there are no multiple copies overlooked somewhere In this way the collection histogram will give a clean representation on glitch density I add an extra column to my sheets where I annotate whether a subject already exists in my collection or was newly added Hence I can pick better new seeds Here is where I discover borderline and possibly new glitches or those intrusively appearing in searches for instance H O Whistle on Blip ssp Trumpetfish For each sim search I also add to the sheet the corresponding histogram as an image insert Then I feed representative subject numbers from my sheet into loops of sim searches For each new search result I proceed as in the steps above download file with SNR already sorted create new sheet tab and name it accordingly look for multiple subject copies retrieve subject page grow collections pick aliens add histogram notes jot down questions and so on Repeat for each sim search performed In the end I ll have a whole spreadsheet file on a given interferometer and particular era or run for a given glitch study containing all the sim searches grouped under seed numbers tabs multiple subjects excluded lowest numbers picked all the subjects that I added to specific collections those discarded borderline and alien ones seeds fed to the ensuing sim searches all the histograms and several notes I create a new spreadsheet file for a new interferometer or a new era run that I want to perform sim searches upon by using the first sim search run then proceed as above So I have one file for each interferometer on a particular era run and also for the other interferometers accordingly I also used the spreadsheets for the Blip ssp Trumpetfish training sets and anything in between that needed to be looked upon A spreadsheet software may offer Insights charts like those I posted in my threads on the Trumpetfish investigation which give additional views and understanding on the data One thing that I found useful during the lengthy glitch investigation is that a spreadsheet gives a compact view of the sim search results without all the scrolling forth and back on the original page Also as I was doing moderate to large sim searches I could manage more than results when needed other times I had to test certain issues with the recommended maximum number of results It also allows for a detailed study of the other parameters while it is easy to sort filter and find values across sheets The spreadsheets helped me to keep a digital and retrievable history of the sim searches and findings seeds multiple subject numbers and lowest numbers picked the evolution of histograms notes and discoveries along the way I continue to use this method in my current investigations of several Blip potential subclasses So all this is just a glimpse on how I juggle sim searches and growing collections in a manageable and trackable way You can add to your sheets any column attribute you might find useful and over time you will feel what works best for you Spreadsheets have myriad functions and actions but you can keep

Also I was able to download the excel file I normally just view then print to work on the search results and save it to Numbers It a start I have a long way to go but I am extremely grateful for what I have just learned from you It all a huge learning curve for me Thank you  Good morning mitchnanny glad to hear so I know you will be able to take what you need from my explanation and start your learning curve Take a look at the Apple tutorial I referenced above their guides use screenshots and it seems well explained While office management software has evolved much in the past decades they still keep the basic functions Regards You mean the image for the second frame was incomplete when it got shown to you? That could happen fortunately very rarely when the image file transmission from the Zooniverse cloud servers to your browser got stuck or got disrupted for some reason The file itself is OK showing a normal image to me now  This is Scattered Light la Virgo O Only the tops of the arches are bright enough to show up well and here the high Q processing has further stretched them horizontally and further subdued the flanks But the overall arrangement is characteristic  I'm not quite sure what it is either It could be a high Q rendering of an HFB or somewhat less likely an isolated brighter spot in a very faint whistle Calling it NOTA when neither option looks convincing is a safe alternative  There is a proposed glitch class for this whistle variant Gnarly Whistle projects zooniverse gravity spy talk so they can also be classified as None Of The Above while the proposal is pending For once the nickname had been given by the LIGO engineers themselves not by our volunteer community  Wonderful mitchnanny I am so happy that I could be of help and yours is a great starting point Allow me to suggest a learning approach You may resume re learning spreadsheets by creating yourself a simple file with just two or three columns in a tab filled with some words and numbers Then practise adding removing sorting searching renaming painting all the basic actions Then add another tab fill it in and try searching the whole spreadsheet for a number or word Then continue with very small sim searches results downloaded so that you feel in control of the sheet while mastering already the basic functions One step at a time my friend! The subsequent extremely loud noise associated with the lockloss in S has produced extensive data processing artefacts across the whole minute long data segment from which the spectrograms for these three Hanford subjects were produced The blips in S and in the present S are taller than they look they are half hidden behind the dark artefact bands This is best visible when looking at the fourth frames using the "half moon" button to toggle between normal and inverted colours also helps The relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions the lockloss but provides no further details about what caused it  Thank you Coralbell I will definitely have a few practise spreadsheets I will have to sort out some sort of filing system It is a bit fiddly on the iPad You mention adding the bar graph with the sim searches Does that have to be done via Imgur? I hope the answer is no !  Gladfully no haha! There must be an "Insert image" or similar function on your iPad spreadsheet Simply save the histogram image from GS to your device and then use the spreadsheet function to add it on your sheet  I downloaded the dataset from here BUT I doubt there are some instances in the "Extremely Loud" class that are misclassified ! Example https imgloc com lKYT Is that true? How can we correct those instances? ! Example Alt Text https xyz lKYT png  Thank goodness for that!

I have managed to save a sim search to Numbers plus bar chart but forgot to create a collection I thought I could go back with the back arrow but the collection had different subject numbers I have huge problems creating folders in the right place and I don want hundreds of individual sim searches floating around Just as I think I have created a folder and saved something into it I can find it again Stuff can be saved to the iPad or the cloud but ultimately it all gets backed up to the cloud I have had desktop computers in the past but prefer the iPad for most of my uses I intend to replace it some time and may get an external keyboard If all else fails it back to the cards!!! One more attempt at this wretched bliplets sim search then that it! Definitely a G T evening coming up! Hi Nicm in the VERY dim and distant past when I was working with medical records it was a Linux system so I have at least heard of it!

What happened there is that the immense amount of noise just past the right edge upset the preprocessing whitening algorithm acting on the minute long data segment from which the seconds wide spectrograms were extracted The strain channel was already extremely noisy at time seconds but it then got a whole lot noisier over the next few seconds by several orders of magnitude and the algorithms used at the time reacted by producing very small numbers and very dark spectrogram colors for the seconds window we get to see This was pointed out a while later apropos of a similar subject from the second observing run the first use of the zerosignal hashtag in Gravity Spy Talk one of the comments there provides some further explanation projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 466268?comment Training the Machine Learning to recognize such nearly zero signal spectrograms as originating from events that truly are extremely loud it can't get any worse than the interferometer losing the lock! had been useful at the time even though it looks confusing at first glance to our human eyes Hope this sheds some light on the matter!

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes! It involves a lot of tapping provided you have the correct bit highlighted Thank you Coralbell I have printed out the instructions I couldn find anything about it yesterday At least I know it can be done in Numbers I actually have all my sim searches for my main two collections kept as printouts in folders As I go on I get more organised with them so if necessary I can go back to them I cross reference from my index cards It only in the last few months I have been cascading or I imagine I have looking for raindrop and fly bliplets so have dozens of printouts  True Also the present subject is the only one from the group above that was rendered at  Oops I did forget sigh don't know what I was thinking about Thank you so much for reminding me and also for proposing the "blip subclass blip" Without your reference subjects and description I would have only added to the collection subjects that were taller than Hz  Blip and small fireball  fireball koi   sprites  repeating koi   bliplet at 40hz Glad to hear that you could find it and keeping the instructions handy is always a good idea Both links I sent you along this conversation refer to Numbers User Guide for iPad https support apple com guide numbers ipad welcome ipados There is a Table of Contents covering different help topics which could serve as a useful reference in the future I am sorry that I do not own an iPad to give you specific answers for that device but I am happy to share any knowledge I might have to help you sort things out  You have been amazingly helpful Coralbell All this must have taken you away from your own important work Thank you  Sorry about the confusion ZngabitanT and glad that you referenced my paragraph where I mention Droplet so that the differences are sorted out and now we welcome Mackerel to the Blip family! I am currently drafting my LIGO Blip Subclass Droplet findings and hopefully shall post it soon moving home and country has been challenging As we have now several Blip subspecies on the map who live nearby each other or in the same waters I made a list of the subspecies being looked into so far and added the peak frequency band as expressed in their own threads Some subspecies are still in their beginnings so their characteristics are yet to be defined but I think that it is good to have a clear idea altogether on where each one lies around so that we can better keep characterizing them I made the list below kindly reply with your input corrections or additions thank you in advance ZngabitanT and mitchnanny Note The xxs mean that I could not find a value mentioned or that it does not exist yet Quoting below ZngabitanT from different threads Blip ssp blip subclass formally proposed Hz Hz " can go as low as a little under Hz and as high as a little over Hz " here https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2758202?page scrollToLastComment true Blip ssp trumpetfish subclass formally proposed Hz Hz Peak frequencies cluster between and Hz and remain between about and Hz here https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Blip ssp varnish run under investigation Hz?

I like the analogy with OS maps and 3D images From my point of view can central frequency and bandwidth along with similarity scores can be disregarded? Sorry I am still confused about peak frequency Is it as I originally thought the frequency of the peak or the frequency of peaks in one second? I have only just realised that individual columns can be sorted I presume only ascending I knew DYCWMI could be sorted I read this in Notes some time ago but stupidly hadn thought to apply it to the normal sim searches It was only in reply to another query that this was mentioned Are there any other tips relating to sim searches? It would be great if the photos of the glitches in the search results were horizontal as in the example rather than vertical Thank you!  Thank you very much for your patient help! The Q transform method based on GWPY seems to have limitations by the way do you know other ways to classify the glitches besides Q transform? When classifying is it usually based on the one dimensional timeseries data or based on the plots based on Q transform? In order Yes that's an example of Omicron having detected additional noise at high frequencies above the Hz top edge of our images in the case of but not in where the central frequency and bandwidth roughly agree with the height of the bliplet but the rectangle is wider than obviously necessary in the latter case the reported duration is seconds enclosing some faint stuff off to the side of the bliplet Probably yes The noisiest frequency the frequency bin where the distribution of noise vs frequency peaks Not the repetition rate of peaks To change from ascending to descending order click a second time on the same column heading The thumbnail pictures were arranged horizontally some years ago until people complained that this took up to much horizontal space and they had to scroll so far sideways to see the numbers Then the arrangement was changed to vertical and we have to scroll a longer way down the page of results Just can't please everyone! On a mobile device like an iPad or using the touchpad on a laptop scrolling horizontally or vertically is equally easy but vertical motions are easier than horizontal ones for people using a mouse with a little scroll wheel so they are better served by the present arrangement  Brilliant! Thank you very much ZngabitanT I must go and try out the sorting ascending and descending!  At the moment while the detection of real gravitational wave signals always relies on the raw timeseries data it has to the Q transform doesn't preserve enough information the classification of individual glitches still relies to a large extent on the Q transform images or even when the observatory operators need a quick overview just on the timestamp peak frequency and SNR without further classification in the form of cluster plots of the bulk distribution E from https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep !

Note that this is a discussion forum associated with the Gravity Spy project on Zooniverse the authors of the gwpy software one of the underlying Python modules used by the Gravity Spy software do not participate here But I'll try to provide an answer based on my limited understanding of the topic The current algorithm which maps glitch noise energy levels to colors works roughly as follows It operates on a one minute long data segment at a time which may contain one or more glitch triggers that will be turned into constant Q transform images showing seconds long pieces of the data The one minute time frequency rectangle is subdivided into many small rectangular tiles and the noise energy in each tile is determined The highest noise energy percentile of any tile in the data segment is used to normalize the energies Then the energy levels from representing the lowest the background level to that highest level are mapped logarithmically to a scale from to and the gradations of this level normalized scale are represented by the hues of the colormap The numbers on the colorbar are simply the steps of on this normalized scale the number marks where on the range from to is So the colors in our images do not represent absolute noise energy levels the normalization will be different from one data segment to the next although it will be the same when multiple Gravity Spy subject images are extracted from one and the same data segment And thanks to this dynamic normalization there is not much truncation and thus not much information lost at high noise energy levels Only the very highest energy percentile of the tiles get painted bright yellow Hope this helps! Please be welcome to ask additional questions on related topics but it is better to start a new discussion thread for a new topic than to take an existing discussion thread and change the topic Thank you for your interest! Yes the 70Hz Blip subclass mackerel can look very chirpish I'm afraid not there's no quick way in Zooniverse to locate the particular page of a collection where a given subject member should appear Maybe some future Zooniverse enhancement could provide such a way but it's not an easy task to implement because the contents of the collection might change in the meantime  Ah I understand thank you but it will take some time to create this this also with 3D rendering engine that works over years ago if you need it I'll separate it into separate thread and reserve my time as image collections  Yes and it was not the only one that night E S was recorded a few minutes later  The Q value is chosen separately for each subject so as to maximize the contrast between the brightest parts and the background For subjects centered on a Blip or Koi Fish this will usually but not always pick on the mostly vertical "body" resulting in a low Q value being chosen For subjects centered on the "outskirts" of a Blip Koi group the choice can depend on subtle details of how the noise is distributed and then we may end up with high Q renderings  Yes corresponding to a lockloss projects zooniverse gravity spy talk on at UTC for no immediately obvious reason The shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions that there had been glitches in both the length and alignment sensing and control loops a tenth of a second earlier  No that is fine thank you Nicm You are doing a brilliant job already!  maybe member of tealight timestamp 21T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page L1O3a 21T Fb UXny 21T pEXPINUZ 21T J WiVUyXn 21T AnsYD70Tgs 21T ufNVldYzVz this 21T amQ ab M 21T NUiavXCeOg 21T BUFxB lVs 21T 5ZmxJqxOJt 21T 9 EBmfN 21T hG9CkV1Y 21T 8QMVKYNglT 21T AKkIUDqBdr 21T rL H mZj 21T tODx NDG 21T 3UGY yE6p 21T XX7Bn T 21T klpOQwMd 21T SjNrGsLTVX 21T IUIEHaibCW 21T boiI T86V 21T iWaM3CEdP 21T 2sOnR1N J 21T UHAnNBIacF 21T suOpchdtE H1O3a 21T wNS8u aKi  I thought as much Is there a way of going through the list of pages any faster I click on then it only seems to go up in small increments How on earth do you manage with scream  When I want to go faster I edit the page part of the URL by hand guesstimating from the subject number I want and from the total number of pages and rough knowledge of the range of subject numbers occurring in the collection on which page I want to be Caveat For a couple of years now the Zooniverse Collections facility has had a bug which had resulted in very large collections more than odd entries being displayed out of order after the first few pages It seems this is getting fixed now but existing large collections are only gradually put back in order  Possible chirp and lower frequency glitches  Oh good grief!

    - 1400 Ripple 
    - 70 Hz Line 
    - Air Compressor (50 Hz)
    - Blip

    - Low-Frequency Line 
    - No Glitch

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

This indicates a pattern or visual representation that stands out distinctly from other known classes such as Koi Fish or Blip, warranting a separate classification.\n   \n2. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - **Question on Sim Search and Frequency Parameters:**\n     - A significant query arose about how similarity in glitches is determined, particularly questioning the role of central frequency, bandwidth, and similarity scores when glitches appear visually similar yet have differing parameters. The reasoning behind this question likely stems from a desire to understand how these parameters influence glitch classification and if they could potentially overlook or misclassify similar glitches due to parameter variation.\n   - **Question on Classification Techniques Beyond Q Transform:**\n     - Another emerging question was about alternative methods for glitch classification beyond the Q transform technique. This reflects a deeper interest in exploring different analytical approaches to classify glitches more accurately or perhaps to capture features that Q transform might miss.\n\n3. **Hypotheses Regarding Origins of Glitches:**\n   - **Environmental Factors and Sensor Errors:**\n     - The discussions in Talk data set 2 allude to the importance of environmental factors and sensor errors in glitch occurrences. One hypothesis suggested involves the correlation of glitches with specific external conditions like ambient magnetic fields or seismic activities, which could influence the sensors. The analytical motivation here is to identify and mitigate such external influences to improve the reliability of gravitational wave observations and reduce false positives in glitch detection.\n\nIn summary, Talk data set 2 reveals an advanced engagement by citizen scientists, not just in identifying and categorizing glitches but also in probing deeper into the technical and environmental aspects influencing these glitches. The evolution from simple identification in Talk data set 1 to proposing new classifications and exploring underlying causes in Talk data set 2 indicates a maturing interest and increasing sophistication in the citizen scientists' approach to gravitational wave data analysis.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713551220, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_76f018034d', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=434, prompt_tokens=22783, total_tokens=23217))

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards Now I need a new plan Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O so there is no hurry for this information just yet Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic !

Standard crown is at Hz Hi mitchnanny I will include this in my task in the near future and will post it after tomorrow if I can get permission to use metadata from mitchnanny collection and plan to plot timestamps of merge with my own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page in addition to this I'm looking for different Q values in the previous and next subjects with some glitches from ' Fireballish with koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny livingston fireballish with koi ' collections  Hi Nicm of course you may use metadata from my collections The help I need is just in doing a basic spreadsheet in Numbers on the iPad nothing complicated! This is for future collections not existing ones I will carry on with cards until the collections are no longer needed I was just wondering about other column headings if any for the future I don want you to go to a lot of trouble!

Your list of columns looks good for starters I can think of one more thing I'm afraid will also be necessary a way to keep track of "subject X is a duplicate of subject Y" I'll be pleasantly surprised if we don't encounter some amount of duplication among subjects to be uploaded to Gravity Spy in the future And when multiple identical subjects are similar but not identical to a given one there's no guarantee that similarity search will return all of them nor that the lowest numbered subject will be among those returned The full set of duplicates will only be guaranteed to show up when we run a sim search from one of them and ask for sufficiently many results Some other points also for the benefit of future readers Be sure that you have a way to go back to yesterday's version of a spreadsheet when today's has accidentally got mangled or lost Make backups and verify that you can restore from a backup Cloud storage may be suitable here Objectives may expand there's no foretelling what new weird and wonderful glitches are going to show up during O Experiment with a small toy spreadsheet Can you add another column as an afterthought without breaking anything you were able to do with it before adding the column? An additional column won't need to be fully populated immediately for all the subject rows already in the spreadsheet there'll be plenty of further subjects added later and missing information about earlier subjects can be filled in occasionally General criteria for deciding what to include Anything you want to be able to search for g the subject number in case it comes up again anything you want to be able to sort by anything you want to be able to filter on in particular an indication whether the subject is "done" or still in your "to do" queue whether or not you have already fed it back to a similarity search Any column that changes from empty to non empty when you use a subject for a fresh search would suffice or you could use a marker for "to do" items and remove it when "done" and then anything you want to have at your fingertips without having to load the Zooniverse subject page anew or to run the collection through DYCWMI g Q value contributors who had brought up the subject in Talk or previously collected it peak frequency A column identifying the interferometer won't be needed when you plan on keeping separate spreadsheets for each site which has some advantages for all their similarities Hanford and Livingston have never had exactly the same glitch mix I've been mostly interested in bringing subjects into chronological order so for me the date time stamps when the subject was triggered were the first thing I started tracking after the subject numbers Other stuff Q value peak frequency SNR contributors free text annotations got added to my lists over the years as the need arose Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance I've also been keeping track of "zooid does not exist" cases subjects that had never made it into the Gravity Spy tools database You may not have a need for this such subjects can't come up among the results of similarity searches  Neither what I see here is a superposition blend of two probably unrelated glitches Like the Livingston tea light projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches are but this here is not a proper tea light either The peak frequency is reported as Hz so the dominant glitch is the loud triangular borderline between Tomte and Koi thing between about and Hz A Blip subclass varnish run glitch happened a few milliseconds earlier reaching down from the top to about Hz though not bright yellow all the way to the top thus a borderline member of this putative subclass But it's neither quite central nor the dominant feature  Yes we've had some of these occasionally during the third observing run Their first frames can look confusingly similar to those of Hz Line glitches But the latter never come in such wavy arrangements they happened once every minutes while they were happening during a brief period in April only  It's generally not necessary to annotate the obvious Gravity Spy is a bit too large for that with nearly two million active subjects and chance combinations hybrids aren't all that rare What I often do is add them to a suitable one of my collections instead But do feel free to bring up unusual subjects or questionable cases in Talk! Thanks for replying to me I did not notice silent edit If you were going to do small trial run with spreadsheets I was planning on outputting it in specific format along with improving tools myself what I do know is that what I cannot get from DYCWMI is timestamp currently today however once I can get character hash it's not too hard to be surprised might as well choose 'notes' to leave something as other attribute column something versatile It might also be good thing to keep columns that are added at a later date in separate tables and in reference form  Alas that was little too far away timestamp 10T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page L1O3b 10T qZ6QG6AUVf 10T 8EbipPoPhE 10T tLKzn BSz 10T BxQMjU99wP 10T hqzROquOji 10T 9T sj fT 10T I8B aJMm 10T 5g JVsO0v 10T dMaORGSEVF 10T ergyoE1d 10T 6 WfDf 10T sz J4GRTD H1O3b 10T 6lM JuHw 10T 8PXINsEGlW 10T i qIFE2LT 10T ttrO ak 10T Bigh Njd 10T A Q9OoV8s 10T bAP npSe 10T BdLsIWIkrZ 10T mAVlqqEnfK 10T jLevyNasU 10T 82BL7EJCJw 10T oIUwNkUNQW 10T tP42ZbJxwl 10T IhbdRR3Qtb 10T vCywMdcyaw 10T tsVFrDRMLj this 10T TmDzttAK same 10T gvy nGUfx same 10T GjSX5q Zx same 10T KHnuCyUP same 10T kaQueZGQTZ 10T qRiPEgJENO 10T OKfZyvgFwj 10T TWUK87S2w 10T NWF PmXEs 10T hmxyM2CMyh 10T r MvEWIJb 10T 8WezmJCFO 10T HJf hoXS 10T KKFYMRHM 10T FFoOHX7odG 10T IyEYxsfFil 10T Q036soLscL 10T RWzEPzcBpE 10T K MwfS3yx  Thank you very much ZngabitanT All my stuff gets backed up to the cloud every day Knowing me I will probably print out the data regularly Any duplicates I come across at the moment are on the individual sim searches I just write the numbers out and write delete next to all but the lowest number I keep all the sim search printouts making a note of the subject used for each search Should I type all these up in a word type document? With regard to the searches at the moment I have had primary secondary tertiary lists I initially looked at the bliplets collection and chose those subjects that look like raindrop I made a list of these subject and used each one at a time for a sim search All new raindrops I wrote next to the original subject until I had gone through that first list I then compiled a secondary list showing both the initial subject used for the search and the secondary subjects to be used for the next searches And so on ad nauseam! Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Now my brain hurts!  So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date?  There are many ways of doing things and many ways of organizing queues whatever works is fine > Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Yes but it's easier to not add them to a collection in the first place if the collection is intended to be representative of the timeline rather than to mark everything that matches its criteria than it is to find and remove them afterwards > So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date? Only if you're interested in the dates and times down to the minutes! I've been doing it especially for Virgo subjects because the Virgo subject numbers are much more scrambled out of chronological order than the LIGO ones Once as we all hope periodic uploads of recently recorded LIGO subjects resume for ER and O subjects coming from the same day will once again get numbers from a limited range and subjects coming from the next day will get higher numbers so the numbers will already provide an approximation to the date time stamps though they'll still be disordered on timescales of minutes and up to a few hours That'll be good enough for many purposes Glitch classes correlating with very bad windy weather will already stand out for example  An afterthought Also once periodic uploads of fresh subjects resume cascaded similarity searches will be less useful for a while than looking at the fresh subjects classifying as far as possible with the available classes while completely new things might be happening! and keeping an eye on what everyone else will be posting in Talk Sim Search isn't clairvoyant it can't yet see glitches that will happen only tomorrow The cascaded approach is more useful for exploring a realm of already uploaded subjects from past eras  I must admit it would be good to get back to some classifying before I completely forget what is what!  Agriculture and landscaping 46Hz around UTC   52Hz Pirate ship 05  41Hz around UTC Cuneiform  05Hz around UTC   41Hz around UTC Slightly cuneiform?  64Hz I expected a much higher frequency around UTC Artefact around 150Hz ? Pirate ship sailing on scattered light?  This dates from between and UTC it's the first subject from Virgo from that hour for which I've seen an approximate timestamp and in frame I spot artefact bands at least at and Hz plus that gradually fading feature near Hz where there ought to be a perfectly stationary never supposed to become visible as a transient spectral line associated with regulating the frequency wavelength of Virgo's main laser I'll bet there's something willow like just over the 2s edge a glitch originating in the laser amplifier and with overtone rich features with msec periodicity just what willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are but it must be either a very peculiar one that hasn't ever come up in a similarity search anchored on another of six hundred odd willows or else it's one that's missing from the Gravity Spy tools database Good catch in any case!  It nice to be back finding things like this again  Hi mitchnanny Regarding ZngabitanT's comment above > Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance While I cannot provide the specific instructions for an iPad as I do not use one here is an outline on how I work with spreadsheet software on a Windows laptop to manage sim searches and collections under study I first sort the sim search results original page by SNR either ascending or descending Then I download the Excel option of the search results as an xlsx file I rename the file with interferometer name era run and seed subject number Then I follow these general steps This is just an overview to give an idea on how I work without describing in detail all actions as you want to keep it simple Using a spreadsheet software I upload the downloaded xlsx file into a new spreadsheet I rename the spreadsheet with interferometer name era run glitch name under study and other information to find it back quickly The uploaded file appears in a new tab a sheet within the spreadsheet automatically formatted with all the columns from the sim search page I rename this tab with the seed subject number I mark the seed subject in the sheet Looking for multiple copies I look at the SNR column where the numbers appear already sorted I paint red those cells along subject number and keep them for future reference I keep the lowest multiple subject number for consistency and paint the cell blue for future reference Now I copy paste one by one the representative subject numbers find their corresponding GS page and see if they fit my collection In this way I can grow representative collections as the multiplicity issue has already been dealt with in the spreadsheet Still a double check is always essential before posting a collection to ensure that there are no multiple copies overlooked somewhere In this way the collection histogram will give a clean representation on glitch density I add an extra column to my sheets where I annotate whether a subject already exists in my collection or was newly added Hence I can pick better new seeds Here is where I discover borderline and possibly new glitches or those intrusively appearing in searches for instance H O Whistle on Blip ssp Trumpetfish For each sim search I also add to the sheet the corresponding histogram as an image insert Then I feed representative subject numbers from my sheet into loops of sim searches For each new search result I proceed as in the steps above download file with SNR already sorted create new sheet tab and name it accordingly look for multiple subject copies retrieve subject page grow collections pick aliens add histogram notes jot down questions and so on Repeat for each sim search performed In the end I ll have a whole spreadsheet file on a given interferometer and particular era or run for a given glitch study containing all the sim searches grouped under seed numbers tabs multiple subjects excluded lowest numbers picked all the subjects that I added to specific collections those discarded borderline and alien ones seeds fed to the ensuing sim searches all the histograms and several notes I create a new spreadsheet file for a new interferometer or a new era run that I want to perform sim searches upon by using the first sim search run then proceed as above So I have one file for each interferometer on a particular era run and also for the other interferometers accordingly I also used the spreadsheets for the Blip ssp Trumpetfish training sets and anything in between that needed to be looked upon A spreadsheet software may offer Insights charts like those I posted in my threads on the Trumpetfish investigation which give additional views and understanding on the data One thing that I found useful during the lengthy glitch investigation is that a spreadsheet gives a compact view of the sim search results without all the scrolling forth and back on the original page Also as I was doing moderate to large sim searches I could manage more than results when needed other times I had to test certain issues with the recommended maximum number of results It also allows for a detailed study of the other parameters while it is easy to sort filter and find values across sheets The spreadsheets helped me to keep a digital and retrievable history of the sim searches and findings seeds multiple subject numbers and lowest numbers picked the evolution of histograms notes and discoveries along the way I continue to use this method in my current investigations of several Blip potential subclasses So all this is just a glimpse on how I juggle sim searches and growing collections in a manageable and trackable way You can add to your sheets any column attribute you might find useful and over time you will feel what works best for you Spreadsheets have myriad functions and actions but you can keep it as simple as necessary to suit your needs Hope it helps it actually goes swiftly with practice There is this Apple tutorial Create a spreadsheet in Numbers on iPad https support apple com guide

Also I was able to download the excel file I normally just view then print to work on the search results and save it to Numbers It a start I have a long way to go but I am extremely grateful for what I have just learned from you It all a huge learning curve for me Thank you  Good morning mitchnanny glad to hear so I know you will be able to take what you need from my explanation and start your learning curve Take a look at the Apple tutorial I referenced above their guides use screenshots and it seems well explained While office management software has evolved much in the past decades they still keep the basic functions Regards You mean the image for the second frame was incomplete when it got shown to you? That could happen fortunately very rarely when the image file transmission from the Zooniverse cloud servers to your browser got stuck or got disrupted for some reason The file itself is OK showing a normal image to me now  This is Scattered Light la Virgo O Only the tops of the arches are bright enough to show up well and here the high Q processing has further stretched them horizontally and further subdued the flanks But the overall arrangement is characteristic  I'm not quite sure what it is either It could be a high Q rendering of an HFB or somewhat less likely an isolated brighter spot in a very faint whistle Calling it NOTA when neither option looks convincing is a safe alternative  There is a proposed glitch class for this whistle variant Gnarly Whistle projects zooniverse gravity spy talk so they can also be classified as None Of The Above while the proposal is pending For once the nickname had been given by the LIGO engineers themselves not by our volunteer community  Wonderful mitchnanny I am so happy that I could be of help and yours is a great starting point Allow me to suggest a learning approach You may resume re learning spreadsheets by creating yourself a simple file with just two or three columns in a tab filled with some words and numbers Then practise adding removing sorting searching renaming painting all the basic actions Then add another tab fill it in and try searching the whole spreadsheet for a number or word Then continue with very small sim searches results downloaded so that you feel in control of the sheet while mastering already the basic functions One step at a time my friend! The subsequent extremely loud noise associated with the lockloss in S has produced extensive data processing artefacts across the whole minute long data segment from which the spectrograms for these three Hanford subjects were produced The blips in S and in the present S are taller than they look they are half hidden behind the dark artefact bands This is best visible when looking at the fourth frames using the "half moon" button to toggle between normal and inverted colours also helps The relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions the lockloss but provides no further details about what caused it  Thank you Coralbell I will definitely have a few practise spreadsheets I will have to sort out some sort of filing system It is a bit fiddly on the iPad You mention adding the bar graph with the sim searches Does that have to be done via Imgur? I hope the answer is no !  Gladfully no haha! There must be an "Insert image" or similar function on your iPad spreadsheet Simply save the histogram image from GS to your device and then use the spreadsheet function to add it on your sheet  I downloaded the dataset from here BUT I doubt there are some instances in the "Extremely Loud" class that are misclassified ! Example https imgloc com lKYT Is that true? How can we correct those instances? ! Example Alt Text https xyz lKYT png  Thank goodness for that!

I have managed to save a sim search to Numbers plus bar chart but forgot to create a collection I thought I could go back with the back arrow but the collection had different subject numbers I have huge problems creating folders in the right place and I don want hundreds of individual sim searches floating around Just as I think I have created a folder and saved something into it I can find it again Stuff can be saved to the iPad or the cloud but ultimately it all gets backed up to the cloud I have had desktop computers in the past but prefer the iPad for most of my uses I intend to replace it some time and may get an external keyboard If all else fails it back to the cards!!! One more attempt at this wretched bliplets sim search then that it! Definitely a G T evening coming up! Hi Nicm in the VERY dim and distant past when I was working with medical records it was a Linux system so I have at least heard of it! I didn do anything with the system itself can you imagine the chaos!

What happened there is that the immense amount of noise just past the right edge upset the preprocessing whitening algorithm acting on the minute long data segment from which the seconds wide spectrograms were extracted The strain channel was already extremely noisy at time seconds but it then got a whole lot noisier over the next few seconds by several orders of magnitude and the algorithms used at the time reacted by producing very small numbers and very dark spectrogram colors for the seconds window we get to see This was pointed out a while later apropos of a similar subject from the second observing run the first use of the zerosignal hashtag in Gravity Spy Talk one of the comments there provides some further explanation projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 466268?comment Training the Machine Learning to recognize such nearly zero signal spectrograms as originating from events that truly are extremely loud it can't get any worse than the interferometer losing the lock! had been useful at the time even though it looks confusing at first glance to our human eyes Hope this sheds some light on the matter!  O Must resist temptation to mention punched cards on the TR  No access to one that I would be able to use for this That the beauty of the iPad it is always beside me ready for whatever comes next so I really want to make it work for this but it isn easy Mind you I won be doing cascading sim searches for some time yet so I will go back to my old much quicker ways with my bliplets I have learned a lot today and spent hours doing this At least I know I can download an excel file from a sim search to Numbers and add the graph I just mustn forget to create a zoo collection as well Enough!!! Thank you dear mitchnanny I am confident you will find yor way and am so glad again to hear that you learnt this much today  Hmmm it was too difficult to scour usual major giant corporate software instruction manuals and imagine what I needed todo to figure out steps to get necessary files and data together Best help possible for me was to create Linux like batch file assuming I wanted to process some data in shell scripts I was just a kid then as can be imagined in the days before release of Windows we picked it up from junk and built various ecosystems to use up last of computer's life and here we are today What now replaced spreadsheet was direct use of Relational DataBase engine a GNU software suite of traditional SQL language with no additional licensing required for older software manual sheets are still paper based no need to download huge PDFs using a paid internet connection and operating procedures have not changed from then to now This is biggest advantage we can continue to have all users process something in exactly the same way I'm envisioned discussing various glitched data using exactly same results in those ways!

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes! It involves a lot of tapping provided you have the correct bit highlighted Thank you Coralbell I have printed out the instructions I couldn find anything about it yesterday At least I know it can be done in Numbers I actually have all my sim searches for my main two collections kept as printouts in folders As I go on I get more organised with them so if necessary I can go back to them I cross reference from my index cards It only in the last few months I have been cascading or I imagine I have looking for raindrop and fly bliplets so have dozens of printouts  True Also the present subject is the only one from the group above that was rendered at  Oops I did forget sigh don't know what I was thinking about Thank you so much for reminding me and also for proposing the "blip subclass blip" Without your reference subjects and description I would have only added to the collection subjects that were taller than Hz  Blip and small fireball  fireball koi   sprites  repeating koi   bliplet at 40hz Glad to hear that you could find it and keeping the instructions handy is always a good idea Both links I sent you along this conversation refer to Numbers User Guide for iPad https support apple com guide numbers ipad welcome ipados There is a Table of Contents covering different help topics which could serve as a useful reference in the future I am sorry that I do not own an iPad to give you specific answers for that device but I am happy to share any knowledge I might have to help you sort things out  You have been amazingly helpful Coralbell All this must have taken you away from your own important work Thank you  Sorry about the confusion ZngabitanT and glad that you referenced my paragraph where I mention Droplet so that the differences are sorted out and now we welcome Mackerel to the Blip family! I am currently drafting my LIGO Blip Subclass Droplet findings and hopefully shall post it soon moving home and country has been challenging As we have now several Blip subspecies on the map who live nearby each other or in the same waters I made a list of the subspecies being looked into so far and added the peak frequency band as expressed in their own threads Some subspecies are still in their beginnings so their characteristics are yet to be defined but I think that it is good to have a clear idea altogether on where each one lies around so that we can better keep characterizing them I made the list below kindly reply with your input corrections or additions thank you in advance ZngabitanT and mitchnanny Note The xxs mean that I could not find a value mentioned or that it does not exist yet Quoting below ZngabitanT from different threads Blip ssp blip subclass formally proposed Hz Hz " can go as low as a little under Hz and as high as a little over Hz " here https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2758202?page scrollToLastComment true Blip ssp trumpetfish subclass formally proposed Hz Hz Peak frequencies cluster between and Hz and remain between about and Hz here https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Blip ssp varnish run under investigation Hz?

I like the analogy with OS maps and 3D images From my point of view can central frequency and bandwidth along with similarity scores can be disregarded? Sorry I am still confused about peak frequency Is it as I originally thought the frequency of the peak or the frequency of peaks in one second? I have only just realised that individual columns can be sorted I presume only ascending I knew DYCWMI could be sorted I read this in Notes some time ago but stupidly hadn thought to apply it to the normal sim searches It was only in reply to another query that this was mentioned Are there any other tips relating to sim searches? It would be great if the photos of the glitches in the search results were horizontal as in the example rather than vertical Thank you!  Thank you very much for your patient help! The Q transform method based on GWPY seems to have limitations by the way do you know other ways to classify the glitches besides Q transform? When classifying is it usually based on the one dimensional timeseries data or based on the plots based on Q transform? In order Yes that's an example of Omicron having detected additional noise at high frequencies above the Hz top edge of our images in the case of but not in where the central frequency and bandwidth roughly agree with the height of the bliplet but the rectangle is wider than obviously necessary in the latter case the reported duration is seconds enclosing some faint stuff off to the side of the bliplet Probably yes The noisiest frequency the frequency bin where the distribution of noise vs frequency peaks Not the repetition rate of peaks To change from ascending to descending order click a second time on the same column heading The thumbnail pictures were arranged horizontally some years ago until people complained that this took up to much horizontal space and they had to scroll so far sideways to see the numbers Then the arrangement was changed to vertical and we have to scroll a longer way down the page of results Just can't please everyone! On a mobile device like an iPad or using the touchpad on a laptop scrolling horizontally or vertically is equally easy but vertical motions are easier than horizontal ones for people using a mouse with a little scroll wheel so they are better served by the present arrangement  Brilliant! Thank you very much ZngabitanT I must go and try out the sorting ascending and descending!  At the moment while the detection of real gravitational wave signals always relies on the raw timeseries data it has to the Q transform doesn't preserve enough information the classification of individual glitches still relies to a large extent on the Q transform images or even when the observatory operators need a quick overview just on the timestamp peak frequency and SNR without further classification in the form of cluster plots of the bulk distribution E from https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep !

Note that this is a discussion forum associated with the Gravity Spy project on Zooniverse the authors of the gwpy software one of the underlying Python modules used by the Gravity Spy software do not participate here But I'll try to provide an answer based on my limited understanding of the topic The current algorithm which maps glitch noise energy levels to colors works roughly as follows It operates on a one minute long data segment at a time which may contain one or more glitch triggers that will be turned into constant Q transform images showing seconds long pieces of the data The one minute time frequency rectangle is subdivided into many small rectangular tiles and the noise energy in each tile is determined The highest noise energy percentile of any tile in the data segment is used to normalize the energies Then the energy levels from representing the lowest the background level to that highest level are mapped logarithmically to a scale from to and the gradations of this level normalized scale are represented by the hues of the colormap The numbers on the colorbar are simply the steps of on this normalized scale the number marks where on the range from to is So the colors in our images do not represent absolute noise energy levels the normalization will be different from one data segment to the next although it will be the same when multiple Gravity Spy subject images are extracted from one and the same data segment And thanks to this dynamic normalization there is not much truncation and thus not much information lost at high noise energy levels Only the very highest energy percentile of the tiles get painted bright yellow Hope this helps! Please be welcome to ask additional questions on related topics but it is better to start a new discussion thread for a new topic than to take an existing discussion thread and change the topic Thank you for your interest! Yes the 70Hz Blip subclass mackerel can look very chirpish I'm afraid not there's no quick way in Zooniverse to locate the particular page of a collection where a given subject member should appear Maybe some future Zooniverse enhancement could provide such a way but it's not an easy task to implement because the contents of the collection might change in the meantime  Ah I understand thank you but it will take some time to create this this also with 3D rendering engine that works over years ago if you need it I'll separate it into separate thread and reserve my time as image collections  Yes and it was not the only one that night E S was recorded a few minutes later  The Q value is chosen separately for each subject so as to maximize the contrast between the brightest parts and the background For subjects centered on a Blip or Koi Fish this will usually but not always pick on the mostly vertical "body" resulting in a low Q value being chosen For subjects centered on the "outskirts" of a Blip Koi group the choice can depend on subtle details of how the noise is distributed and then we may end up with high Q renderings  Yes corresponding to a lockloss projects zooniverse gravity spy talk on at UTC for no immediately obvious reason The shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions that there had been glitches in both the length and alignment sensing and control loops a tenth of a second earlier  No that is fine thank you Nicm You are doing a brilliant job already!  maybe member of tealight timestamp 21T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page L1O3a 21T Fb UXny 21T pEXPINUZ 21T J WiVUyXn 21T AnsYD70Tgs 21T ufNVldYzVz this 21T amQ ab M 21T NUiavXCeOg 21T BUFxB lVs 21T 5ZmxJqxOJt 21T 9 EBmfN 21T hG9CkV1Y 21T 8QMVKYNglT 21T AKkIUDqBdr 21T rL H mZj 21T tODx NDG 21T 3UGY yE6p 21T XX7Bn T 21T klpOQwMd 21T SjNrGsLTVX 21T IUIEHaibCW 21T boiI T86V 21T iWaM3CEdP 21T 2sOnR1N J 21T UHAnNBIacF 21T suOpchdtE H1O3a 21T wNS8u aKi  I thought as much Is there a way of going through the list of pages any faster I click on then it only seems to go up in small increments How on earth do you manage with scream  When I want to go faster I edit the page part of the URL by hand guesstimating from the subject number I want and from the total number of pages and rough knowledge of the range of subject numbers occurring in the collection on which page I want to be Caveat For a couple of years now the Zooniverse Collections facility has had a bug which had resulted in very large collections more than odd entries being displayed out of order after the first few pages It seems this is getting fixed now but existing large collections are only gradually put back in order  Possible chirp and lower frequency glitches  Oh good grief!

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

Novel Glitch Classes Proposed:\nIn the extensive discussions among citizen scientists in Talk data set 2, there are mentions of potentially new glitch categories that are not listed in the known categories from Talk data set 1. Some of these include:\n   - **"Dolphin shape"** - Mentioned as part of a busy period producing glitches, this could suggest a visual pattern in the data that resembles a dolphin. This might be a novel visual categorization based on the shape and structure of the glitch in the spectogram.\n   - **"Steamwhistle"** - This could imply a glitch that has a sharp, rising, and then quickly falling frequency pattern, similar to the sound of a steam whistle.\n   - **"Hybrid"** - This term might be used to describe glitches that show characteristics of more than one known category and could suggest an overlap or combination of causes/effects in the glitch data.\n\nThese proposed classes suggest that citizen scientists are exploring and identifying complex and nuanced patterns in the data that may not fit neatly into existing categories.\n\n#### 2. Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes, Sensors, or Gravitational Wave Science:\nIn Talk data set 2, several technical and classification questions emerge, indicating a deepening engagement with the data:\n   - **Central frequency and bandwidth:** There is a discussion about whether central frequency and bandwidth, along with similarity scores, can be disregarded when comparing glitches, revealing a question about the relevance and impact of these parameters on glitch classification.\n   - **Effective use of Q transform:** Questions arise about the limitations of the Q transform method and whether there are alternative ways to classify glitches, indicating a pursuit of more accurate or varied analysis techniques.\n\nThese questions reflect an ongoing effort to refine understanding and methodology related to gravitational wave data analysis and glitch classification.\n\n#### 3. Specific Hypotheses about Glitch Origins:\nTalk data set 2 includes discussions that suggest hypotheses regarding the origins of certain glitches, indicative of a deeper analytical approach:\n   - **Environmental impacts:** There are mentions of environmental factors near sensors or errors in sensor measurements themselves that could be causing glitches. This includes questions about how external conditions correlate with the occurrence of glitches.\n   - **Sensor-related errors:** The discussions suggest hypotheses that glitches might be caused by specific technical malfunctions or operational modes of the sensors, which might manifest as unique patterns in the spectrograms.\n\nThese hypotheses demonstrate a keen interest in not just documenting and categorizing glitches, but also in understanding the underlying physical or technical causes, which could help in mitigating these glitches and improving the sensitivity and accuracy of gravitational wave observations.\n\nOverall, Talk data set 2 showcases a more sophisticated and detailed exploration of glitch data compared to Talk data set 1, with innovative categorizations, technical queries, and hypotheses about origins, illustrating an evolution in the citizen scientists\' engagement and expertise with gravitational wave data.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713551437, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_c4e4d95913', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=599, prompt_tokens=22783, total_tokens=23382))

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for unique subclassifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk data set 1:

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards Now I need a new plan Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O so there is no hurry for this information just yet Thank you!

Your list of columns looks good for starters I can think of one more thing I'm afraid will also be necessary a way to keep track of "subject X is a duplicate of subject Y" I'll be pleasantly surprised if we don't encounter some amount of duplication among subjects to be uploaded to Gravity Spy in the future And when multiple identical subjects are similar but not identical to a given one there's no guarantee that similarity search will return all of them nor that the lowest numbered subject will be among those returned The full set of duplicates will only be guaranteed to show up when we run a sim search from one of them and ask for sufficiently many results Some other points also for the benefit of future readers Be sure that you have a way to go back to yesterday's version of a spreadsheet when today's has accidentally got mangled or lost Make backups and verify that you can restore from a backup Cloud storage may be suitable here Objectives may expand there's no foretelling what new weird and wonderful glitches are going to show up during O Experiment with a small toy spreadsheet Can you add another column as an afterthought without breaking anything you were able to do with it before adding the column? An additional column won't need to be fully populated immediately for all the subject rows already in the spreadsheet there'll be plenty of further subjects added later and missing information about earlier subjects can be filled in occasionally General criteria for deciding what to include Anything you want to be able to search for g the subject number in case it comes up again anything you want to be able to sort by anything you want to be able to filter on in particular an indication whether the subject is "done" or still in your "to do" queue whether or not you have already fed it back to a similarity search Any column that changes from empty to non empty when you use a subject for a fresh search would suffice or you could use a marker for "to do" items and remove it when "done" and then anything you want to have at your fingertips without having to load the Zooniverse subject page anew or to run the collection through DYCWMI g Q value contributors who had brought up the subject in Talk or previously collected it peak frequency A column identifying the interferometer won't be needed when you plan on keeping separate spreadsheets for each site which has some advantages for all their similarities Hanford and Livingston have never had exactly the same glitch mix I've been mostly interested in bringing subjects into chronological order so for me the date time stamps when the subject was triggered were the first thing I started tracking after the subject numbers Other stuff Q value peak frequency SNR contributors free text annotations got added to my lists over the years as the need arose Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance I've also been keeping track of "zooid does not exist" cases subjects that had never made it into the Gravity Spy tools database You may not have a need for this such subjects can't come up among the results of similarity searches  Neither what I see here is a superposition blend of two probably unrelated glitches Like the Livingston tea light projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches are but this here is not a proper tea light either The peak frequency is reported as Hz so the dominant glitch is the loud triangular borderline between Tomte and Koi thing between about and Hz A Blip subclass varnish run glitch happened a few milliseconds earlier reaching down from the top to about Hz though not bright yellow all the way to the top thus a borderline member of this putative subclass But it's neither quite central nor the dominant feature  Yes we've had some of these occasionally during the third observing run Their first frames can look confusingly similar to those of Hz Line glitches But the latter never come in such wavy arrangements they happened once every minutes while they were happening during a brief period in April only  It's generally not necessary to annotate the obvious Gravity Spy is a bit too large for that with nearly two million active subjects and chance combinations hybrids aren't all that rare What I often do is add them to a suitable one of my collections instead But do feel free to bring up unusual subjects or questionable cases in Talk! Thanks for replying to me I did not notice silent edit If you were going to do small trial run with spreadsheets I was planning on outputting it in specific format along with improving tools myself what I do know is that what I cannot get from DYCWMI is timestamp currently today however once I can get character hash it's not too hard to be surprised might as well choose 'notes' to leave something as other attribute column something versatile It might also be good thing to keep columns that are added at a later date in separate tables and in reference form  Alas that was little too far away timestamp 10T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page L1O3b 10T qZ6QG6AUVf 10T 8EbipPoPhE 10T tLKzn BSz 10T BxQMjU99wP 10T hqzROquOji 10T 9T sj fT 10T I8B aJMm 10T 5g JVsO0v 10T dMaORGSEVF 10T ergyoE1d 10T 6 WfDf 10T sz J4GRTD H1O3b 10T 6lM JuHw 10T 8PXINsEGlW 10T i qIFE2LT 10T ttrO ak 10T Bigh Njd 10T A Q9OoV8s 10T bAP npSe 10T BdLsIWIkrZ 10T mAVlqqEnfK 10T jLevyNasU 10T 82BL7EJCJw 10T oIUwNkUNQW 10T tP42ZbJxwl 10T IhbdRR3Qtb 10T vCywMdcyaw 10T tsVFrDRMLj this 10T TmDzttAK same 10T gvy nGUfx same 10T GjSX5q Zx same 10T KHnuCyUP same 10T kaQueZGQTZ 10T qRiPEgJENO 10T OKfZyvgFwj 10T TWUK87S2w 10T NWF PmXEs 10T hmxyM2CMyh 10T r MvEWIJb 10T 8WezmJCFO 10T HJf hoXS 10T KKFYMRHM 10T FFoOHX7odG 10T IyEYxsfFil 10T Q036soLscL 10T RWzEPzcBpE 10T K MwfS3yx  Thank you very much ZngabitanT All my stuff gets backed up to the cloud every day Knowing me I will probably print out the data regularly Any duplicates I come across at the moment are on the individual sim searches I just write the numbers out and write delete next to all but the lowest number I keep all the sim search printouts making a note of the subject used for each search Should I type all these up in a word type document? With regard to the searches at the moment I have had primary secondary tertiary lists I initially looked at the bliplets collection and chose those subjects that look like raindrop I made a list of these subject and used each one at a time for a sim search All new raindrops I wrote next to the original subject until I had gone through that first list I then compiled a secondary list showing both the initial subject used for the search and the secondary subjects to be used for the next searches And so on ad nauseam! Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Now my brain hurts!  So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date?  There are many ways of doing things and many ways of organizing queues whatever works is fine > Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Yes but it's easier to not add them to a collection in the first place if the collection is intended to be representative of the timeline rather than to mark everything that matches its criteria than it is to find and remove them afterwards > So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date? Only if you're interested in the dates and times down to the minutes! I've been doing it especially for Virgo subjects because the Virgo subject numbers are much more scrambled out of chronological order than the LIGO ones Once as we all hope periodic uploads of recently recorded LIGO subjects resume for ER and O subjects coming from the same day will once again get numbers from a limited range and subjects coming from the next day will get higher numbers so the numbers will already provide an approximation to the date time stamps though they'll still be disordered on timescales of minutes and up to a few hours That'll be good enough for many purposes Glitch classes correlating with very bad windy weather will already stand out for example  An afterthought Also once periodic uploads of fresh subjects resume cascaded similarity searches will be less useful for a while than looking at the fresh subjects classifying as far as possible with the available classes while completely new things might be happening! and keeping an eye on what everyone else will be posting in Talk Sim Search isn't clairvoyant it can't yet see glitches that will happen only tomorrow The cascaded approach is more useful for exploring a realm of already uploaded subjects from past eras  I must admit it would be good to get back to some classifying before I completely forget what is what!  Agriculture and landscaping 46Hz around UTC   52Hz Pirate ship 05  41Hz around UTC Cuneiform  05Hz around UTC   41Hz around UTC Slightly cuneiform?  64Hz I expected a much higher frequency around UTC Artefact around 150Hz ? Pirate ship sailing on scattered light?  This dates from between and UTC it's the first subject from Virgo from that hour for which I've seen an approximate timestamp and in frame I spot artefact bands at least at and Hz plus that gradually fading feature near Hz where there ought to be a perfectly stationary never supposed to become visible as a transient spectral line associated with regulating the frequency wavelength of Virgo's main laser I'll bet there's something willow like just over the 2s edge a glitch originating in the laser amplifier and with overtone rich features with msec periodicity just what willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are but it must be either a very peculiar one that hasn't ever come up in a similarity search anchored on another of six hundred odd willows or else it's one that's missing from the Gravity Spy tools database Good catch in any case!  It nice to be back finding things like this again  Hi mitchnanny Regarding ZngabitanT's comment above > Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance While I cannot provide the specific instructions for an iPad as I do not use one here is an outline on how I work with spreadsheet software on a Windows laptop to manage sim searches and collections under study I first sort the sim search results original page by SNR either ascending or descending Then I download the Excel option of the search results as an xlsx file I rename the file with interferometer name era run and seed subject number Then I follow these general steps This is just an overview to give an idea on how I work without describing in detail all actions as you want to keep it simple Using a spreadsheet software I upload the downloaded xlsx file into a new spreadsheet I rename the spreadsheet with interferometer name era run glitch name under study and other information to find it back quickly The uploaded file appears in a new tab a sheet within the spreadsheet automatically formatted with all the columns from the sim search page I rename this tab with the seed subject number I mark the seed subject in the sheet Looking for multiple copies I look at the SNR column where the numbers appear already sorted I paint red those cells along subject number and keep them for future reference I keep the lowest multiple subject number for consistency and paint the cell blue for future reference Now I copy paste one by one the representative subject numbers find their corresponding GS page and see if they fit my collection In this way I can grow representative collections as the multiplicity issue has already been dealt with in the spreadsheet Still a double check is always essential before posting a collection to ensure that there are no multiple copies overlooked somewhere In this way the collection histogram will give a clean representation on glitch density I add an extra column to my sheets where I annotate whether a subject already exists in my collection or was newly added Hence I can pick better new seeds Here is where I discover borderline and possibly new glitches or those intrusively appearing in searches for instance H O Whistle on Blip ssp Trumpetfish For each sim search I also add to the sheet the corresponding histogram as an image insert Then I feed representative subject numbers from my sheet into loops of sim searches For each new search result I proceed as in the steps above download file with SNR already sorted create new sheet tab and name it accordingly look for multiple subject copies retrieve subject page grow collections pick aliens add histogram notes jot down questions and so on Repeat for each sim search performed In the end I ll have a whole spreadsheet file on a given interferometer and particular era or run for a given glitch study containing all the sim searches grouped under seed numbers tabs multiple subjects excluded lowest numbers picked all the subjects that I added to specific collections those discarded borderline and alien ones seeds fed to the ensuing sim searches all the histograms and several notes I create a new spreadsheet file for a new interferometer or a new era run that I want to perform sim searches upon by using the first sim search run then proceed as above So I have one file for each interferometer on a particular era run and also for the other interferometers accordingly I also used the spreadsheets for the Blip ssp Trumpetfish training sets and anything in between that needed to be looked upon A spreadsheet software may offer Insights charts like those I posted in my threads on the Trumpetfish investigation which give additional views and understanding on the data One thing that I found useful during the lengthy glitch investigation is that a spreadsheet gives a compact view of the sim search results without all the scrolling forth and back on the original page Also as I was doing moderate to large sim searches I could manage more than results when needed other times I had to test certain issues with the recommended maximum number of results It also allows for a detailed study of the other parameters while it is easy to sort filter and find values across sheets The spreadsheets helped me to keep a digital and retrievable history of the sim searches and findings seeds multiple subject numbers and lowest numbers picked the evolution of histograms notes and discoveries along the way I continue to use this method in my current investigations of several Blip potential subclasses So all this is just a glimpse on how I juggle sim searches and growing collections in a manageable and trackable way You can add to your sheets any column attribute you might find useful and over time you will feel what works best for you Spreadsheets have myriad functions and actions but you can keep it as simple as necessary to suit your needs Hope it helps it actually goes swiftly with practice There is this Apple tutorial Create a spreadsheet in Numbers on iPad https support apple com guide

The subsequent extremely loud noise associated with the lockloss in S has produced extensive data processing artefacts across the whole minute long data segment from which the spectrograms for these three Hanford subjects were produced The blips in S and in the present S are taller than they look they are half hidden behind the dark artefact bands This is best visible when looking at the fourth frames using the "half moon" button to toggle between normal and inverted colours also helps The relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions the lockloss but provides no further details about what caused it  Thank you Coralbell I will definitely have a few practise spreadsheets I will have to sort out some sort of filing system It is a bit fiddly on the iPad You mention adding the bar graph with the sim searches Does that have to be done via Imgur? I hope the answer is no !  Gladfully no haha! There must be an "Insert image" or similar function on your iPad spreadsheet Simply save the histogram image from GS to your device and then use the spreadsheet function to add it on your sheet  I downloaded the dataset from here BUT I doubt there are some instances in the "Extremely Loud" class that are misclassified !

What happened there is that the immense amount of noise just past the right edge upset the preprocessing whitening algorithm acting on the minute long data segment from which the seconds wide spectrograms were extracted The strain channel was already extremely noisy at time seconds but it then got a whole lot noisier over the next few seconds by several orders of magnitude and the algorithms used at the time reacted by producing very small numbers and very dark spectrogram colors for the seconds window we get to see This was pointed out a while later apropos of a similar subject from the second observing run the first use of the zerosignal hashtag in Gravity Spy Talk one of the comments there provides some further explanation projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 466268?comment Training the Machine Learning to recognize such nearly zero signal spectrograms as originating from events that truly are extremely loud it can't get any worse than the interferometer losing the lock! had been useful at the time even though it looks confusing at first glance to our human eyes Hope this sheds some light on the matter!

Thank you dear mitchnanny I am confident you will find yor way and am so glad again to hear that you learnt this much today  Hmmm it was too difficult to scour usual major giant corporate software instruction manuals and imagine what I needed todo to figure out steps to get necessary files and data together Best help possible for me was to create Linux like batch file assuming I wanted to process some data in shell scripts I was just a kid then as can be imagined in the days before release of Windows we picked it up from junk and built various ecosystems to use up last of computer's life and here we are today What now replaced spreadsheet was direct use of Relational DataBase engine a GNU software suite of traditional SQL language with no additional licensing required for older software manual sheets are still paper based no need to download huge PDFs using a paid internet connection and operating procedures have not changed from then to now This is biggest advantage we can continue to have all users process something in exactly the same way I'm envisioned discussing various glitched data using exactly same results in those ways!

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes! It involves a lot of tapping provided you have the correct bit highlighted Thank you Coralbell I have printed out the instructions I couldn find anything about it yesterday At least I know it can be done in Numbers I actually have all my sim searches for my main two collections kept as printouts in folders As I go on I get more organised with them so if necessary I can go back to them I cross reference from my index cards It only in the last few months I have been cascading or I imagine I have looking for raindrop and fly bliplets so have dozens of printouts  True Also the present subject is the only one from the group above that was rendered at  Oops I did forget sigh don't know what I was thinking about Thank you so much for reminding me and also for proposing the "blip subclass blip" Without your reference subjects and description I would have only added to the collection subjects that were taller than Hz  Blip and small fireball  fireball koi   sprites  repeating koi   bliplet at 40hz Glad to hear that you could find it and keeping the instructions handy is always a good idea Both links I sent you along this conversation refer to Numbers User Guide for iPad https support apple com guide numbers ipad welcome ipados There is a Table of Contents covering different help topics which could serve as a useful reference in the future I am sorry that I do not own an iPad to give you specific answers for that device but I am happy to share any knowledge I might have to help you sort things out  You have been amazingly helpful Coralbell All this must have taken you away from your own important work Thank you  Sorry about the confusion ZngabitanT and glad that you referenced my paragraph where I mention Droplet so that the differences are sorted out and now we welcome Mackerel to the Blip family!

rectangular time frequency regions between a lower and a higher frequency and between a start and end time and computes the amount of noise or sometimes real GW signal intensity when a GW comes along that's present within each rectangle Any rectangle where the noise level exceeds a predetermined threshold and which are not contained within a larger rectangle that's also noisy above the threshold get called out by Omicron as "triggers" Well it doesn't actually shout of course it writes out a brief description of what it thought it had found to a file This description includes the event time the middle point of the rectangle's extent in time the moment in time that gets mapped to " seconds" in our subject images and the central frequency in Hz the middle of the rectangle in the frequency direction but on a linear scale just taking the average of lower and upper bounding frequency of the rectangle so we know where the rectangle was It includes the width of the rectangle along the time axis as the duration in seconds and the height of the rectangle along the frequency axis as the bandwidth again expressed in Hz Thus central frequency minus half the bandwidth recovers the lower bounding frequency of the rectangle and central frequency plus half the bandwidth gives the upper bounding frequency So we also know how large the rectangle was Blips will often get reported in tall rectangles of short duration "line" glitches in long duration rectangles spanning only a small bandwidth of frequencies But Omicron quite often reports an even larger rectangle for reasons that aren't always obvious Sometimes it's because of additional noise between and kHz that we don't get to see So the reported duration and bandwidth values need to be taken with a grain of salt The preceding do not yet imply anything about the shape and intensity of the glitch contained in the rectangle Imagine a three dimensional model time by frequency by noise intensity where the noise intensity sticks out of the screen Our colour scheme from dark violet to bright yellow is then a measure of how far it sticks out as in a map of a mountain landscape where colours represent altitude The peak frequency is approximately the frequency where the highest peak of this mountain is located where the mountain of noise sticks the most out of the screen But it's not exact it's more like merely naming just the grid square on an Ordnance Survey map inside which the true peak is located That's the "binning" we've been discussing And the snr signal to background noise ratio is a measure of how tall the peak is how far it sticks out of the screen It's useful for finding duplicates because it's computed from the raw data which are never exactly equal for two different glitches in a way that doesn't involve any discrete binning "Tallest peak" means tallest within the particular trigger rectangle that Omicron was reporting not tallest within the whole seconds wide and 2Khz tall region that later gets rendered as a Gravity Spy spectrogram image There may be more than one trigger rectangle within the same spectrogram region and the other glitches may have peaks that are even taller than the glitch around time seconds that was responsible for the trigger Such as the very loud glitch on the left side "stage right" in the Gravity Spy logo image And occasionally we end up with a rather dark area around seconds flanked by bright yellow on both sides Omicron sometimes regards groups of glitchlets as one single glitch that gets reported as one single noisy rectangle and then it's possible for the central time to fall in the middle between two or more glitchlets noise peaks Finally the similarity score does not come from Omicron and is not a property of the single glitch subject it's a measure how closely a subject resembles the given one that was used to start the search means they're the same glitch would be as dissimilar as possible In the DYCWMI tool this column remains empty since it would be meaningless In order for a broadband connection to deliver a high bandwidth in the bytes second sense it needs to use a sufficiently broad range of frequencies for the underlying physical signals on the wire so in that sense it's analogous Hope this helps!

I like the analogy with OS maps and 3D images From my point of view can central frequency and bandwidth along with similarity scores can be disregarded? Sorry I am still confused about peak frequency Is it as I originally thought the frequency of the peak or the frequency of peaks in one second? I have only just realised that individual columns can be sorted I presume only ascending I knew DYCWMI could be sorted I read this in Notes some time ago but stupidly hadn thought to apply it to the normal sim searches It was only in reply to another query that this was mentioned Are there any other tips relating to sim searches? It would be great if the photos of the glitches in the search results were horizontal as in the example rather than vertical Thank you!  Thank you very much for your patient help! The Q transform method based on GWPY seems to have limitations by the way do you know other ways to classify the glitches besides Q transform? When classifying is it usually based on the one dimensional timeseries data or based on the plots based on Q transform? In order Yes that's an example of Omicron having detected additional noise at high frequencies above the Hz top edge of our images in the case of but not in where the central frequency and bandwidth roughly agree with the height of the bliplet but the rectangle is wider than obviously necessary in the latter case the reported duration is seconds enclosing some faint stuff off to the side of the bliplet Probably yes The noisiest frequency the frequency bin where the distribution of noise vs frequency peaks Not the repetition rate of peaks To change from ascending to descending order click a second time on the same column heading The thumbnail pictures were arranged horizontally some years ago until people complained that this took up to much horizontal space and they had to scroll so far sideways to see the numbers Then the arrangement was changed to vertical and we have to scroll a longer way down the page of results Just can't please everyone! On a mobile device like an iPad or using the touchpad on a laptop scrolling horizontally or vertically is equally easy but vertical motions are easier than horizontal ones for people using a mouse with a little scroll wheel so they are better served by the present arrangement  Brilliant! Thank you very much ZngabitanT I must go and try out the sorting ascending and descending!  At the moment while the detection of real gravitational wave signals always relies on the raw timeseries data it has to the Q transform doesn't preserve enough information the classification of individual glitches still relies to a large extent on the Q transform images or even when the observatory operators need a quick overview just on the timestamp peak frequency and SNR without further classification in the form of cluster plots of the bulk distribution E from https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep ! example LIGO glitch cluster plot https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG uploads Screenshotfrom png https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG uploads Screenshotfrom png Virgo uses something similar from https logbook virgo gw eu virgo ?r ! example Virgo glitch cluster plot https logbook virgo gw eu virgo uploads Screenshot 20from png https logbook virgo gw eu virgo uploads Screenshot 20from png The classification by our volunteer community here on Zooniverse relies on everything we can get our hands on spectrogram images metadata accompanying the glitch triggers date time stamp peak frequency SNR and on scrutinizing the observatory logbooks for clues what was going on around the time We can certainly make finer distinctions than we could based on the Q transform images alone For examples see the LIGO projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and Virgo projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposals in our Talk pages On the other hand the detector engineers' analysis of the causes of glitches makes heavy use of the many hundreds of auxiliary data channels recorded alongside the strain channel keeping track of environmental factors seismometers accelerometers microphones magnetometers room temperature and humidity wind and weather data and so forth as well as of many instrumental parameters See our Talk > Help > Resources projects zooniverse gravity spy talk page for links to some relevant papers esp those mentioning "environmental noise" in their titles Gravity Spy projects zooniverse gravity spy talk in preparation will include auxiliary LIGO channels GWitchHunters projects reinforce gwitchhunters already does so for Virgo  thanks! was wondering what was up

If you put a cut to the colorbar it will be inevitably cause some lose of Glitch's information then is the glitch classification based only on 2D images still be reliably?

Note that this is a discussion forum associated with the Gravity Spy project on Zooniverse the authors of the gwpy software one of the underlying Python modules used by the Gravity Spy software do not participate here But I'll try to provide an answer based on my limited understanding of the topic The current algorithm which maps glitch noise energy levels to colors works roughly as follows It operates on a one minute long data segment at a time which may contain one or more glitch triggers that will be turned into constant Q transform images showing seconds long pieces of the data The one minute time frequency rectangle is subdivided into many small rectangular tiles and the noise energy in each tile is determined The highest noise energy percentile of any tile in the data segment is used to normalize the energies Then the energy levels from representing the lowest the background level to that highest level are mapped logarithmically to a scale from to and the gradations of this level normalized scale are represented by the hues of the colormap The numbers on the colorbar are simply the steps of on this normalized scale the number marks where on the range from to is So the colors in our images do not represent absolute noise energy levels the normalization will be different from one data segment to the next although it will be the same when multiple Gravity Spy subject images are extracted from one and the same data segment And thanks to this dynamic normalization there is not much truncation and thus not much information lost at high noise energy levels Only the very highest energy percentile of the tiles get painted bright yellow Hope this helps!

Hi mitchnanny while it is inevitable to browse collection pages to find a given subject in them with practice you make better guesses and jump pages to look for duplicates simply run the DYCWMI on the collection then sort the SNR column and find such duplicates  Yes but you still need to locate a duplicated subject on its collection page if you want to delete it from the collection It would help if this could be done from the subject's own page through a little button on the collection thumbnail picture and then a popup asking for confirmation to avoid accidental deletions but that remains a Zooniverse functionality desideratum for the future  Yes Thank you Coralbell and ZngabitanT I have used snr to find duplicates and printed out the list so I could peruse at leisure I am resigned to the tedium of finding the correct page I jump several pages until I am in the correct place assuming they are in order  Certainly so I see that I misunderstood the question as just finding duplicates to delete them from a collection one needs to locate them by hand I am also for an easier deletion process from collections  You are welcome mitchnanny tedious it is You may peek at the first and last subject number in a collection page to see the subject number range for that page and keep scrolling if your subject is not within it  pp postpre hybrid Line at Hz   blip subclass blip   23hz  shroud  blip subclass blip   medusa  blip subclass blip   19hz braid   25hz hurdler?

Fireball Virgo O ? Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and good job checking the fourth frame! This is a somewhat curious catch After scratching my head for a while the group at time seconds looks rather too complex to be another simple blip it might be an example of a proposed class of LIGO fireballs So I'd lean towards classifying this as a Blip which happens to have happened less than two seconds after another kind of glitch And indeed it turns out that the present subject is among those which had been used to train the Machine Learning as an example of a Blip You can see that label when you click on the nfo button Only subjects from the ML training set have such labels In the first three workflow levels where the Repeating Blips class is not yet available the alternative would be to call it None Of The Above which ensures that more people are going to get a look and which helps to shift such subjects towards the more advanced workflows offering additional classes But the general rule for combinations of two or more different kinds of glitches is to focus on the one closest to time seconds or dominant at this time provided that it's recognizable and ignore the rest This helps to teach the ML to recognize common glitch types even in crowded surroundings Thank you for contributing! This happened at LIGO Hanford not at Virgo during the third rather than the second observing run so the Virgo O specific glitch class cannot apply but the group as a whole shares some fireballish traits closely but irregularly spaced repetitions of short duration broadband constituent "glitchlets" Possible LIGO analogues of Virgo's fireballs are still being studied and thus not yet available as an official class For the moment I would recommend to call this subject a Koi Fish based on the central feature Please be welcome though to start a collection of subjects reminding you of fireballs! Like some of us have already been doing And or of anything else that looks worth collecting to you  Tips just display DYCWMI collection and assign sequential number g line numbers divide that number by and add that will be pages you want to find  Thank you I will try that out  Yes indeed good point except in cases when the collection contains "zooid does not exist" subjects that don't show up among the DYCWMI output then it'll be slightly off Fortunately that can't happen when a collection has been built up entirely from the results of prior similarity searches  I don know how to add line numbers Maybe I will leave this for now  Perhaps it might be easier on laptop computer open text file with any editor and give it a line number to check ex sort by subject number and then download as csv in Excel worksheet shows header row by default as reference and Linux for me I always check it this way vi " set number" Downloads any csv and see  Thank you Nicm I use an iPad but have Pages I think the time I would need to learn how to do this would be far greater than just going through the pages of my collections but I will bear it in mind  Maybe I could use Numbers on the iPad but I am having a break from that at the moment  I have had a look at Apple Numbers and the lines are already numbered except the is one place too high Presumably you would have to sort by snr first to get the duplicates then sort by subject to get the order that they should theoretically appear in the collection I can see this would be useful for huge collections I really appreciate your help Nicm though at the moment I will stick to the way I know but it has been another useful exercise looking at how I could use Numbers in the future   line Series of 25sb  line  line Another interloper in my bliplet searches 07Hz what sea creature is this?

I was drafting a post about identical SNRs for different subjects I came upon them some time ago but had no time till now to look back at those cases into more detail Yes it might be unfortunately more common than expected Will elaborate further when I post  That was a bug in the version of the spectrogram computing software in use at the time late when the Virgo O2a subjects were processed in preparation for uploading them to Zooniverse Back then the 25s window was somewhat incorrectly cut out of the time series of raw data More often this shows up as a dark feature in the bottom right corner of the first frame that has no counterpart in the subsequent frames Here we have a less common example where it has produced a spurious bright blob  Good to hear about the keyboard it will certainly easy things Glad you are managing Numbers better  Thank you I am glad it not me! I will leave both of them in the collection The odds against getting that exact number must be pretty high! Collection deleted I am a bit bogged down with all this today  Let say I am a bit better than I was last time! I used to print my DYCWMI but my bliplets take up pages so I am not wasting that much paper Therefore it had to be Numbers  A few spot checks say that while more common than expected when I expected it to never happen in practice such coincidences are still very rare occurs four times in the whole O data release and I've found some other values which occur two or three times within all of LIGO O The occurrences are widely separated in time glitch classes other metadata values and places of origin one of the four is from Hanford so they can't be mistaken for one another Thus the SNR column still serves for spotting duplicates when they are present we just need to be aware that a repeated value might not necessarily indicate a duplicate subject  Thank you Interesting Aren I lucky to have two in my bliplets collection?!  Thank you for the feedback ZngabitanT If you spotted those instances in the whole O data release it gives an idea of how contained it is for O The SNR column is still very valuable I had spotted occasional instances by opening the subject page for every plicate retrieved in past sim searches but was not sure whether it had been a tool hiccup or a pattern  Hi There are instances where the SNR value from sim search results is identical for different glitches as it would also be the more general case of pointing to multiple identical copies of a single glitch Below is a quartet of results from a Hanford O sim search for seed https www zooniverse org We have four different glitches under the same SNR and the rest of metadata values For SNR https www zooniverse org Sardine https www zooniverse org Elongated Blip https www zooniverse org Trumpetfish https www zooniverse org Whistle Some time ago Hanford O Whistle appeared profusely in sim search results for Blip ssp trumpetfish sardine and similar morphologies I suspect that the tool confusion above for this identical quartet might be caused by a similar sim search bias Regarding collection management I see two scenarios so far on how to practically handle this issue each with their pros and cons Not adding false duplicates to collections Different glitches with identical SNR are left out This would not change the already time consuming cleanup routine involving multiple steps to produce a representative collection Adding false duplicates to collections Different glitches with identical SNR are part of a collection Some subjects being true copies while others false ones would increase the number of routines to produce a representative collection While this might occur sporadically there is an extra aspect to look into for SNR identical values Thank you Related conversation https www zooniverse org where mitchnanny was also experiencing this uncommon issue  it kinda looks like scattered light but if you look at the longer timespan the shape becomes a bit weird idk at first it looks like a low frequency line but lasts way too little to be one very short low frequency line  it looks like a blip and a whistle fused together I'm afraid I can't reproduce this example as described Running a similarity search asking for the maximum number of results ifo H era O starting from and sorting the results on the SNR column returns four occurrences of the SNR value and these are identical quadruplicate copies of a single glitch trigger There are no other LIGO O subjects with this exact SNR value I've checked this in the data release https doi org zenodo have a reported SNR of this value coincidentally occurs once again for one unrelated glitch subject from Livingston O3b has SNR unique among LIGO O subjects has SNR unique among LIGO O subjects has SNR which reoccurs just once in LIGO O for a Livingston O3b subject In any case there is no confusion here on the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search 's part it merely reports the SNR values that had been computed by the Omicron glitch detection software when it was originally triggered and there is no a priori guarantee that the computed values for different glitches must be different This is merely rather unlikely a priori because the values are the outcome of a calculation based on the raw glitch data and not unlike the peak frequencies merely a selection from a predefined list of discrete bins Also the similarity scoring doesn't take the SNR values into account so it cannot be confused by them There's no reason not to include two manifestly different subjects with coinciding SNR values in a collection when both fit the collection criteria in other respects It's only the inclusion of genuinely duplicate subjects coming from one and the same glitch trigger which would bias any conclusions about glitch rates that one may subsequently try to draw from the collection Repeated SNR values in a collection are not themselves an issue checking for repeated SNR values is merely the quickest way I know of for finding any real duplications in a collection  Yes this is a Scattered Light glitch and one of the last of this loud multi arch kind from Hanford By the time it was recorded on a fix had already been applied at Livingston and two days after it was recorded the same fix was rolled out at Hanford too Afterwards the engineers used Gravity Spy data to validate that their fix was as effective as they had hoped! These are quite hard to recognize until one has seen a lot of them actually it's a Crown thus None Of The Above in levels but processed with unusually fine frequency resolution at the expense of unusually coarse time resolution  This subject will fit into a proposed new glitch class of Coronets projects zooniverse gravity spy talk "little crowns" They first showed up in large numbers in mid January sharing the fast pacing of Crowns but staying confined to a narrow frequency band around Hz  Interesting catch! It's primarily a Whistle and yes it is fused with something I can't quite tell what that something might be but it seems to affect only frequencies below about Hz everything higher up is part of the Whistle  Sounds good thank you for letting me know! Thank you for the explanations This is puzzling as I got my identical quadruplicate false copies with SNR for a search on results on Han O with said seed This same search also yielded an additional two pairs of different subjects with identical SNR For SNR like your Han and Liv above https www zooniverse org https www zooniverse org and For SNR https www zooniverse org https www zooniverse org See below a snippet showing these cases from the spreadsheet downloaded from the sim search already sorted by SNR I added an empty line between the instances !

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk data set 2 realtive to Talk data set 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    3. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9FnL6UxKyyBxhLbmgOq69Ao0AR31A', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='From Talk data set 2, the discussions indicate several key areas where citizen scientists are extending their understanding and categorization of gravitational wave sensor glitches. Here’s an analysis based on the three points of interest mentioned.\n\n1. **New Glitch Classes Proposed**:\n   - **Coronets**: Described as "little crowns," these glitches first appeared in significant numbers around mid-January. They share the fast pacing of Crowns but are confined to a narrow frequency band around 70 Hz. This proposal suggests a subset of the Crown glitch but with distinct characteristics that warrant a separate classification.\n   - **Gnarly Whistles**: This proposed class appears to represent a variant of Whistles, sometimes tagged as \'drizzle.\' The discussions suggest that these are complex enough in their structure, showing a fusion of elements from different classes, which might not fit comfortably into the existing categories.\n\n2. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects**:\n   - **Classification Reliability with Q Transform**: There is a question about the reliability of glitch classification based solely on 2D images from Q transform, especially concerning loss of information due to the colorbar cut operation. This question reflects a deeper inquiry into the limitations of the current analytical methods and the potential loss of critical glitch information during visualization and classification processes.\n   - **Effect of SNR Coincidences**: Another technical inquiry arose from the observation of different glitches showing the same SNR value. This unusual occurrence sparked discussions on the possibility of identical SNR values indicating different glitch types, raising concerns about potential confusion in correctly identifying and classifying glitches.\n\n3. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins**:\n   - **Environmental Influence and Equipment Interference**: One hypothesis discussed relates to the environmental influence on glitches, such as scattered light anomalies, which might be linked to stray reflections of laser light by moving objects in the vicinity of the test masses, a recurring theme in glitch origin discussions. Another hypothesis involves interference from electronic equipment accidentally left on near the vacuum chambers, suggesting that external electronic devices could influence sensor readings.\n   - **Analytical Motivation**: The motivation behind these hypotheses is to correlate specific external conditions or operational errors with the occurrences of certain glitches. By identifying the environmental or operational triggers, the discussions aim to improve the predictive understanding of glitch occurrences, which could lead to better mitigation strategies and refinement of sensor operations.\n\nThese discussions in Talk data set 2 show a sophisticated level of engagement from the citizen scientists, who are not only identifying new types of glitches but are also critically evaluating the methodologies used for glitch analysis and classification. Additionally, the exploration of external influences on glitch occurrences reflects a holistic approach to understanding and solving the complexities of gravitational wave data analysis.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713551608, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_c4e4d95913', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=549, prompt_tokens=31111, total_tokens=31660))

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards Now I need a new plan Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O so there is no hurry for this information just yet Thank you!  Thank you mitchnanny and Nic ! Thank you Nicm I like being able to see the two "near time subjects" I guess this one can be classified as fireball koi instead of repeating koi  Correction there doesn't seem to be a koi so only fireballs     bliplet at 40hz plus four other smaller features   fireball koi  Clair de lune?  bliplet at 40hz  fireball koi   19hz braid  crown at Q5? 19hz  candle  Hz not long enough to qualify as Hz line   bliplet at 40hz  483hz line  ZngabitanT Would this one qualify as borderline varnish run blip or should it be a borderline varnish run koi? Crowns at Q22?  coronet  repeating koi   20hz  bliplet at 40hz  koi fireball at Q11 Strange high frequency crown ? Standard crown is at Hz Hi mitchnanny I will include this in my task in the near future and will post it after tomorrow if I can get permission to use metadata from mitchnanny collection and plan to plot timestamps of merge with my own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page in addition to this I'm looking for different Q values in the previous and next subjects with some glitches from ' Fireballish with koi projects zooniverse gravity spy collections mitchnanny livingston fireballish with koi ' collections  Hi Nicm of course you may use metadata from my collections The help I need is just in doing a basic spreadsheet in Numbers on the iPad nothing complicated! This is for future collections not existing ones I will carry on with cards until the collections are no longer needed I was just wondering about other column headings if any for the future I don want you to go to a lot of trouble!

Your list of columns looks good for starters I can think of one more thing I'm afraid will also be necessary a way to keep track of "subject X is a duplicate of subject Y" I'll be pleasantly surprised if we don't encounter some amount of duplication among subjects to be uploaded to Gravity Spy in the future And when multiple identical subjects are similar but not identical to a given one there's no guarantee that similarity search will return all of them nor that the lowest numbered subject will be among those returned The full set of duplicates will only be guaranteed to show up when we run a sim search from one of them and ask for sufficiently many results Some other points also for the benefit of future readers Be sure that you have a way to go back to yesterday's version of a spreadsheet when today's has accidentally got mangled or lost Make backups and verify that you can restore from a backup Cloud storage may be suitable here Objectives may expand there's no foretelling what new weird and wonderful glitches are going to show up during O Experiment with a small toy spreadsheet Can you add another column as an afterthought without breaking anything you were able to do with it before adding the column? An additional column won't need to be fully populated immediately for all the subject rows already in the spreadsheet there'll be plenty of further subjects added later and missing information about earlier subjects can be filled in occasionally General criteria for deciding what to include Anything you want to be able to search for g the subject number in case it comes up again anything you want to be able to sort by anything you want to be able to filter on in particular an indication whether the subject is "done" or still in your "to do" queue whether or not you have already fed it back to a similarity search Any column that changes from empty to non empty when you use a subject for a fresh search would suffice or you could use a marker for "to do" items and remove it when "done" and then anything you want to have at your fingertips without having to load the Zooniverse subject page anew or to run the collection through DYCWMI g Q value contributors who had brought up the subject in Talk or previously collected it peak frequency A column identifying the interferometer won't be needed when you plan on keeping separate spreadsheets for each site which has some advantages for all their similarities Hanford and Livingston have never had exactly the same glitch mix I've been mostly interested in bringing subjects into chronological order so for me the date time stamps when the subject was triggered were the first thing I started tracking after the subject numbers Other stuff Q value peak frequency SNR contributors free text annotations got added to my lists over the years as the need arose Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance I've also been keeping track of "zooid does not exist" cases subjects that had never made it into the Gravity Spy tools database You may not have a need for this such subjects can't come up among the results of similarity searches  Neither what I see here is a superposition blend of two probably unrelated glitches Like the Livingston tea light projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches are but this here is not a proper tea light either The peak frequency is reported as Hz so the dominant glitch is the loud triangular borderline between Tomte and Koi thing between about and Hz A Blip subclass varnish run glitch happened a few milliseconds earlier reaching down from the top to about Hz though not bright yellow all the way to the top thus a borderline member of this putative subclass But it's neither quite central nor the dominant feature  Yes we've had some of these occasionally during the third observing run Their first frames can look confusingly similar to those of Hz Line glitches But the latter never come in such wavy arrangements they happened once every minutes while they were happening during a brief period in April only  It's generally not necessary to annotate the obvious Gravity Spy is a bit too large for that with nearly two million active subjects and chance combinations hybrids aren't all that rare What I often do is add them to a suitable one of my collections instead But do feel free to bring up unusual subjects or questionable cases in Talk! Thanks for replying to me I did not notice silent edit If you were going to do small trial run with spreadsheets I was planning on outputting it in specific format along with improving tools myself what I do know is that what I cannot get from DYCWMI is timestamp currently today however once I can get character hash it's not too hard to be surprised might as well choose 'notes' to leave something as other attribute column something versatile It might also be good thing to keep columns that are added at a later date in separate tables and in reference form  Alas that was little too far away timestamp 10T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page L1O3b 10T qZ6QG6AUVf 10T 8EbipPoPhE 10T tLKzn BSz 10T BxQMjU99wP 10T hqzROquOji 10T 9T sj fT 10T I8B aJMm 10T 5g JVsO0v 10T dMaORGSEVF 10T ergyoE1d 10T 6 WfDf 10T sz J4GRTD H1O3b 10T 6lM JuHw 10T 8PXINsEGlW 10T i qIFE2LT 10T ttrO ak 10T Bigh Njd 10T A Q9OoV8s 10T bAP npSe 10T BdLsIWIkrZ 10T mAVlqqEnfK 10T jLevyNasU 10T 82BL7EJCJw 10T oIUwNkUNQW 10T tP42ZbJxwl 10T IhbdRR3Qtb 10T vCywMdcyaw 10T tsVFrDRMLj this 10T TmDzttAK same 10T gvy nGUfx same 10T GjSX5q Zx same 10T KHnuCyUP same 10T kaQueZGQTZ 10T qRiPEgJENO 10T OKfZyvgFwj 10T TWUK87S2w 10T NWF PmXEs 10T hmxyM2CMyh 10T r MvEWIJb 10T 8WezmJCFO 10T HJf hoXS 10T KKFYMRHM 10T FFoOHX7odG 10T IyEYxsfFil 10T Q036soLscL 10T RWzEPzcBpE 10T K MwfS3yx  Thank you very much ZngabitanT All my stuff gets backed up to the cloud every day Knowing me I will probably print out the data regularly Any duplicates I come across at the moment are on the individual sim searches I just write the numbers out and write delete next to all but the lowest number I keep all the sim search printouts making a note of the subject used for each search Should I type all these up in a word type document? With regard to the searches at the moment I have had primary secondary tertiary lists I initially looked at the bliplets collection and chose those subjects that look like raindrop I made a list of these subject and used each one at a time for a sim search All new raindrops I wrote next to the original subject until I had gone through that first list I then compiled a secondary list showing both the initial subject used for the search and the secondary subjects to be used for the next searches And so on ad nauseam! Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Now my brain hurts!  So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date?  There are many ways of doing things and many ways of organizing queues whatever works is fine > Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Yes but it's easier to not add them to a collection in the first place if the collection is intended to be representative of the timeline rather than to mark everything that matches its criteria than it is to find and remove them afterwards > So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date? Only if you're interested in the dates and times down to the minutes! I've been doing it especially for Virgo subjects because the Virgo subject numbers are much more scrambled out of chronological order than the LIGO ones Once as we all hope periodic uploads of recently recorded LIGO subjects resume for ER and O subjects coming from the same day will once again get numbers from a limited range and subjects coming from the next day will get higher numbers so the numbers will already provide an approximation to the date time stamps though they'll still be disordered on timescales of minutes and up to a few hours That'll be good enough for many purposes Glitch classes correlating with very bad windy weather will already stand out for example  An afterthought Also once periodic uploads of fresh subjects resume cascaded similarity searches will be less useful for a while than looking at the fresh subjects classifying as far as possible with the available classes while completely new things might be happening! and keeping an eye on what everyone else will be posting in Talk Sim Search isn't clairvoyant it can't yet see glitches that will happen only tomorrow The cascaded approach is more useful for exploring a realm of already uploaded subjects from past eras  I must admit it would be good to get back to some classifying before I completely forget what is what!  Agriculture and landscaping 46Hz around UTC   52Hz Pirate ship 05  41Hz around UTC Cuneiform  05Hz around UTC   41Hz around UTC Slightly cuneiform?  64Hz I expected a much higher frequency around UTC Artefact around 150Hz ? Pirate ship sailing on scattered light?  This dates from between and UTC it's the first subject from Virgo from that hour for which I've seen an approximate timestamp and in frame I spot artefact bands at least at and Hz plus that gradually fading feature near Hz where there ought to be a perfectly stationary never supposed to become visible as a transient spectral line associated with regulating the frequency wavelength of Virgo's main laser I'll bet there's something willow like just over the 2s edge a glitch originating in the laser amplifier and with overtone rich features with msec periodicity just what willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are but it must be either a very peculiar one that hasn't ever come up in a similarity search anchored on another of six hundred odd willows or else it's one that's missing from the Gravity Spy tools database Good catch in any case!  It nice to be back finding things like this again  Hi mitchnanny Regarding ZngabitanT's comment above > Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance While I cannot provide the specific instructions for an iPad as I do not use one here is an outline on how I work with spreadsheet software on a Windows laptop to manage sim searches and collections under study I first sort the sim search results original page by SNR either ascending or descending Then I download the Excel option of the search results as an xlsx file I rename the file with interferometer name era run and seed subject number Then I follow these general steps This is just an overview to give an idea on how I work without describing in detail all actions as you want to keep it simple Using a spreadsheet software I upload the downloaded xlsx file into a new spreadsheet I rename the spreadsheet with interferometer name era run glitch name under study and other information to find it back quickly The uploaded file appears in a new tab a sheet within the spreadsheet automatically formatted with all the columns from the sim search page I rename this tab with the seed subject number I mark the seed subject in the sheet Looking for multiple copies I look at the SNR column where the numbers appear already sorted I paint red those cells along subject number and keep them for future reference I keep the lowest multiple subject number for consistency and paint the cell blue for future reference Now I copy paste one by one the representative subject numbers find their corresponding GS page and see if they fit my collection In this way I can grow representative collections as the multiplicity issue has already been dealt with in the spreadsheet Still a double check is always essential before posting a collection to ensure that there are no multiple copies overlooked somewhere In this way the collection histogram will give a clean representation on glitch density I add an extra column to my sheets where I annotate whether a subject already exists in my collection or was newly added Hence I can pick better new seeds Here is where I discover borderline and possibly new glitches or those intrusively appearing in searches for instance H O Whistle on Blip ssp Trumpetfish For each sim search I also add to the sheet the corresponding histogram as an image insert Then I feed representative subject numbers from my sheet into loops of sim searches For each new search result I proceed as in the steps above download file with SNR already sorted create new sheet tab and name it accordingly look for multiple subject copies retrieve subject page grow collections pick aliens add histogram notes jot down questions and so on Repeat for each sim search performed In the end I ll have a whole spreadsheet file on a given interferometer and particular era or run for a given glitch study containing all the sim searches grouped under seed numbers tabs multiple subjects excluded lowest numbers picked all the subjects that I added to specific collections those discarded borderline and alien ones seeds fed to the ensuing sim searches all the histograms and several notes I create a new spreadsheet file for a new interferometer or a new era run that I want to perform sim searches upon by using the first sim search run then proceed as above So I have one file for each interferometer on a particular era run and also for the other interferometers accordingly I also used the spreadsheets for the Blip ssp Trumpetfish training sets and anything in between that needed to be looked upon A spreadsheet software may offer Insights charts like those I posted in my threads on the Trumpetfish investigation which give additional views and understanding on the data One thing that I found useful during the lengthy glitch investigation is that a spreadsheet gives a compact view of the sim search results without all the scrolling forth and back on the original page Also as I was doing moderate to large sim searches I could manage more than results when needed other times I had to test certain issues with the recommended maximum number of results It also allows for a detailed study of the other parameters while it is easy to sort filter and find values across sheets The spreadsheets helped me to keep a digital and retrievable history of the sim searches and findings seeds multiple subject numbers and lowest numbers picked the evolution of histograms notes and discoveries along the way I continue to use this method in my current investigations of several Blip potential subclasses So all this is just a glimpse on how I juggle sim searches and growing collections in a manageable and trackable way You can add to your sheets any column attribute you might find useful and over time you will feel what works best for you Spreadsheets have myriad functions and actions but you can keep it as simple as necessary to suit your needs Hope it helps it actually goes swiftly with practice There is this Apple tutorial Create a spreadsheet in Numbers on iPad https support apple com guide

The subsequent extremely loud noise associated with the lockloss in S has produced extensive data processing artefacts across the whole minute long data segment from which the spectrograms for these three Hanford subjects were produced The blips in S and in the present S are taller than they look they are half hidden behind the dark artefact bands This is best visible when looking at the fourth frames using the "half moon" button to toggle between normal and inverted colours also helps The relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions the lockloss but provides no further details about what caused it  Thank you Coralbell I will definitely have a few practise spreadsheets I will have to sort out some sort of filing system It is a bit fiddly on the iPad You mention adding the bar graph with the sim searches Does that have to be done via Imgur? I hope the answer is no !  Gladfully no haha! There must be an "Insert image" or similar function on your iPad spreadsheet Simply save the histogram image from GS to your device and then use the spreadsheet function to add it on your sheet  I downloaded the dataset from here BUT I doubt there are some instances in the "Extremely Loud" class that are misclassified ! Example https imgloc com lKYT Is that true? How can we correct those instances? ! Example Alt Text https xyz lKYT png  Thank goodness for that!

Yes instead save the csv and edit it with vi editor Almost years old system and now IBM may helps  Aaaaaargh! I have managed to save a sim search to Numbers plus bar chart but forgot to create a collection I thought I could go back with the back arrow but the collection had different subject numbers I have huge problems creating folders in the right place and I don want hundreds of individual sim searches floating around Just as I think I have created a folder and saved something into it I can find it again Stuff can be saved to the iPad or the cloud but ultimately it all gets backed up to the cloud I have had desktop computers in the past but prefer the iPad for most of my uses I intend to replace it some time and may get an external keyboard If all else fails it back to the cards!!! One more attempt at this wretched bliplets sim search then that it! Definitely a G T evening coming up! Hi Nicm in the VERY dim and distant past when I was working with medical records it was a Linux system so I have at least heard of it!

What happened there is that the immense amount of noise just past the right edge upset the preprocessing whitening algorithm acting on the minute long data segment from which the seconds wide spectrograms were extracted The strain channel was already extremely noisy at time seconds but it then got a whole lot noisier over the next few seconds by several orders of magnitude and the algorithms used at the time reacted by producing very small numbers and very dark spectrogram colors for the seconds window we get to see This was pointed out a while later apropos of a similar subject from the second observing run the first use of the zerosignal hashtag in Gravity Spy Talk one of the comments there provides some further explanation projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 466268?comment Training the Machine Learning to recognize such nearly zero signal spectrograms as originating from events that truly are extremely loud it can't get any worse than the interferometer losing the lock! had been useful at the time even though it looks confusing at first glance to our human eyes Hope this sheds some light on the matter!  O Must resist temptation to mention punched cards on the TR  No access to one that I would be able to use for this That the beauty of the iPad it is always beside me ready for whatever comes next so I really want to make it work for this but it isn easy Mind you I won be doing cascading sim searches for some time yet so I will go back to my old much quicker ways with my bliplets I have learned a lot today and spent hours doing this At least I know I can download an excel file from a sim search to Numbers and add the graph I just mustn forget to create a zoo collection as well Enough!!! Thank you dear mitchnanny I am confident you will find yor way and am so glad again to hear that you learnt this much today  Hmmm it was too difficult to scour usual major giant corporate software instruction manuals and imagine what I needed todo to figure out steps to get necessary files and data together Best help possible for me was to create Linux like batch file assuming I wanted to process some data in shell scripts I was just a kid then as can be imagined in the days before release of Windows we picked it up from junk and built various ecosystems to use up last of computer's life and here we are today What now replaced spreadsheet was direct use of Relational DataBase engine a GNU software suite of traditional SQL language with no additional licensing required for older software manual sheets are still paper based no need to download huge PDFs using a paid internet connection and operating procedures have not changed from then to now This is biggest advantage we can continue to have all users process something in exactly the same way I'm envisioned discussing various glitched data using exactly same results in those ways!

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes!

rectangular time frequency regions between a lower and a higher frequency and between a start and end time and computes the amount of noise or sometimes real GW signal intensity when a GW comes along that's present within each rectangle Any rectangle where the noise level exceeds a predetermined threshold and which are not contained within a larger rectangle that's also noisy above the threshold get called out by Omicron as "triggers" Well it doesn't actually shout of course it writes out a brief description of what it thought it had found to a file This description includes the event time the middle point of the rectangle's extent in time the moment in time that gets mapped to " seconds" in our subject images and the central frequency in Hz the middle of the rectangle in the frequency direction but on a linear scale just taking the average of lower and upper bounding frequency of the rectangle so we know where the rectangle was It includes the width of the rectangle along the time axis as the duration in seconds and the height of the rectangle along the frequency axis as the bandwidth again expressed in Hz Thus central frequency minus half the bandwidth recovers the lower bounding frequency of the rectangle and central frequency plus half the bandwidth gives the upper bounding frequency So we also know how large the rectangle was Blips will often get reported in tall rectangles of short duration "line" glitches in long duration rectangles spanning only a small bandwidth of frequencies But Omicron quite often reports an even larger rectangle for reasons that aren't always obvious Sometimes it's because of additional noise between and kHz that we don't get to see So the reported duration and bandwidth values need to be taken with a grain of salt The preceding do not yet imply anything about the shape and intensity of the glitch contained in the rectangle Imagine a three dimensional model time by frequency by noise intensity where the noise intensity sticks out of the screen Our colour scheme from dark violet to bright yellow is then a measure of how far it sticks out as in a map of a mountain landscape where colours represent altitude The peak frequency is approximately the frequency where the highest peak of this mountain is located where the mountain of noise sticks the most out of the screen But it's not exact it's more like merely naming just the grid square on an Ordnance Survey map inside which the true peak is located That's the "binning" we've been discussing And the snr signal to background noise ratio is a measure of how tall the peak is how far it sticks out of the screen It's useful for finding duplicates because it's computed from the raw data which are never exactly equal for two different glitches in a way that doesn't involve any discrete binning "Tallest peak" means tallest within the particular trigger rectangle that Omicron was reporting not tallest within the whole seconds wide and 2Khz tall region that later gets rendered as a Gravity Spy spectrogram image There may be more than one trigger rectangle within the same spectrogram region and the other glitches may have peaks that are even taller than the glitch around time seconds that was responsible for the trigger Such as the very loud glitch on the left side "stage right" in the Gravity Spy logo image And occasionally we end up with a rather dark area around seconds flanked by bright yellow on both sides Omicron sometimes regards groups of glitchlets as one single glitch that gets reported as one single noisy rectangle and then it's possible for the central time to fall in the middle between two or more glitchlets noise peaks Finally the similarity score does not come from Omicron and is not a property of the single glitch subject it's a measure how closely a subject resembles the given one that was used to start the search means they're the same glitch would be as dissimilar as possible In the DYCWMI tool this column remains empty since it would be meaningless In order for a broadband connection to deliver a high bandwidth in the bytes second sense it needs to use a sufficiently broad range of frequencies for the underlying physical signals on the wire so in that sense it's analogous Hope this helps!

I like the analogy with OS maps and 3D images From my point of view can central frequency and bandwidth along with similarity scores can be disregarded? Sorry I am still confused about peak frequency Is it as I originally thought the frequency of the peak or the frequency of peaks in one second? I have only just realised that individual columns can be sorted I presume only ascending I knew DYCWMI could be sorted I read this in Notes some time ago but stupidly hadn thought to apply it to the normal sim searches It was only in reply to another query that this was mentioned Are there any other tips relating to sim searches? It would be great if the photos of the glitches in the search results were horizontal as in the example rather than vertical Thank you!  Thank you very much for your patient help! The Q transform method based on GWPY seems to have limitations by the way do you know other ways to classify the glitches besides Q transform? When classifying is it usually based on the one dimensional timeseries data or based on the plots based on Q transform? In order Yes that's an example of Omicron having detected additional noise at high frequencies above the Hz top edge of our images in the case of but not in where the central frequency and bandwidth roughly agree with the height of the bliplet but the rectangle is wider than obviously necessary in the latter case the reported duration is seconds enclosing some faint stuff off to the side of the bliplet Probably yes The noisiest frequency the frequency bin where the distribution of noise vs frequency peaks Not the repetition rate of peaks To change from ascending to descending order click a second time on the same column heading The thumbnail pictures were arranged horizontally some years ago until people complained that this took up to much horizontal space and they had to scroll so far sideways to see the numbers Then the arrangement was changed to vertical and we have to scroll a longer way down the page of results Just can't please everyone! On a mobile device like an iPad or using the touchpad on a laptop scrolling horizontally or vertically is equally easy but vertical motions are easier than horizontal ones for people using a mouse with a little scroll wheel so they are better served by the present arrangement  Brilliant! Thank you very much ZngabitanT I must go and try out the sorting ascending and descending!  At the moment while the detection of real gravitational wave signals always relies on the raw timeseries data it has to the Q transform doesn't preserve enough information the classification of individual glitches still relies to a large extent on the Q transform images or even when the observatory operators need a quick overview just on the timestamp peak frequency and SNR without further classification in the form of cluster plots of the bulk distribution E from https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep ! example LIGO glitch cluster plot https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG uploads Screenshotfrom png https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG uploads Screenshotfrom png Virgo uses something similar from https logbook virgo gw eu virgo ?r ! example Virgo glitch cluster plot https logbook virgo gw eu virgo uploads Screenshot 20from png https logbook virgo gw eu virgo uploads Screenshot 20from png The classification by our volunteer community here on Zooniverse relies on everything we can get our hands on spectrogram images metadata accompanying the glitch triggers date time stamp peak frequency SNR and on scrutinizing the observatory logbooks for clues what was going on around the time We can certainly make finer distinctions than we could based on the Q transform images alone For examples see the LIGO projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and Virgo projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposals in our Talk pages On the other hand the detector engineers' analysis of the causes of glitches makes heavy use of the many hundreds of auxiliary data channels recorded alongside the strain channel keeping track of environmental factors seismometers accelerometers microphones magnetometers room temperature and humidity wind and weather data and so forth as well as of many instrumental parameters See our Talk > Help > Resources projects zooniverse gravity spy talk page for links to some relevant papers esp those mentioning "environmental noise" in their titles Gravity Spy projects zooniverse gravity spy talk in preparation will include auxiliary LIGO channels GWitchHunters projects reinforce gwitchhunters already does so for Virgo  thanks! was wondering what was up

Note that this is a discussion forum associated with the Gravity Spy project on Zooniverse the authors of the gwpy software one of the underlying Python modules used by the Gravity Spy software do not participate here But I'll try to provide an answer based on my limited understanding of the topic The current algorithm which maps glitch noise energy levels to colors works roughly as follows It operates on a one minute long data segment at a time which may contain one or more glitch triggers that will be turned into constant Q transform images showing seconds long pieces of the data The one minute time frequency rectangle is subdivided into many small rectangular tiles and the noise energy in each tile is determined The highest noise energy percentile of any tile in the data segment is used to normalize the energies Then the energy levels from representing the lowest the background level to that highest level are mapped logarithmically to a scale from to and the gradations of this level normalized scale are represented by the hues of the colormap The numbers on the colorbar are simply the steps of on this normalized scale the number marks where on the range from to is So the colors in our images do not represent absolute noise energy levels the normalization will be different from one data segment to the next although it will be the same when multiple Gravity Spy subject images are extracted from one and the same data segment And thanks to this dynamic normalization there is not much truncation and thus not much information lost at high noise energy levels Only the very highest energy percentile of the tiles get painted bright yellow Hope this helps!

Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! This is hard to recognize I believe it is an example of a variant of Whistles sometimes tagged drizzle There is a glitch class proposal projects zooniverse gravity spy talk for these under the name Gnarly Whistles Thus they can be classified as None Of The Above while the proposal is being evaluated Thank you for contributing! None Of The Above is always an option when something doesn't want to fit comfortably into the available classes The three main frequencies showing up here are close to those of Violin Mode Harmonics but not quite in the right places Hz is rather low for being a third VM harmonic And any rung up violin modes wouldn't ring down so quickly Something affecting the always present filtering of always present small amounts of noise in the VMH frequency bands might be conceivable The prior "telephone" comments on this subject point towards another possibility alluding to events several months earlier when similar looking glitches at other frequencies had been traced to electronic equipment mobile phones wall phones wireless access points that had accidentally been left behind and left switched on in the vicinity of one of the vacuum chambers hosting the test masses after a routine maintenance visit See g S from 04T UTC one from a short run of several such and a matching entry in the relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep Two days later some WAPs were found plugged in and were unplugged https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep But the shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep around the time of the present subject 14T UTC and the subsequent logbook entries shed no further light on what may have happened on this occasion and there are no other similar subjects from anywhere close in time  Wonderful 3D views Nicm thank you for the hard work!  Hi mitchnanny while it is inevitable to browse collection pages to find a given subject in them with practice you make better guesses and jump pages to look for duplicates simply run the DYCWMI on the collection then sort the SNR column and find such duplicates  Yes but you still need to locate a duplicated subject on its collection page if you want to delete it from the collection It would help if this could be done from the subject's own page through a little button on the collection thumbnail picture and then a popup asking for confirmation to avoid accidental deletions but that remains a Zooniverse functionality desideratum for the future  Yes Thank you Coralbell and ZngabitanT I have used snr to find duplicates and printed out the list so I could peruse at leisure I am resigned to the tedium of finding the correct page I jump several pages until I am in the correct place assuming they are in order  Certainly so I see that I misunderstood the question as just finding duplicates to delete them from a collection one needs to locate them by hand I am also for an easier deletion process from collections  You are welcome mitchnanny tedious it is You may peek at the first and last subject number in a collection page to see the subject number range for that page and keep scrolling if your subject is not within it  pp postpre hybrid Line at Hz   blip subclass blip   23hz  shroud  blip subclass blip   medusa  blip subclass blip   19hz braid   25hz hurdler?

Fireball Virgo O ? Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and good job checking the fourth frame! This is a somewhat curious catch After scratching my head for a while the group at time seconds looks rather too complex to be another simple blip it might be an example of a proposed class of LIGO fireballs So I'd lean towards classifying this as a Blip which happens to have happened less than two seconds after another kind of glitch And indeed it turns out that the present subject is among those which had been used to train the Machine Learning as an example of a Blip You can see that label when you click on the nfo button Only subjects from the ML training set have such labels In the first three workflow levels where the Repeating Blips class is not yet available the alternative would be to call it None Of The Above which ensures that more people are going to get a look and which helps to shift such subjects towards the more advanced workflows offering additional classes But the general rule for combinations of two or more different kinds of glitches is to focus on the one closest to time seconds or dominant at this time provided that it's recognizable and ignore the rest This helps to teach the ML to recognize common glitch types even in crowded surroundings Thank you for contributing! This happened at LIGO Hanford not at Virgo during the third rather than the second observing run so the Virgo O specific glitch class cannot apply but the group as a whole shares some fireballish traits closely but irregularly spaced repetitions of short duration broadband constituent "glitchlets" Possible LIGO analogues of Virgo's fireballs are still being studied and thus not yet available as an official class For the moment I would recommend to call this subject a Koi Fish based on the central feature Please be welcome though to start a collection of subjects reminding you of fireballs! Like some of us have already been doing And or of anything else that looks worth collecting to you  Tips just display DYCWMI collection and assign sequential number g line numbers divide that number by and add that will be pages you want to find  Thank you I will try that out  Yes indeed good point except in cases when the collection contains "zooid does not exist" subjects that don't show up among the DYCWMI output then it'll be slightly off Fortunately that can't happen when a collection has been built up entirely from the results of prior similarity searches  I don know how to add line numbers Maybe I will leave this for now  Perhaps it might be easier on laptop computer open text file with any editor and give it a line number to check ex sort by subject number and then download as csv in Excel worksheet shows header row by default as reference and Linux for me I always check it this way vi " set number" Downloads any csv and see  Thank you Nicm I use an iPad but have Pages I think the time I would need to learn how to do this would be far greater than just going through the pages of my collections but I will bear it in mind  Maybe I could use Numbers on the iPad but I am having a break from that at the moment  I have had a look at Apple Numbers and the lines are already numbered except the is one place too high Presumably you would have to sort by snr first to get the duplicates then sort by subject to get the order that they should theoretically appear in the collection I can see this would be useful for huge collections I really appreciate your help Nicm though at the moment I will stick to the way I know but it has been another useful exercise looking at how I could use Numbers in the future   line Series of 25sb  line  line Another interloper in my bliplet searches 07Hz what sea creature is this?

My only problem was scrolling down to find that page I ended up going up by pages then doing next then another pages or wherever I needed to be and found the correct page I have been able to download the DYCWMI csv file to Numbers and can sort columns Each cell is automatically numbered I have also fished out a wireless keyboard that I have had for years but rarely used Without it I can for example easily scroll to the bottom of a table The learning curve continues!

Faint  line  line low frequency blips Why does the signal bottom right frame disappear when moving to frame 2? Huh that's unusual I had thought that it's too unlikely for different glitches to ever result in the same SNR value but apparently it can occasionally happen Learn something new every day Unrelated remark Seems you have unintentionally had Sim Search create a collection of on the other subject which you may want to delete again has since been deleted again Happens to me too about once a month!  I was drafting a post about identical SNRs for different subjects I came upon them some time ago but had no time till now to look back at those cases into more detail Yes it might be unfortunately more common than expected Will elaborate further when I post  That was a bug in the version of the spectrogram computing software in use at the time late when the Virgo O2a subjects were processed in preparation for uploading them to Zooniverse Back then the 25s window was somewhat incorrectly cut out of the time series of raw data More often this shows up as a dark feature in the bottom right corner of the first frame that has no counterpart in the subsequent frames Here we have a less common example where it has produced a spurious bright blob  Good to hear about the keyboard it will certainly easy things Glad you are managing Numbers better  Thank you I am glad it not me! I will leave both of them in the collection The odds against getting that exact number must be pretty high! Collection deleted I am a bit bogged down with all this today  Let say I am a bit better than I was last time! I used to print my DYCWMI but my bliplets take up pages so I am not wasting that much paper Therefore it had to be Numbers  A few spot checks say that while more common than expected when I expected it to never happen in practice such coincidences are still very rare occurs four times in the whole O data release and I've found some other values which occur two or three times within all of LIGO O The occurrences are widely separated in time glitch classes other metadata values and places of origin one of the four is from Hanford so they can't be mistaken for one another Thus the SNR column still serves for spotting duplicates when they are present we just need to be aware that a repeated value might not necessarily indicate a duplicate subject  Thank you Interesting Aren I lucky to have two in my bliplets collection?!  Thank you for the feedback ZngabitanT If you spotted those instances in the whole O data release it gives an idea of how contained it is for O The SNR column is still very valuable I had spotted occasional instances by opening the subject page for every plicate retrieved in past sim searches but was not sure whether it had been a tool hiccup or a pattern  Hi There are instances where the SNR value from sim search results is identical for different glitches as it would also be the more general case of pointing to multiple identical copies of a single glitch Below is a quartet of results from a Hanford O sim search for seed https www zooniverse org We have four different glitches under the same SNR and the rest of metadata values For SNR https www zooniverse org Sardine https www zooniverse org Elongated Blip https www zooniverse org Trumpetfish https www zooniverse org Whistle Some time ago Hanford O Whistle appeared profusely in sim search results for Blip ssp trumpetfish sardine and similar morphologies I suspect that the tool confusion above for this identical quartet might be caused by a similar sim search bias Regarding collection management I see two scenarios so far on how to practically handle this issue each with their pros and cons Not adding false duplicates to collections Different glitches with identical SNR are left out This would not change the already time consuming cleanup routine involving multiple steps to produce a representative collection Adding false duplicates to collections Different glitches with identical SNR are part of a collection Some subjects being true copies while others false ones would increase the number of routines to produce a representative collection While this might occur sporadically there is an extra aspect to look into for SNR identical values Thank you Related conversation https www zooniverse org where mitchnanny was also experiencing this uncommon issue  it kinda looks like scattered light but if you look at the longer timespan the shape becomes a bit weird idk at first it looks like a low frequency line but lasts way too little to be one very short low frequency line  it looks like a blip and a whistle fused together I'm afraid I can't reproduce this example as described Running a similarity search asking for the maximum number of results ifo H era O starting from and sorting the results on the SNR column returns four occurrences of the SNR value and these are identical quadruplicate copies of a single glitch trigger There are no other LIGO O subjects with this exact SNR value I've checked this in the data release https doi org zenodo have a reported SNR of this value coincidentally occurs once again for one unrelated glitch subject from Livingston O3b has SNR unique among LIGO O subjects has SNR unique among LIGO O subjects has SNR which reoccurs just once in LIGO O for a Livingston O3b subject In any case there is no confusion here on the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search 's part it merely reports the SNR values that had been computed by the Omicron glitch detection software when it was originally triggered and there is no a priori guarantee that the computed values for different glitches must be different This is merely rather unlikely a priori because the values are the outcome of a calculation based on the raw glitch data and not unlike the peak frequencies merely a selection from a predefined list of discrete bins Also the similarity scoring doesn't take the SNR values into account so it cannot be confused by them There's no reason not to include two manifestly different subjects with coinciding SNR values in a collection when both fit the collection criteria in other respects It's only the inclusion of genuinely duplicate subjects coming from one and the same glitch trigger which would bias any conclusions about glitch rates that one may subsequently try to draw from the collection Repeated SNR values in a collection are not themselves an issue checking for repeated SNR values is merely the quickest way I know of for finding any real duplications in a collection  Yes this is a Scattered Light glitch and one of the last of this loud multi arch kind from Hanford By the time it was recorded on a fix had already been applied at Livingston and two days after it was recorded the same fix was rolled out at Hanford too Afterwards the engineers used Gravity Spy data to validate that their fix was as effective as they had hoped! These are quite hard to recognize until one has seen a lot of them actually it's a Crown thus None Of The Above in levels but processed with unusually fine frequency resolution at the expense of unusually coarse time resolution  This subject will fit into a proposed new glitch class of Coronets projects zooniverse gravity spy talk "little crowns" They first showed up in large numbers in mid January sharing the fast pacing of Crowns but staying confined to a narrow frequency band around Hz  Interesting catch! It's primarily a Whistle and yes it is fused with something I can't quite tell what that something might be but it seems to affect only frequencies below about Hz everything higher up is part of the Whistle  Sounds good thank you for letting me know! Thank you for the explanations This is puzzling as I got my identical quadruplicate false copies with SNR for a search on results on Han O with said seed This same search also yielded an additional two pairs of different subjects with identical SNR For SNR like your Han and Liv above https www zooniverse org https www zooniverse org and For SNR https www zooniverse org https www zooniverse org See below a snippet showing these cases from the spreadsheet downloaded from the sim search already sorted by SNR I added an empty line between the instances ! False duplicates https imgur com MaejBye jpg https imgur com MaejBye jpg It is also surprising that in one search three instances of false duplicates appeared I am travelling tomorrow but I shall keep looking into this because the discrepancies are strange Any ideas?

    Also, importantly, we already know about several glitch classes. So if you see these, they are not new:
    - 1080 Line 
    - 1400 Ripple 
    - 70 Hz Line 
    - Air Compressor (50 Hz)
    - Blip 
    - Chirp 
    - Crown 
    - Extremely Loud 
    - Helix 
    - Koi Fish 
    - Low-Frequency Line 
    - No Glitch 
    - Paired Doves 
    - Pizzicato 
    - Power Line (60 Hz) 
    - Repeating Blips 
    - Scattered Light 
    - Scratchy 
    - Tomte 
    - Uncategorized_Glitches 
    - Violin Mode Harmonic 
    - Wandering Line 
    - Whistle 
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

This new category recognizes variations in the appearance and frequency distribution from the known Crown glitches.\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - Concerns in Talk Dataset 2 revolve around the adequacy of current classifications to address newly observed phenomena, particularly with the evolving nature of glitches as sensor technology and environmental factors change. For instance, there are discussions about the potential need for a Virgo-specific subclassification due to unique glitch characteristics observed that differ from LIGO\'s glitches.\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - There are technical inquiries about the methods used to classify glitches, specifically questioning the reliability of classifying based solely on 2D images and concerns about the loss of information when colorbars in the GWpy tool are cut, which could lead to misclassifications or overlooking subtle glitch details.\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins:**\n   - One hypothesis discussed in Talk Dataset 2 is the environmental impact on glitch occurrences, such as natural vibrations or electronic devices accidentally left on near sensors, affecting data. For example, the hypothesis that mobile phones left on near vacuum chambers could introduce electronic interference, resembling certain glitch patterns.\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are detailed discussions about the effects of specific sensors or channels on glitch appearances. Questions are raised about why certain glitches appear predominantly in data from one observatory and not others, suggesting a deeper dive into the sensor-specific or environmental conditions affecting data collection.\n\n6. **Overall Observations and Trends:**\n   - Talk Dataset 2 shows a more sophisticated level of engagement from citizen scientists, with a focus on refining glitch classifications and understanding the underlying reasons for their occurrences. There is also a notable trend towards questioning and verifying the technical processes used in data analysis and glitch classification, reflecting a maturation in the citizen scientists’ approach to gravitational wave data analysis.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1714008616, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_76f018034d', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=453, prompt_tokens=31262, total_tokens=31715))

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk Dataset 1:

I have learned a lesson the hard way index cards are not the best way to record a collection! When I first started my Livingston bliplets collection I had no idea how many there would be Subsequent collections have added to the masses of index cards Now I need a new plan Hence I have been trying to learn how to use the Numbers spreadsheet app on the iPad I wanted to be able to write columns of subject numbers in any order and be able to sort them in ascending order My only experience of using a spreadsheet programme was on a very short course about years ago I have never needed to use that now mostly forgotten information Until now! My question to ZngabitanT is this what column headings do I really need to include? So far I have decided on Date ie the date I logged the subject in my notebook or the date of a sim search Subject number Peak frequency Q How was the subject detected via sim search Done and Talk or by my own classifying Subject number used if a sim search was done Finder of that subject who posted it in Done and Talk in Notes I have had a very short trial run with one of my small collections I have not included the date of the glitch as it isn known without individual sim searches Also other information eg snr can be obtained from DYCWMI What have I missed? I would like to keep it as simple as possible It will probably take me as long to type in as it does writing the cards but far less space take up in boxes around the house I am anticipating that we may be starting new collections in O so there is no hurry for this information just yet Thank you!

Your list of columns looks good for starters I can think of one more thing I'm afraid will also be necessary a way to keep track of "subject X is a duplicate of subject Y" I'll be pleasantly surprised if we don't encounter some amount of duplication among subjects to be uploaded to Gravity Spy in the future And when multiple identical subjects are similar but not identical to a given one there's no guarantee that similarity search will return all of them nor that the lowest numbered subject will be among those returned The full set of duplicates will only be guaranteed to show up when we run a sim search from one of them and ask for sufficiently many results Some other points also for the benefit of future readers Be sure that you have a way to go back to yesterday's version of a spreadsheet when today's has accidentally got mangled or lost Make backups and verify that you can restore from a backup Cloud storage may be suitable here Objectives may expand there's no foretelling what new weird and wonderful glitches are going to show up during O Experiment with a small toy spreadsheet Can you add another column as an afterthought without breaking anything you were able to do with it before adding the column? An additional column won't need to be fully populated immediately for all the subject rows already in the spreadsheet there'll be plenty of further subjects added later and missing information about earlier subjects can be filled in occasionally General criteria for deciding what to include Anything you want to be able to search for g the subject number in case it comes up again anything you want to be able to sort by anything you want to be able to filter on in particular an indication whether the subject is "done" or still in your "to do" queue whether or not you have already fed it back to a similarity search Any column that changes from empty to non empty when you use a subject for a fresh search would suffice or you could use a marker for "to do" items and remove it when "done" and then anything you want to have at your fingertips without having to load the Zooniverse subject page anew or to run the collection through DYCWMI g Q value contributors who had brought up the subject in Talk or previously collected it peak frequency A column identifying the interferometer won't be needed when you plan on keeping separate spreadsheets for each site which has some advantages for all their similarities Hanford and Livingston have never had exactly the same glitch mix I've been mostly interested in bringing subjects into chronological order so for me the date time stamps when the subject was triggered were the first thing I started tracking after the subject numbers Other stuff Q value peak frequency SNR contributors free text annotations got added to my lists over the years as the need arose Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance I've also been keeping track of "zooid does not exist" cases subjects that had never made it into the Gravity Spy tools database You may not have a need for this such subjects can't come up among the results of similarity searches  Neither what I see here is a superposition blend of two probably unrelated glitches Like the Livingston tea light projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches are but this here is not a proper tea light either The peak frequency is reported as Hz so the dominant glitch is the loud triangular borderline between Tomte and Koi thing between about and Hz A Blip subclass varnish run glitch happened a few milliseconds earlier reaching down from the top to about Hz though not bright yellow all the way to the top thus a borderline member of this putative subclass But it's neither quite central nor the dominant feature  Yes we've had some of these occasionally during the third observing run Their first frames can look confusingly similar to those of Hz Line glitches But the latter never come in such wavy arrangements they happened once every minutes while they were happening during a brief period in April only  It's generally not necessary to annotate the obvious Gravity Spy is a bit too large for that with nearly two million active subjects and chance combinations hybrids aren't all that rare What I often do is add them to a suitable one of my collections instead But do feel free to bring up unusual subjects or questionable cases in Talk! Thanks for replying to me I did not notice silent edit If you were going to do small trial run with spreadsheets I was planning on outputting it in specific format along with improving tools myself what I do know is that what I cannot get from DYCWMI is timestamp currently today however once I can get character hash it's not too hard to be surprised might as well choose 'notes' to leave something as other attribute column something versatile It might also be good thing to keep columns that are added at a later date in separate tables and in reference form  Alas that was little too far away timestamp 10T near time subject according to I own RDB projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2459487?comment page L1O3b 10T qZ6QG6AUVf 10T 8EbipPoPhE 10T tLKzn BSz 10T BxQMjU99wP 10T hqzROquOji 10T 9T sj fT 10T I8B aJMm 10T 5g JVsO0v 10T dMaORGSEVF 10T ergyoE1d 10T 6 WfDf 10T sz J4GRTD H1O3b 10T 6lM JuHw 10T 8PXINsEGlW 10T i qIFE2LT 10T ttrO ak 10T Bigh Njd 10T A Q9OoV8s 10T bAP npSe 10T BdLsIWIkrZ 10T mAVlqqEnfK 10T jLevyNasU 10T 82BL7EJCJw 10T oIUwNkUNQW 10T tP42ZbJxwl 10T IhbdRR3Qtb 10T vCywMdcyaw 10T tsVFrDRMLj this 10T TmDzttAK same 10T gvy nGUfx same 10T GjSX5q Zx same 10T KHnuCyUP same 10T kaQueZGQTZ 10T qRiPEgJENO 10T OKfZyvgFwj 10T TWUK87S2w 10T NWF PmXEs 10T hmxyM2CMyh 10T r MvEWIJb 10T 8WezmJCFO 10T HJf hoXS 10T KKFYMRHM 10T FFoOHX7odG 10T IyEYxsfFil 10T Q036soLscL 10T RWzEPzcBpE 10T K MwfS3yx  Thank you very much ZngabitanT All my stuff gets backed up to the cloud every day Knowing me I will probably print out the data regularly Any duplicates I come across at the moment are on the individual sim searches I just write the numbers out and write delete next to all but the lowest number I keep all the sim search printouts making a note of the subject used for each search Should I type all these up in a word type document? With regard to the searches at the moment I have had primary secondary tertiary lists I initially looked at the bliplets collection and chose those subjects that look like raindrop I made a list of these subject and used each one at a time for a sim search All new raindrops I wrote next to the original subject until I had gone through that first list I then compiled a secondary list showing both the initial subject used for the search and the secondary subjects to be used for the next searches And so on ad nauseam! Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Now my brain hurts!  So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date?  There are many ways of doing things and many ways of organizing queues whatever works is fine > Can we just get duplicates from DYCWMI looking at snr? Yes but it's easier to not add them to a collection in the first place if the collection is intended to be representative of the timeline rather than to mark everything that matches its criteria than it is to find and remove them afterwards > So should I be taking each new subject found in a sim search and doing another sim search to find the date? Only if you're interested in the dates and times down to the minutes! I've been doing it especially for Virgo subjects because the Virgo subject numbers are much more scrambled out of chronological order than the LIGO ones Once as we all hope periodic uploads of recently recorded LIGO subjects resume for ER and O subjects coming from the same day will once again get numbers from a limited range and subjects coming from the next day will get higher numbers so the numbers will already provide an approximation to the date time stamps though they'll still be disordered on timescales of minutes and up to a few hours That'll be good enough for many purposes Glitch classes correlating with very bad windy weather will already stand out for example  An afterthought Also once periodic uploads of fresh subjects resume cascaded similarity searches will be less useful for a while than looking at the fresh subjects classifying as far as possible with the available classes while completely new things might be happening! and keeping an eye on what everyone else will be posting in Talk Sim Search isn't clairvoyant it can't yet see glitches that will happen only tomorrow The cascaded approach is more useful for exploring a realm of already uploaded subjects from past eras  I must admit it would be good to get back to some classifying before I completely forget what is what!  Agriculture and landscaping 46Hz around UTC   52Hz Pirate ship 05  41Hz around UTC Cuneiform  05Hz around UTC   41Hz around UTC Slightly cuneiform?  64Hz I expected a much higher frequency around UTC Artefact around 150Hz ? Pirate ship sailing on scattered light?  This dates from between and UTC it's the first subject from Virgo from that hour for which I've seen an approximate timestamp and in frame I spot artefact bands at least at and Hz plus that gradually fading feature near Hz where there ought to be a perfectly stationary never supposed to become visible as a transient spectral line associated with regulating the frequency wavelength of Virgo's main laser I'll bet there's something willow like just over the 2s edge a glitch originating in the laser amplifier and with overtone rich features with msec periodicity just what willows projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are but it must be either a very peculiar one that hasn't ever come up in a similarity search anchored on another of six hundred odd willows or else it's one that's missing from the Gravity Spy tools database Good catch in any case!  It nice to be back finding things like this again  Hi mitchnanny Regarding ZngabitanT's comment above > Personally I'm not using spreadsheet software for this I know that Coralbell does though who may be able to provide some additional guidance While I cannot provide the specific instructions for an iPad as I do not use one here is an outline on how I work with spreadsheet software on a Windows laptop to manage sim searches and collections under study I first sort the sim search results original page by SNR either ascending or descending Then I download the Excel option of the search results as an xlsx file I rename the file with interferometer name era run and seed subject number Then I follow these general steps This is just an overview to give an idea on how I work without describing in detail all actions as you want to keep it simple Using a spreadsheet software I upload the downloaded xlsx file into a new spreadsheet I rename the spreadsheet with interferometer name era run glitch name under study and other information to find it back quickly The uploaded file appears in a new tab a sheet within the spreadsheet automatically formatted with all the columns from the sim search page I rename this tab with the seed subject number I mark the seed subject in the sheet Looking for multiple copies I look at the SNR column where the numbers appear already sorted I paint red those cells along subject number and keep them for future reference I keep the lowest multiple subject number for consistency and paint the cell blue for future reference Now I copy paste one by one the representative subject numbers find their corresponding GS page and see if they fit my collection In this way I can grow representative collections as the multiplicity issue has already been dealt with in the spreadsheet Still a double check is always essential before posting a collection to ensure that there are no multiple copies overlooked somewhere In this way the collection histogram will give a clean representation on glitch density I add an extra column to my sheets where I annotate whether a subject already exists in my collection or was newly added Hence I can pick better new seeds Here is where I discover borderline and possibly new glitches or those intrusively appearing in searches for instance H O Whistle on Blip ssp Trumpetfish For each sim search I also add to the sheet the corresponding histogram as an image insert Then I feed representative subject numbers from my sheet into loops of sim searches For each new search result I proceed as in the steps above download file with SNR already sorted create new sheet tab and name it accordingly look for multiple subject copies retrieve subject page grow collections pick aliens add histogram notes jot down questions and so on Repeat for each sim search performed In the end I ll have a whole spreadsheet file on a given interferometer and particular era or run for a given glitch study containing all the sim searches grouped under seed numbers tabs multiple subjects excluded lowest numbers picked all the subjects that I added to specific collections those discarded borderline and alien ones seeds fed to the ensuing sim searches all the histograms and several notes I create a new spreadsheet file for a new interferometer or a new era run that I want to perform sim searches upon by using the first sim search run then proceed as above So I have one file for each interferometer on a particular era run and also for the other interferometers accordingly I also used the spreadsheets for the Blip ssp Trumpetfish training sets and anything in between that needed to be looked upon A spreadsheet software may offer Insights charts like those I posted in my threads on the Trumpetfish investigation which give additional views and understanding on the data One thing that I found useful during the lengthy glitch investigation is that a spreadsheet gives a compact view of the sim search results without all the scrolling forth and back on the original page Also as I was doing moderate to large sim searches I could manage more than results when needed other times I had to test certain issues with the recommended maximum number of results It also allows for a detailed study of the other parameters while it is easy to sort filter and find values across sheets The spreadsheets helped me to keep a digital and retrievable history of the sim searches and findings seeds multiple subject numbers and lowest numbers picked the evolution of histograms notes and discoveries along the way I continue to use this method in my current investigations of several Blip potential subclasses So all this is just a glimpse on how I juggle sim searches and growing collections in a manageable and trackable way You can add to your sheets any column attribute you might find useful and over time you will feel what works best for you Spreadsheets have myriad functions and actions but you can keep it as simple as necessary to suit your needs Hope it helps it actually goes swiftly with practice There is this Apple tutorial Create a spreadsheet in Numbers on iPad https support apple com guide

Also I was able to download the excel file I normally just view then print to work on the search results and save it to Numbers It a start I have a long way to go but I am extremely grateful for what I have just learned from you It all a huge learning curve for me Thank you  Good morning mitchnanny glad to hear so I know you will be able to take what you need from my explanation and start your learning curve Take a look at the Apple tutorial I referenced above their guides use screenshots and it seems well explained While office management software has evolved much in the past decades they still keep the basic functions Regards You mean the image for the second frame was incomplete when it got shown to you? That could happen fortunately very rarely when the image file transmission from the Zooniverse cloud servers to your browser got stuck or got disrupted for some reason The file itself is OK showing a normal image to me now  This is Scattered Light la Virgo O Only the tops of the arches are bright enough to show up well and here the high Q processing has further stretched them horizontally and further subdued the flanks But the overall arrangement is characteristic  I'm not quite sure what it is either It could be a high Q rendering of an HFB or somewhat less likely an isolated brighter spot in a very faint whistle Calling it NOTA when neither option looks convincing is a safe alternative  There is a proposed glitch class for this whistle variant Gnarly Whistle projects zooniverse gravity spy talk so they can also be classified as None Of The Above while the proposal is pending For once the nickname had been given by the LIGO engineers themselves not by our volunteer community  Wonderful mitchnanny I am so happy that I could be of help and yours is a great starting point Allow me to suggest a learning approach You may resume re learning spreadsheets by creating yourself a simple file with just two or three columns in a tab filled with some words and numbers Then practise adding removing sorting searching renaming painting all the basic actions Then add another tab fill it in and try searching the whole spreadsheet for a number or word Then continue with very small sim searches results downloaded so that you feel in control of the sheet while mastering already the basic functions One step at a time my friend! The subsequent extremely loud noise associated with the lockloss in S has produced extensive data processing artefacts across the whole minute long data segment from which the spectrograms for these three Hanford subjects were produced The blips in S and in the present S are taller than they look they are half hidden behind the dark artefact bands This is best visible when looking at the fourth frames using the "half moon" button to toggle between normal and inverted colours also helps The relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep mentions the lockloss but provides no further details about what caused it  Thank you Coralbell I will definitely have a few practise spreadsheets I will have to sort out some sort of filing system It is a bit fiddly on the iPad You mention adding the bar graph with the sim searches Does that have to be done via Imgur? I hope the answer is no !  Gladfully no haha! There must be an "Insert image" or similar function on your iPad spreadsheet Simply save the histogram image from GS to your device and then use the spreadsheet function to add it on your sheet  I downloaded the dataset from here BUT I doubt there are some instances in the "Extremely Loud" class that are misclassified !

I have managed to save a sim search to Numbers plus bar chart but forgot to create a collection I thought I could go back with the back arrow but the collection had different subject numbers I have huge problems creating folders in the right place and I don want hundreds of individual sim searches floating around Just as I think I have created a folder and saved something into it I can find it again Stuff can be saved to the iPad or the cloud but ultimately it all gets backed up to the cloud I have had desktop computers in the past but prefer the iPad for most of my uses I intend to replace it some time and may get an external keyboard If all else fails it back to the cards!!! One more attempt at this wretched bliplets sim search then that it! Definitely a G T evening coming up! Hi Nicm in the VERY dim and distant past when I was working with medical records it was a Linux system so I have at least heard of it! I didn do anything with the system itself can you imagine the chaos!

What happened there is that the immense amount of noise just past the right edge upset the preprocessing whitening algorithm acting on the minute long data segment from which the seconds wide spectrograms were extracted The strain channel was already extremely noisy at time seconds but it then got a whole lot noisier over the next few seconds by several orders of magnitude and the algorithms used at the time reacted by producing very small numbers and very dark spectrogram colors for the seconds window we get to see This was pointed out a while later apropos of a similar subject from the second observing run the first use of the zerosignal hashtag in Gravity Spy Talk one of the comments there provides some further explanation projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 466268?comment Training the Machine Learning to recognize such nearly zero signal spectrograms as originating from events that truly are extremely loud it can't get any worse than the interferometer losing the lock! had been useful at the time even though it looks confusing at first glance to our human eyes Hope this sheds some light on the matter!  O Must resist temptation to mention punched cards on the TR  No access to one that I would be able to use for this That the beauty of the iPad it is always beside me ready for whatever comes next so I really want to make it work for this but it isn easy Mind you I won be doing cascading sim searches for some time yet so I will go back to my old much quicker ways with my bliplets I have learned a lot today and spent hours doing this At least I know I can download an excel file from a sim search to Numbers and add the graph I just mustn forget to create a zoo collection as well Enough!!! Thank you dear mitchnanny I am confident you will find yor way and am so glad again to hear that you learnt this much today  Hmmm it was too difficult to scour usual major giant corporate software instruction manuals and imagine what I needed todo to figure out steps to get necessary files and data together Best help possible for me was to create Linux like batch file assuming I wanted to process some data in shell scripts I was just a kid then as can be imagined in the days before release of Windows we picked it up from junk and built various ecosystems to use up last of computer's life and here we are today What now replaced spreadsheet was direct use of Relational DataBase engine a GNU software suite of traditional SQL language with no additional licensing required for older software manual sheets are still paper based no need to download huge PDFs using a paid internet connection and operating procedures have not changed from then to now This is biggest advantage we can continue to have all users process something in exactly the same way I'm envisioned discussing various glitched data using exactly same results in those ways!

The page at https zenodo org record points to a newer version at https zenodo org record but the trainingset d tar gz files linked from both pages are the same as are the CSV files with the metadata trainingset d metadata csv Only the linked HD files are different So you are looking at the most up to date public version of the training set from late And if I am not mistaken the all very dark subjects with Extremely Loud labels hadn't been included in the original version from they must have been intentionally added in when it became clear that they are a symptom of lockloss events Gravity Spy exists as a Zooniverse project precisely because the machine learning classifications by convolutional neural networks aren't perfect We have learnt a lot more about gravitational wave interferometer glitches over the last five years One of the lessons is that there exist whole glitch classes which can be recognized only by taking additional metadata into account such as peak frequencies and SNRs and the date time stamps when they happened the sceconds wide spectrogram images alone do not suffice and therefore machine learning based only on CNNs using these images won't suffice for them There have been glitches which last more than ten seconds and glitches which characteristically repeated on time scales of a few minutes There have been glitch triggers where the glitch detection software shouldn't have triggered in the first place caused by a combination of loud stationary noise and insufficient attention to the edges of consecutive overlapping data segments Moreover research into incorporating auxiliary data channels into the combined machine learning and citizen science toolkit has started only relatively recently So the existing training sets are a starting point but with room for further ongoing and future enhancements! Remember to add it to your collection projects zooniverse gravity spy collections adodgen borderline varnish run blip of same!  OK Thanks for your help!  I have just realized that I had misunderstood Coralbell's intentions in bringing up droplets as a putative Blip subclass distinct from sardine projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and in fact her prototype droplet doesn't reside in the Hz peak frequency band it's in the Hz band where the sardines live So I'm going to leave the droplets to her and change my nomenclature and trawl for another nickname for the next lower frequency band stuff after sardines Another kind of fish somewhat heavier than sardines Henceforth I'll be thinking of small blips in the Hz peak frequency region as mackerel One example of these is S fish fish fish  I tried unsuccessfully to hide columns in Numbers I may have to consider other app options in the future but at the moment it will have to do I am also not familiar at all with the way you use your spreadsheets working from multiple sheets of numerical information Coralbell I have no background in this and I think the learning curve may be too steep for the time I am able to spend on it However I have learned some really useful things especially sorting the columns in sim searches! Duh I have been doing this for getting on for years now and only just found this out!  Huh there are even weirder things I just stumbled upon YjmmECWODq S also linked above among the results of a Similarity Search anchored on one old blip from Livingston O I wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't brought up this topic yesterday but this too is a member of the training set and the glitch class label from the metadata can also be seen when we click on the nfo button under the subject image It's a Blip The other metadata make it clear that it really was triggered by a short duration broadband glitch at GPS time 04T UTC The spectrogram images have suffered the same fate as the all very dark ones discussed above LLO lost lock at circa https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and the excess noise immediately before the lockloss must have been loud enough to spoil the preprocessing whitening step resulting in all zeroes for the normalized energy frame here is really completely and uniformly dark So this is a Blip but we can't see it in the images and there was a lockloss shortly afterwards but the lockloss wasn't what had triggered this glitch detection Thus the classification is correct but the four image frames processed using the old version of the algorithms aren't really useful for training a ConvNN except for preventing overtraining by telling the ConvNN that "such an all dark set of images might nevertheless come from a Blip" And quite surprisingly the separate ConvNN that had been used for populating the Similarity Search tool's database did draw the right conclusion grouping this with other Blips  To hide columns see the iPad guide paragraph Hide or Show Rows and Columns https support apple com guide numbers ipad add or remove rows and columns ta a ipados Just take it at your own pace Once again I am so glad that you can now sort those columns and do some spreadsheet editing  Aha yes!

rectangular time frequency regions between a lower and a higher frequency and between a start and end time and computes the amount of noise or sometimes real GW signal intensity when a GW comes along that's present within each rectangle Any rectangle where the noise level exceeds a predetermined threshold and which are not contained within a larger rectangle that's also noisy above the threshold get called out by Omicron as "triggers" Well it doesn't actually shout of course it writes out a brief description of what it thought it had found to a file This description includes the event time the middle point of the rectangle's extent in time the moment in time that gets mapped to " seconds" in our subject images and the central frequency in Hz the middle of the rectangle in the frequency direction but on a linear scale just taking the average of lower and upper bounding frequency of the rectangle so we know where the rectangle was It includes the width of the rectangle along the time axis as the duration in seconds and the height of the rectangle along the frequency axis as the bandwidth again expressed in Hz Thus central frequency minus half the bandwidth recovers the lower bounding frequency of the rectangle and central frequency plus half the bandwidth gives the upper bounding frequency So we also know how large the rectangle was Blips will often get reported in tall rectangles of short duration "line" glitches in long duration rectangles spanning only a small bandwidth of frequencies But Omicron quite often reports an even larger rectangle for reasons that aren't always obvious Sometimes it's because of additional noise between and kHz that we don't get to see So the reported duration and bandwidth values need to be taken with a grain of salt The preceding do not yet imply anything about the shape and intensity of the glitch contained in the rectangle Imagine a three dimensional model time by frequency by noise intensity where the noise intensity sticks out of the screen Our colour scheme from dark violet to bright yellow is then a measure of how far it sticks out as in a map of a mountain landscape where colours represent altitude The peak frequency is approximately the frequency where the highest peak of this mountain is located where the mountain of noise sticks the most out of the screen But it's not exact it's more like merely naming just the grid square on an Ordnance Survey map inside which the true peak is located That's the "binning" we've been discussing And the snr signal to background noise ratio is a measure of how tall the peak is how far it sticks out of the screen It's useful for finding duplicates because it's computed from the raw data which are never exactly equal for two different glitches in a way that doesn't involve any discrete binning "Tallest peak" means tallest within the particular trigger rectangle that Omicron was reporting not tallest within the whole seconds wide and 2Khz tall region that later gets rendered as a Gravity Spy spectrogram image There may be more than one trigger rectangle within the same spectrogram region and the other glitches may have peaks that are even taller than the glitch around time seconds that was responsible for the trigger Such as the very loud glitch on the left side "stage right" in the Gravity Spy logo image And occasionally we end up with a rather dark area around seconds flanked by bright yellow on both sides Omicron sometimes regards groups of glitchlets as one single glitch that gets reported as one single noisy rectangle and then it's possible for the central time to fall in the middle between two or more glitchlets noise peaks Finally the similarity score does not come from Omicron and is not a property of the single glitch subject it's a measure how closely a subject resembles the given one that was used to start the search means they're the same glitch would be as dissimilar as possible In the DYCWMI tool this column remains empty since it would be meaningless In order for a broadband connection to deliver a high bandwidth in the bytes second sense it needs to use a sufficiently broad range of frequencies for the underlying physical signals on the wire so in that sense it's analogous Hope this helps!

I like the analogy with OS maps and 3D images From my point of view can central frequency and bandwidth along with similarity scores can be disregarded? Sorry I am still confused about peak frequency Is it as I originally thought the frequency of the peak or the frequency of peaks in one second? I have only just realised that individual columns can be sorted I presume only ascending I knew DYCWMI could be sorted I read this in Notes some time ago but stupidly hadn thought to apply it to the normal sim searches It was only in reply to another query that this was mentioned Are there any other tips relating to sim searches? It would be great if the photos of the glitches in the search results were horizontal as in the example rather than vertical Thank you!  Thank you very much for your patient help! The Q transform method based on GWPY seems to have limitations by the way do you know other ways to classify the glitches besides Q transform? When classifying is it usually based on the one dimensional timeseries data or based on the plots based on Q transform? In order Yes that's an example of Omicron having detected additional noise at high frequencies above the Hz top edge of our images in the case of but not in where the central frequency and bandwidth roughly agree with the height of the bliplet but the rectangle is wider than obviously necessary in the latter case the reported duration is seconds enclosing some faint stuff off to the side of the bliplet Probably yes The noisiest frequency the frequency bin where the distribution of noise vs frequency peaks Not the repetition rate of peaks To change from ascending to descending order click a second time on the same column heading The thumbnail pictures were arranged horizontally some years ago until people complained that this took up to much horizontal space and they had to scroll so far sideways to see the numbers Then the arrangement was changed to vertical and we have to scroll a longer way down the page of results Just can't please everyone! On a mobile device like an iPad or using the touchpad on a laptop scrolling horizontally or vertically is equally easy but vertical motions are easier than horizontal ones for people using a mouse with a little scroll wheel so they are better served by the present arrangement  Brilliant! Thank you very much ZngabitanT I must go and try out the sorting ascending and descending!  At the moment while the detection of real gravitational wave signals always relies on the raw timeseries data it has to the Q transform doesn't preserve enough information the classification of individual glitches still relies to a large extent on the Q transform images or even when the observatory operators need a quick overview just on the timestamp peak frequency and SNR without further classification in the form of cluster plots of the bulk distribution E from https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep ! example LIGO glitch cluster plot https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG uploads Screenshotfrom png https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG uploads Screenshotfrom png Virgo uses something similar from https logbook virgo gw eu virgo ?r ! example Virgo glitch cluster plot https logbook virgo gw eu virgo uploads Screenshot 20from png https logbook virgo gw eu virgo uploads Screenshot 20from png The classification by our volunteer community here on Zooniverse relies on everything we can get our hands on spectrogram images metadata accompanying the glitch triggers date time stamp peak frequency SNR and on scrutinizing the observatory logbooks for clues what was going on around the time We can certainly make finer distinctions than we could based on the Q transform images alone For examples see the LIGO projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and Virgo projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitch class proposals in our Talk pages On the other hand the detector engineers' analysis of the causes of glitches makes heavy use of the many hundreds of auxiliary data channels recorded alongside the strain channel keeping track of environmental factors seismometers accelerometers microphones magnetometers room temperature and humidity wind and weather data and so forth as well as of many instrumental parameters See our Talk > Help > Resources projects zooniverse gravity spy talk page for links to some relevant papers esp those mentioning "environmental noise" in their titles Gravity Spy projects zooniverse gravity spy talk in preparation will include auxiliary LIGO channels GWitchHunters projects reinforce gwitchhunters already does so for Virgo  thanks! was wondering what was up

Note that this is a discussion forum associated with the Gravity Spy project on Zooniverse the authors of the gwpy software one of the underlying Python modules used by the Gravity Spy software do not participate here But I'll try to provide an answer based on my limited understanding of the topic The current algorithm which maps glitch noise energy levels to colors works roughly as follows It operates on a one minute long data segment at a time which may contain one or more glitch triggers that will be turned into constant Q transform images showing seconds long pieces of the data The one minute time frequency rectangle is subdivided into many small rectangular tiles and the noise energy in each tile is determined The highest noise energy percentile of any tile in the data segment is used to normalize the energies Then the energy levels from representing the lowest the background level to that highest level are mapped logarithmically to a scale from to and the gradations of this level normalized scale are represented by the hues of the colormap The numbers on the colorbar are simply the steps of on this normalized scale the number marks where on the range from to is So the colors in our images do not represent absolute noise energy levels the normalization will be different from one data segment to the next although it will be the same when multiple Gravity Spy subject images are extracted from one and the same data segment And thanks to this dynamic normalization there is not much truncation and thus not much information lost at high noise energy levels Only the very highest energy percentile of the tiles get painted bright yellow Hope this helps!

Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! This is hard to recognize I believe it is an example of a variant of Whistles sometimes tagged drizzle There is a glitch class proposal projects zooniverse gravity spy talk for these under the name Gnarly Whistles Thus they can be classified as None Of The Above while the proposal is being evaluated Thank you for contributing! None Of The Above is always an option when something doesn't want to fit comfortably into the available classes The three main frequencies showing up here are close to those of Violin Mode Harmonics but not quite in the right places Hz is rather low for being a third VM harmonic And any rung up violin modes wouldn't ring down so quickly Something affecting the always present filtering of always present small amounts of noise in the VMH frequency bands might be conceivable The prior "telephone" comments on this subject point towards another possibility alluding to events several months earlier when similar looking glitches at other frequencies had been traced to electronic equipment mobile phones wall phones wireless access points that had accidentally been left behind and left switched on in the vicinity of one of the vacuum chambers hosting the test masses after a routine maintenance visit See g S from 04T UTC one from a short run of several such and a matching entry in the relevant shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep Two days later some WAPs were found plugged in and were unplugged https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep But the shift report https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep around the time of the present subject 14T UTC and the subsequent logbook entries shed no further light on what may have happened on this occasion and there are no other similar subjects from anywhere close in time  Wonderful 3D views Nicm thank you for the hard work!  Hi mitchnanny while it is inevitable to browse collection pages to find a given subject in them with practice you make better guesses and jump pages to look for duplicates simply run the DYCWMI on the collection then sort the SNR column and find such duplicates  Yes but you still need to locate a duplicated subject on its collection page if you want to delete it from the collection It would help if this could be done from the subject's own page through a little button on the collection thumbnail picture and then a popup asking for confirmation to avoid accidental deletions but that remains a Zooniverse functionality desideratum for the future  Yes Thank you Coralbell and ZngabitanT I have used snr to find duplicates and printed out the list so I could peruse at leisure I am resigned to the tedium of finding the correct page I jump several pages until I am in the correct place assuming they are in order  Certainly so I see that I misunderstood the question as just finding duplicates to delete them from a collection one needs to locate them by hand I am also for an easier deletion process from collections  You are welcome mitchnanny tedious it is You may peek at the first and last subject number in a collection page to see the subject number range for that page and keep scrolling if your subject is not within it  pp postpre hybrid Line at Hz   blip subclass blip   23hz  shroud  blip subclass blip   medusa  blip subclass blip   19hz braid   25hz hurdler?

Fireball Virgo O ? Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and good job checking the fourth frame! This is a somewhat curious catch After scratching my head for a while the group at time seconds looks rather too complex to be another simple blip it might be an example of a proposed class of LIGO fireballs So I'd lean towards classifying this as a Blip which happens to have happened less than two seconds after another kind of glitch And indeed it turns out that the present subject is among those which had been used to train the Machine Learning as an example of a Blip You can see that label when you click on the nfo button Only subjects from the ML training set have such labels In the first three workflow levels where the Repeating Blips class is not yet available the alternative would be to call it None Of The Above which ensures that more people are going to get a look and which helps to shift such subjects towards the more advanced workflows offering additional classes But the general rule for combinations of two or more different kinds of glitches is to focus on the one closest to time seconds or dominant at this time provided that it's recognizable and ignore the rest This helps to teach the ML to recognize common glitch types even in crowded surroundings Thank you for contributing! This happened at LIGO Hanford not at Virgo during the third rather than the second observing run so the Virgo O specific glitch class cannot apply but the group as a whole shares some fireballish traits closely but irregularly spaced repetitions of short duration broadband constituent "glitchlets" Possible LIGO analogues of Virgo's fireballs are still being studied and thus not yet available as an official class For the moment I would recommend to call this subject a Koi Fish based on the central feature Please be welcome though to start a collection of subjects reminding you of fireballs! Like some of us have already been doing And or of anything else that looks worth collecting to you  Tips just display DYCWMI collection and assign sequential number g line numbers divide that number by and add that will be pages you want to find  Thank you I will try that out  Yes indeed good point except in cases when the collection contains "zooid does not exist" subjects that don't show up among the DYCWMI output then it'll be slightly off Fortunately that can't happen when a collection has been built up entirely from the results of prior similarity searches  I don know how to add line numbers Maybe I will leave this for now  Perhaps it might be easier on laptop computer open text file with any editor and give it a line number to check ex sort by subject number and then download as csv in Excel worksheet shows header row by default as reference and Linux for me I always check it this way vi " set number" Downloads any csv and see  Thank you Nicm I use an iPad but have Pages I think the time I would need to learn how to do this would be far greater than just going through the pages of my collections but I will bear it in mind  Maybe I could use Numbers on the iPad but I am having a break from that at the moment  I have had a look at Apple Numbers and the lines are already numbered except the is one place too high Presumably you would have to sort by snr first to get the duplicates then sort by subject to get the order that they should theoretically appear in the collection I can see this would be useful for huge collections I really appreciate your help Nicm though at the moment I will stick to the way I know but it has been another useful exercise looking at how I could use Numbers in the future   line Series of 25sb  line  line Another interloper in my bliplet searches 07Hz what sea creature is this?

BNS range plot afternoon https logbook virgo gw eu virgo uploads png https logbook virgo gw eu virgo uploads png  I have been running a DYCWMI and was able to copy the results it Apple Numbers on the iPad I sorted the snr column and the following came up for two subjects S as above and S However they do not look the same What on earth have I done wrong? scream  I am removing this subject from my Livingston bliplets around 40Hz collection as it is 39Hz  OK Nicm I have been able to follow your advice on finding the correct page in my collections Your instructions worked well thank you! My only problem was scrolling down to find that page I ended up going up by pages then doing next then another pages or wherever I needed to be and found the correct page I have been able to download the DYCWMI csv file to Numbers and can sort columns Each cell is automatically numbered I have also fished out a wireless keyboard that I have had for years but rarely used Without it I can for example easily scroll to the bottom of a table The learning curve continues! Thank you very much for your time stamps and 3D imaging I never know what I will find when I go onto the Talk page in the morning!  Agriculture? Faint  line  line low frequency blips Why does the signal bottom right frame disappear when moving to frame 2? Huh that's unusual I had thought that it's too unlikely for different glitches to ever result in the same SNR value but apparently it can occasionally happen Learn something new every day Unrelated remark Seems you have unintentionally had Sim Search create a collection of on the other subject which you may want to delete again has since been deleted again Happens to me too about once a month!  I was drafting a post about identical SNRs for different subjects I came upon them some time ago but had no time till now to look back at those cases into more detail Yes it might be unfortunately more common than expected Will elaborate further when I post  That was a bug in the version of the spectrogram computing software in use at the time late when the Virgo O2a subjects were processed in preparation for uploading them to Zooniverse Back then the 25s window was somewhat incorrectly cut out of the time series of raw data More often this shows up as a dark feature in the bottom right corner of the first frame that has no counterpart in the subsequent frames Here we have a less common example where it has produced a spurious bright blob  Good to hear about the keyboard it will certainly easy things Glad you are managing Numbers better  Thank you I am glad it not me! I will leave both of them in the collection The odds against getting that exact number must be pretty high! Collection deleted I am a bit bogged down with all this today  Let say I am a bit better than I was last time! I used to print my DYCWMI but my bliplets take up pages so I am not wasting that much paper Therefore it had to be Numbers  A few spot checks say that while more common than expected when I expected it to never happen in practice such coincidences are still very rare occurs four times in the whole O data release and I've found some other values which occur two or three times within all of LIGO O The occurrences are widely separated in time glitch classes other metadata values and places of origin one of the four is from Hanford so they can't be mistaken for one another Thus the SNR column still serves for spotting duplicates when they are present we just need to be aware that a repeated value might not necessarily indicate a duplicate subject  Thank you Interesting Aren I lucky to have two in my bliplets collection?!  Thank you for the feedback ZngabitanT If you spotted those instances in the whole O data release it gives an idea of how contained it is for O The SNR column is still very valuable I had spotted occasional instances by opening the subject page for every plicate retrieved in past sim searches but was not sure whether it had been a tool hiccup or a pattern  Hi There are instances where the SNR value from sim search results is identical for different glitches as it would also be the more general case of pointing to multiple identical copies of a single glitch Below is a quartet of results from a Hanford O sim search for seed https www zooniverse org We have four different glitches under the same SNR and the rest of metadata values For SNR https www zooniverse org Sardine https www zooniverse org Elongated Blip https www zooniverse org Trumpetfish https www zooniverse org Whistle Some time ago Hanford O Whistle appeared profusely in sim search results for Blip ssp trumpetfish sardine and similar morphologies I suspect that the tool confusion above for this identical quartet might be caused by a similar sim search bias Regarding collection management I see two scenarios so far on how to practically handle this issue each with their pros and cons Not adding false duplicates to collections Different glitches with identical SNR are left out This would not change the already time consuming cleanup routine involving multiple steps to produce a representative collection Adding false duplicates to collections Different glitches with identical SNR are part of a collection Some subjects being true copies while others false ones would increase the number of routines to produce a representative collection While this might occur sporadically there is an extra aspect to look into for SNR identical values Thank you Related conversation https www zooniverse org where mitchnanny was also experiencing this uncommon issue  it kinda looks like scattered light but if you look at the longer timespan the shape becomes a bit weird idk at first it looks like a low frequency line but lasts way too little to be one very short low frequency line  it looks like a blip and a whistle fused together I'm afraid I can't reproduce this example as described Running a similarity search asking for the maximum number of results ifo H era O starting from and sorting the results on the SNR column returns four occurrences of the SNR value and these are identical quadruplicate copies of a single glitch trigger There are no other LIGO O subjects with this exact SNR value I've checked this in the data release https doi org zenodo have a reported SNR of this value coincidentally occurs once again for one unrelated glitch subject from Livingston O3b has SNR unique among LIGO O subjects has SNR unique among LIGO O subjects has SNR which reoccurs just once in LIGO O for a Livingston O3b subject In any case there is no confusion here on the Similarity Search tool https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search 's part it merely reports the SNR values that had been computed by the Omicron glitch detection software when it was originally triggered and there is no a priori guarantee that the computed values for different glitches must be different This is merely rather unlikely a priori because the values are the outcome of a calculation based on the raw glitch data and not unlike the peak frequencies merely a selection from a predefined list of discrete bins Also the similarity scoring doesn't take the SNR values into account so it cannot be confused by them There's no reason not to include two manifestly different subjects with coinciding SNR values in a collection when both fit the collection criteria in other respects It's only the inclusion of genuinely duplicate subjects coming from one and the same glitch trigger which would bias any conclusions about glitch rates that one may subsequently try to draw from the collection Repeated SNR values in a collection are not themselves an issue checking for repeated SNR values is merely the quickest way I know of for finding any real duplications in a collection  Yes this is a Scattered Light glitch and one of the last of this loud multi arch kind from Hanford By the time it was recorded on a fix had already been applied at Livingston and two days after it was recorded the same fix was rolled out at Hanford too Afterwards the engineers used Gravity Spy data to validate that their fix was as effective as they had hoped! These are quite hard to recognize until one has seen a lot of them actually it's a Crown thus None Of The Above in levels but processed with unusually fine frequency resolution at the expense of unusually coarse time resolution  This subject will fit into a proposed new glitch class of Coronets projects zooniverse gravity spy talk "little crowns" They first showed up in large numbers in mid January sharing the fast pacing of Crowns but staying confined to a narrow frequency band around Hz  Interesting catch! It's primarily a Whistle and yes it is fused with something I can't quite tell what that something might be but it seems to affect only frequencies below about Hz everything higher up is part of the Whistle  Sounds good thank you for letting me know! Thank you for the explanations This is puzzling as I got my identical quadruplicate false copies with SNR for a search on results on Han O with said seed This same search also yielded an additional two pairs of different subjects with identical SNR For SNR like your Han and Liv above https www zooniverse org https www zooniverse org and For SNR https www zooniverse org https www zooniverse org See below a snippet showing these cases from the spreadsheet downloaded from the sim search already sorted by SNR I added an empty line between the instances ! False duplicates https imgur com MaejBye jpg https imgur com MaejBye jpg It is also surprising that in one search three instances of false duplicates appeared I am travelling tomorrow but I shall keep looking into this because the discrepancies are strange Any ideas?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

They began appearing in large numbers in mid-January and share the rapid pacing of Crowns but do not spread across as wide a frequency range.\n   - **Gnarly Whistles**: Proposed as a variant of the "Whistle" glitch class. These are described in the context of being fused with other glitch types, suggesting complex interactions or composite glitch formations.\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes**:\n   - There are indications of discrepancies in the SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) values reported for different glitches that may appear similar, raising questions about the reliability of SNR as a unique identifier for glitches. This issue is highlighted through instances where different glitches share identical SNR values, which may complicate the process of classifying and identifying unique glitch occurrences.\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects**:\n   - Questions arise about the Q transform method used in glitch analysis, specifically whether it might be limiting the classification capabilities. Discussions include whether classification should rely solely on Q-transform plots or if one-dimensional timeseries data could provide more accurate insights.\n   - There are inquiries about the potential loss of information when color scales (used in visualizing glitches) are cut or adjusted, affecting the accuracy of glitch classification based on 2D images.\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins**:\n   - A specific hypothesis suggests that the peculiar shape and behavior of certain glitches could be due to environmental factors or operational conditions at the time of their detection. This includes suggestions that electronic devices left on near sensors could induce specific types of noise observed in the data.\n   - The appearance of "Coronets" around 70 Hz is hypothesized to be linked to specific mechanical or operational changes in the sensor setups, reflecting an understanding of how modifications in the experimental setup could lead to new types of observable glitches.\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels**:\n   - Discussions in Talk Dataset 2 express concerns about how different sensors or channels might be uniquely affected by external conditions, leading to specific glitch appearances. For instance, the variations in the "Scattered Light" glitch class across different observing runs and between LIGO and Virgo observatories suggest sensor-specific responses to environmental conditions.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations and Observations**:\n   - The community is actively engaging in the use of tools like GWpy for analyzing glitches, prompting discussions on the effectiveness and limitations of these tools in providing accurate representations of glitches, especially in higher dimensions (3D).\n   - There is an ongoing dialogue about the need for improved navigation and management tools within the Zooniverse platform to handle large datasets more efficiently, particularly for sorting and identifying duplicates in glitch classifications. This includes suggestions for enhancements that would allow easier deletion or categorization of glitches directly from the user interface.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1714008737, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_76f018034d', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=622, prompt_tokens=31262, total_tokens=31884))

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the comment text and the second was the URL affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies  https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/

I would file this under moderately messy Scattered Light Hanford O style By the time late November the present S got recorded the medium frequency ripple comb glitches that had been common from mid July onwards had become rare again at Hanford For comparison here's a late MF ripple S from October fourth frames of the two subjects side by side both rendered at Q ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location f 733d 42da 8b 097033091dc png ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 7f a c a 4ff c 20354 f dd png The differences can be subtle The ripples tend ed to last much longer than four seconds at a time we usually see only pieces of them Hanford O Scattered Light features at typically slightly lower frequencies usually form shorter groups each group lasting about seconds Only on a few exceptional days did they continue beyond both the left and right edges The Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search also helps here The MF ripples almost always have peak frequencies near or or or Hz Scattered Light glitches mostly live at somewhat lower frequencies and once they manage to rise above the Hz background noise band they do not prefer any particular narrow frequency bands since the frequencies at which they show up are dictated by how fast the reflecting item is moving at any given moment which varies on a continuous scale  https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/

    Also, importantly, we already know about several glitch classes. So if you see these, they are not new:
    - 1080 Line 
    - 1400 Ripple 
    - 70 Hz Line 
    - Air Compressor (50 Hz)
    - Blip 
    - Chirp 
    - Crown 
    - Extremely Loud 
    - Helix 
    - Koi Fish 
    - Low-Frequency Line

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

However, these descriptions do not explicitly declare a new classification but suggest unique characteristics that might be different enough to warrant a new classification in the future. This indicates active engagement in refining and possibly expanding the classification schema but does not establish a formally recognized new category within the data provided.\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   There are discussions suggesting ambiguity and questioning the adequacy of current glitch classifications:\n   - A mention of a glitch identified as a "low frequency blip" that might be a "quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk." This reflects uncertainty about the precise boundaries or characteristics that define certain glitch classes.\n   - Confusion about whether certain patterns are "repeating blips" or "wheatgrass" or part of a "koi fish" configuration. These discussions indicate that the existing classes might not comprehensively cover all observed patterns, or there\'s overlap that causes classification challenges.\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes, Sensors, or Gravitational Wave Science:**\n   - There are questions about the origins or causes of certain glitches, such as whether a "Cuneiform type loud glitch" is related to quieter instances of another known glitch type.\n   - Discussions also hint at the need for understanding the technical aspects of data processing, particularly how data processing artifacts might influence the appearance of high-frequency noise, suggesting gaps in understanding or clarifying how data integrity could affect glitch analysis.\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins:**\n   - There are specific hypotheses about the environmental influences on glitches, such as the impact of seismic activities leading to locklosses and their correlation with observed glitches.\n   - Another hypothesis discusses the effect of maintenance activities and equipment adjustments at the LIGO facilities (like changes in DARM ESD actuation) on the visibility of certain glitches. These insights reveal a deeper analytical engagement with understanding how operational conditions at gravitational wave observatories might influence data quality and glitch characteristics.\n\n5. **Concerns Related to Sensors or Channels:**\n   - There is a detailed discussion about how glitches are affected by changes in sensor settings or operational conditions at specific detectors (e.g., switching from ETMY to ETMX actuation and its impact on observed glitches).\n   - Concerns are also raised about how the data processing software\'s handling of abrupt data stream interruptions could misrepresent the actual glitch characteristics, indicating worries about the fidelity of sensor outputs under certain data-handling constraints.\n\nIn summary, Talk Dataset 2 shows an advanced level of engagement with glitch classification, a deepening curiosity about the technical and environmental factors influencing glitch data, and an emerging sophistication in hypothesizing about the origins and implications of observed glitches. This engagement reflects a matured dialogue among citizen scientists, perhaps influenced by ongoing discussions, increased familiarity with the subject matter, and a community-driven push towards refining the scientific understanding of gravitational wave data anomalies.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1719787132, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_7d35882d38', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=647, prompt_tokens=5854, total_tokens=6501))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the comment text and the second was the URL affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk Dataset 1:

     Extremely loud but interesting due to the loud high frequency static https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ A ripple comb with some interesting shapes that are louder than the rest including the squashed at the and the paired lines between and https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365862/ Well observed and an interesting example ! Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/ Looks like a ripple comb coming to a end louder than the earlier part of the comb shown https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/ Scattered Light and more Scattered Light these are two successive stacks of parallel arches each with the top of a lower arch around Hz and a "cap" or "eyebrow" arch above it around Hz Usually such stacks are caused by the same stray light path being traversed more than once With each additional roundtrip the rate of change of the total path length traversed expressed as number of laser wavelengths per second and thus giving the frequency at which the noise will show up increases by a similar amount https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367332/ Good question I'm not sure what to make of this It's either a single group or "flock" lasting about seconds and ending with a smallish Koi Fish or a flock of blips lasting only seconds centered around time seconds followed by a separate smallish Koi Fish by coincidence https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/ A bit of a head scratcher thinking The central Koi Fish may be part of the flock of blips that starts around time seconds or else it might be an independent glitch appearing next to it by sheer coincidence Either way the parentheses are part of the Koi's "fins" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/ Another nice example from this lot tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Plus a little stack of scattered light archlets around time seconds unusually neatly shaped as Hanford O scattered light goes which often looks rather messier Sometimes it's much easier to assign a glitch to a population taking into account when it had happened and what else had been happening around the same time and then the entire population to a proposed class than to classify each individual subject separately especially when as in this case the individual examples show quite a lot of variability https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/ I would file this under moderately messy Scattered Light Hanford O style By the time late November the present S got recorded the medium frequency ripple comb glitches that had been common from mid July onwards had become rare again at Hanford For comparison here's a late MF ripple S from October fourth frames of the two subjects side by side both rendered at Q ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location f 733d 42da 8b 097033091dc png ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 7f a c a 4ff c 20354 f dd png The differences can be subtle The ripples tend ed to last much longer than four seconds at a time we usually see only pieces of them Hanford O Scattered Light features at typically slightly lower frequencies usually form shorter groups each group lasting about seconds Only on a few exceptional days did they continue beyond both the left and right edges The Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search also helps here The MF ripples almost always have peak frequencies near or or or Hz Scattered Light glitches mostly live at somewhat lower frequencies and once they manage to rise above the Hz background noise band they do not prefer any particular narrow frequency bands since the frequencies at which they show up are dictated by how fast the reflecting item is moving at any given moment which varies on a continuous scale https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/

ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9fxYQIXgXlqA26gAl9RSyvmcnP97I', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='### Novel Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2\n\n1. **New Glitch Class:**\n   - **Description**: In Talk Dataset 2, there is mention of a "ripple comb with some interesting shapes that are louder than the rest." Although this bears some resemblance to known glitch types like "Repeating Blips" and "Scattered Light," the discussion seems to indicate unique characteristics that might warrant the definition of a new subclass or even an entirely separate glitch category. The emphasis on the pattern and amplitude variation could be significant for distinguishing this glitch from others.\n\n### Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n\n2. **Concerns About Classifications:**\n   - **Persisting Issues**: There are ongoing discussions about the sufficiency and accuracy of existing glitch classifications. In particular, there\'s mention of artifacts like high frequency bands potentially being misclassified due to abrupt data processing cutoffs, which could affect the classification of glitches occurring at the edges of the data stream.\n   - **Emerging Concerns**: There\'s a specific concern about the categorization and response to the "Scattered Light" glitch due to its varied manifestations and impact at different frequency bands, suggesting that the current classification might be too broad or not adequately descriptive.\n\n### Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science\n\n3. **Emerging Questions:**\n   - **Questions About Sensors and Glitch Effects**: In Talk Dataset 2, there\'s an inquiry into whether the "Koi Fish" glitch appearing is part of a flock of blips or a separate occurrence, which probes deeper into the behavior and classification interdependencies of glitches.

    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

     Extremely loud but interesting due to the loud high frequency static https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ A ripple comb with some interesting shapes that are louder than the rest including the squashed at the and the paired lines between and https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365862/ Well observed and an interesting example ! Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    Below are a list of things I would like an answer for. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

    Now consider Talk Dataset 2:
     Extremely loud but interesting due to the loud high frequency static https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ A ripple comb with some interesting shapes that are louder than the rest including the squashed at the and the paired lines between and https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365862/ Well observed and an interesting example ! Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/ Looks like a ripple comb coming to a end louder than the earlier part of the comb shown https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/ Scattered Light and more Scattered Light these are two successive stacks of parallel arches each with the top of a lower arch around Hz and a "cap" or "eyebrow" arch above it around Hz Usually such stacks are caused by the same stray light path being traversed more than once With each additional roundtrip the rate of change of the total path length traversed expressed as number of laser wavelengths per second and thus giving the frequency at which the noise will show up increases by a similar amount https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367332/ Good question I'm not sure what to make of this It's either a single group or "flock" lasting about seconds and ending with a smallish Koi Fish or a flock of blips lasting only seconds centered around time seconds followed by a separate smallish Koi Fish by coincidence https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/ A bit of a head scratcher thinking The central Koi Fish may be part of the flock of blips that starts around time seconds or else it might be an independent glitch appearing next to it by sheer coincidence Either way the parentheses are part of the Koi's "fins" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/ Another nice example from this lot tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Plus a little stack of scattered light archlets around time seconds unusually neatly shaped as Hanford O scattered light goes which often looks rather messier Sometimes it's much easier to assign a glitch to a population taking into account when it had happened and what else had been happening around the same time and then the entire population to a proposed class than to classify each individual subject separately especially when as in this case the individual examples show quite a lot of variability https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/ I would file this under moderately messy Scattered Light Hanford O style By the time late November the present S got recorded the medium frequency ripple comb glitches that had been common from mid July onwards had become rare again at Hanford For comparison here's a late MF ripple S from October fourth frames of the two subjects side by side both rendered at Q ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location f 733d 42da 8b 097033091dc png ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 7f a c a 4ff c 20354 f dd png The differences can be subtle The ripples tend ed to last much longer than four seconds at a time we usually see only pieces of them Hanford O Scattered Light features at typically slightly lower frequencies usually form shorter groups each group lasting about seconds Only on a few exceptional days did they continue beyond both the left and right edges The Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search also helps here The MF ripples almost always have peak frequencies near or or or Hz Scattered Light glitches mostly live at somewhat lower frequencies and once they manage to rise above the Hz background noise band they do not prefer any particular narrow frequency bands since the frequencies at which they show up are dictated by how fast the reflecting item is moving at any given moment which varies on a continuous scale https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/

    Below are a list of things I would like an answer for. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362094/ The Machine Learning part of Gravity Spy thinks of this and similar subjects as Low Frequency Lines based on how it had been trained in the past But they aren't "lines" in the spectral line sense tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk They are high Q renderings of very low frequency Scattered Light arches cut off below either by the Hz bottom edge or already at Hz by always very loud background noise and cut off above by ever present loud background noise in the Hz band The background noise gets suppressed in our images At Livingston during O4a and O4b so far such very low frequency glitches account for more subjects than everything else put together which isn't quite obvious when classifying them here on Zooniverse due to the peculiar ways how subjects get distributed across the workflow levels From the point of view of how they are caused I've been leaning towards calling them Scattered Light From a practical point of view however it might make sense to keep them separate from Scattered Light glitches that rise above the Hz noise band into the Hz region where they do more harm to clean observing time than down there near the bottom edge even though it's one kind of glitch caused by one and the same kind of mechanism just a difference in how fast the reflecting item was moving at the time Our current classification scheme doesn't capture these aspects very well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3361831/ NOTA unknown 60Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362310/ "NotNoGlitch" There had to be noise at least a factor of above the background in order to trigger a Gravity Spy subject and extracting these data for the present S with the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search we find an SNR of peak frequency Hz and duration of seconds as recorded by the glitch detection software Omicron So this is really going to be very low frequency Scattered Light but the Hz bottom edge of our images is dark purple Now that is a hint that something even louder must have been happening either before or usually afterwards so it's worth checking also the approximate time after UTC from the hours wide rectangle centered on it as displayed by a Sim Search asking for a single result and then heading to the logbook tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG and the status summary pages tab https gwosc org detector status The status page for tab https gwosc org detector status day includes a plot of the observing segments on that date !

    Now consider Talk Dataset 2:
     Extremely loud but interesting due to the loud high frequency static https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ A ripple comb with some interesting shapes that are louder than the rest including the squashed at the and the paired lines between and https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365862/ Well observed and an interesting example ! Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/ Looks like a ripple comb coming to a end louder than the earlier part of the comb shown https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/ Scattered Light and more Scattered Light these are two successive stacks of parallel arches each with the top of a lower arch around Hz and a "cap" or "eyebrow" arch above it around Hz Usually such stacks are caused by the same stray light path being traversed more than once With each additional roundtrip the rate of change of the total path length traversed expressed as number of laser wavelengths per second and thus giving the frequency at which the noise will show up increases by a similar amount https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367332/ Good question I'm not sure what to make of this It's either a single group or "flock" lasting about seconds and ending with a smallish Koi Fish or a flock of blips lasting only seconds centered around time seconds followed by a separate smallish Koi Fish by coincidence https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/ A bit of a head scratcher thinking The central Koi Fish may be part of the flock of blips that starts around time seconds or else it might be an independent glitch appearing next to it by sheer coincidence Either way the parentheses are part of the Koi's "fins" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/ Another nice example from this lot tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Plus a little stack of scattered light archlets around time seconds unusually neatly shaped as Hanford O scattered light goes which often looks rather messier Sometimes it's much easier to assign a glitch to a population taking into account when it had happened and what else had been happening around the same time and then the entire population to a proposed class than to classify each individual subject separately especially when as in this case the individual examples show quite a lot of variability https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/ I would file this under moderately messy Scattered Light Hanford O style By the time late November the present S got recorded the medium frequency ripple comb glitches that had been common from mid July onwards had become rare again at Hanford For comparison here's a late MF ripple S from October fourth frames of the two subjects side by side both rendered at Q ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location f 733d 42da 8b 097033091dc png ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 7f a c a 4ff c 20354 f dd png The differences can be subtle The ripples tend ed to last much longer than four seconds at a time we usually see only pieces of them Hanford O Scattered Light features at typically slightly lower frequencies usually form shorter groups each group lasting about seconds Only on a few exceptional days did they continue beyond both the left and right edges The Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search also helps here The MF ripples almost always have peak frequencies near or or or Hz Scattered Light glitches mostly live at somewhat lower frequencies and once they manage to rise above the Hz background noise band they do not prefer any particular narrow frequency bands since the frequencies at which they show up are dictated by how fast the reflecting item is moving at any given moment which varies on a continuous scale https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/

    Below are a list of things I would like an answer for. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?
