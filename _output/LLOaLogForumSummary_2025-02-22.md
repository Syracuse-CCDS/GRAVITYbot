### Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors from ALOG Dataset 2:

1. **OMC Pitch Issues**:
   - Problem: The OMC pitch via dither signals was observed to be running away, suggesting a possible shift in the mechanical resonance of the system.
   - Explanation: The optical mechanical controls (OMC) of the interferometer were facing issues where the pitch control was not stable and was deviating from its intended path, which could affect the accuracy and stability of the laser beams within the LIGO detector.

2. **ETMY Sensor Adjustments**:
   - Problem: After a reboot of the ETMY frontend, several changes to the ETMY ST blend filter banks were noted and could not be immediately explained or justified.
   - Explanation: The ETMY (end test mass at the Y arm of the interferometer) sensor had unexpected modifications in its settings after maintenance, which were unexplained and had potential implications for the sensor's performance.

### Alterations to Particular Sensors from ALOG Dataset 2:

1. **OMC Pitch Settings Reversion**:
   - Alteration: After identifying issues with the OMC pitch, the old pitch settings were reverted, but with adjustments to the dither frequency to attempt to stabilize the resonance behavior.
   - Explanation: The team working on the interferometer attempted to correct the instability in the OMC by reverting to older settings while making slight modifications, suggesting ongoing adjustments are required to optimize performance.

2. **Reboot and Modifications of ETMY Sensor**:
   - Alteration: The ETMY sensor underwent a reboot, after which several settings changes were made, particularly in the blend filter banks, which were reverted back to previous settings from recent changes.
   - Explanation: To address unexpected behavior in the ETMY sensor after a system reboot, engineers restored previous filter settings, indicating an attempt to return to a known good state to ensure stable operations.
