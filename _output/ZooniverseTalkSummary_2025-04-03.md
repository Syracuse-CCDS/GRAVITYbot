1. **New Glitch Class Proposals:**
   - A new glitch classification suggested this week is a class potentially called "Flock of Blips". Citizen scientists describe it as a group of blips clustered together, indicating a pattern or behavior distinct from a singular blip or scattered light. This classification came up due to observations of multiple blips appearing in close proximity, suggesting a new pattern worthy of its own category.

   - Another potential new glitch class discussed is related to “Wheatgrass” and “Flock of Seagulls”, noting a combination of patterns that were not notably grouped before, suggesting evolving characteristics or a new understanding of existing data patterns.

2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**
   - Concerns were raised about the clarity and accuracy of the "Fuzzy Range" class, as it sometimes overlaps with other classes like Power Line glitches. Citizen scientists discussed the difficulty in distinguishing these classes due to their similar frequencies and appearances, indicating a potential need for reevaluation or clearer classification criteria.

3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Science:**
   - Questions emerged about the technical aspects of how glitches are identified and classified, particularly how Machine Learning algorithms are trained and their accuracy in real-time glitch identification. This highlights a learning curve and an interest in the underlying technologies used in the Gravity Spy project.

4. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins:**
   - Hypotheses were proposed regarding the origins of certain glitches being related to seismic activities and their potential to induce specific glitch patterns in the LIGO data. This speaks to the citizen scientists' growing understanding of how local geophysical events can interfere with high-precision scientific instruments.

5. **Concerns About Connections to Sensors or Channels:**
   - Concerns were raised about the connection of certain glitches to specific sensors or channels, particularly questioning whether observed phenomena were glitches or issues with sensor outputs. This reflects a nuanced approach to data analysis, where participants try to discern between genuine astrophysical signals and noise.
