1. **Proposed New Glitch Classes in Talk Dataset 2:**
   - **Beam Jitter Frequency Bands**: This new glitch class is suggested due to the observation of beam jitter glitches that appear at specific frequency bands. The class is proposed to encompass these glitches that are characterized by their unique frequency band occurrence, distinguishing them from other types of jitter or noise. This classification might help in better understanding and segregating the beam-related anomalies from other signal disturbances. (URLs for reference: /328/3434569, /328/3434504)
   - **Medium Frequency (MF) Ripple**: Although not entirely new, there is a suggestion to adjust the understanding or categorization of the ripple glitches to specifically highlight their occurrence at medium frequencies. This reclassification or more precise definition helps in distinguishing these glitches from other frequency-specific glitches and acknowledges their unique characteristics in the medium frequency range.

2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**
   - **Confusion with Violin Mode Harmonics**: Concerns were expressed about the classification of some glitches as Violin Mode Harmonic when they appear at 11Hz, which is not typical for this category. The discussions indicate a misunderstanding or misclassification, suggesting a need to refine how these glitches are categorized or described to avoid placing them incorrectly under Violin Mode Harmonic. (URL for reference: /328/3430854)
   - **Inconsistency in Classifying New Types**: There are several mentions of glitches that do not fit into any existing classes, leading to frequent usage of None Of The Above (NOTA). This highlights a concern that existing classifications may not be comprehensive enough to cover newly observed phenomena, suggesting a need for ongoing revision and expansion of the glitch classification taxonomy.

3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**
   - **Questions about the Specificity of Data Channels**: There are emerging questions regarding the roles of specific data channels in capturing glitches, particularly whether certain channels might provide more detailed or specific observations of glitches. This curiosity stems from a deeper engagement with the technical infrastructure of gravitational wave detection and a desire to optimize the analysis of observed data. (URL for reference: /328/3431042)
   - **Inquiries Into Detailed Glitch Characteristics**: Questions are arising about the detailed characteristics of certain glitches, such as the exact conditions under which they appear and their frequency-specific behaviors. This indicates a growing sophistication in the citizen scientists' approach to glitch classification and a deeper interest in the physics of gravitational wave detection.

4. **Specific Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**
   - **Environmental Couplings**: There's a hypothesis that ground or floor motion coupling, particularly around 60Hz, might be influencing the detection of gravitational waves. This hypothesis is motivated by observations of correlated signals in gravitational strain measurements and accelerometer data, suggesting that vibrations from nearby machinery or structural movements could be coupling into sensitive measurements. (URL for reference: /328/3433257)
   - **Dust Particles Impacting Beam**: Another hypothesis discusses the potential for single dust grains falling through the beam path as a cause of loud glitches. This hypothesis is based on the understanding of the physical environment within the beam tubes and the potential for microscopic particles to disturb the laser path, despite the vacuum conditions.

5. **Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels in Talk Dataset 2:**
   - **Specificity of Sensors in Detecting Glitches**: There are discussions concerning whether specific sensors or auxiliary channels might be more effective or sensitive in detecting certain types of glitches. This line of questioning reflects a nuanced exploration of the apparatus and a desire to understand how different components contribute to the overall detection capabilities. (URL for reference: /329/3431042)
   - **Effectiveness of Channels in Glitch Analysis**: Questions are raised about the effectiveness of certain data channels in providing clear and usable data for glitch analysis, especially in the context of identifying and classifying new or unusual glitches. This reflects a deeper engagement with the technical setup and an interest in optimizing data usage for better scientific outcomes. (URL for reference: /328/3431042)
