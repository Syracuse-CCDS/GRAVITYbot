1. **Proposed New Glitch Classes in Talk Dataset 2:**
   - **Invisible Violins**: Mentioned in multiple discussions in Talk Dataset 2, this new class appears to be associated with specific high-frequency patterns that resemble known violin modes but occur without the expected visual cues. The term "invisible" suggests these are detected by their impact rather than direct observation.

   - **Marie Celeste**: This term appears to describe a glitch that abruptly appears and then vanishes, akin to the mysterious historical tale of the Marie Celeste ship. The classification might be inspired by the transient and unexplained nature of the glitch's appearance in data.

2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**
   - **Mislabeling Issues**: In Talk Dataset 2, there are concerns about mislabeling where certain glitches are wrongly classified under existing categories due to the automated Machine Learning process. For instance, many subjects that do not fit the characteristics of Whistles or Power Lines were initially categorized under these types due to flawed ML labels.
