### Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors

**1. Problems with ESD Linearization process:**
   - **Issue:** The changes made to improve ESD (Electrostatic Drive) linearization for low noise operations were not fully effective, indicating an unresolved issue in the overall system adjustments or modeling.
   - **Pedestrian Explanation:** Electrostatic Drives help control the motion of parts in the interferometer. Adjustments were made to better control these drives when the system is trying to detect very weak signals, but these adjustments haven't worked as expected. The engineers are still trying to figure out the best way to make these controls work more accurately.

**2. Problems with Oscillation in Controls:**
   - **Issue:** An oscillation was detected in the control signals of the interferometer, particularly related to the DHARD degree of freedom, which led to a lock loss. The exact cause of this oscillation has not been identified.
   - **Pedestrian Explanation:** The interferometer experienced unstable movements in one of its control systems, which unexpectedly disrupted its normal functioning, causing it to stop its observation momentarily. The precise reason for this instability is still unknown, needing further investigation.

### Alterations to Particular Sensors

**1. Changes in ESD Linearization for ETMX:**
   - **Alteration:** Modifications were made to the linearization model of the ESD (Electrostatic Drive) system for the ETMX (End Test Mass X), which included changing part of the code to handle negative values more effectively during the linearization process.
   - **Pedestrian Explanation:** The code that helps control the precise movements of a key component in the interferometer was altered to better handle certain technical scenarios. This change was necessary to ensure that the component moves smoothly without causing errors in the calculations.

**2. Adjustment of HDS Blades in HDS Suspension:**
   - **Alteration:** Installation and alignment of the HDS blades into the blade guard assembly at the top of the HXDS suspension assemblies were completed, ensuring proper alignment and pairing based on deflection measurements.
   - **Pedestrian Explanation:** Specialized components called HDS blades, which are part of the mechanism that helps support and stabilize key elements within the interferometer, were carefully installed and aligned. This process ensures that they operate correctly and maintain the precise alignment necessary for the interferometer's operations.
