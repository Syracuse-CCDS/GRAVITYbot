1. **Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors:**
   - **SQZ HV PMC SHG OPO PZT ZM PSAMS Sensor Issue**: There was a significant problem with the SQZ HV PMC SHG OPO PZT ZM PSAMS sensor as it went down unexpectedly, indicating an issue with the SQZ (squeezing) system specifically related to the Piezo-electric Transducer (PZT) which controls laser beam positioning within the system. The issue persisted since it was observed that the PZT voltages were not changing as expected, which prevented proper locking of the system.

2. **Alterations to Particular Sensors:**
   - **Adjustment to SQZ ANG ADJUST Guardian**: The SQZ ANG ADJUST guardian, part of the control system that adjusts the angle of squeezing (a quantum noise reduction technique), was altered to always be in the 'nominal' state 'ADJUST SQZ ANG ADF'. This change was made to streamline operations and avoid manual adjustments that were previously necessary due to conditional settings in the system.

These issues and adjustments highlight some of the ongoing challenges and modifications made to maintain the optimal functioning of LIGO's sophisticated instrumentation, particularly in the realm of enhancing the sensitivity and stability of the gravitational wave detection systems.
