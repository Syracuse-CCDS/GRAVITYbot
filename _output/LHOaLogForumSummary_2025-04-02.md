### Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors in ALOG Dataset 2

1. **Cross-coupling in OSEM Sensors**:
   - Issue: The cross-coupling between OSEM sensors' outputs was causing incorrect readings that affect the alignment and stability of the interferometer's mirrors.
   - Explanation: OSEM sensors help maintain the alignment of LIGOâ€™s mirrors. Incorrect cross-coupling readings can lead to errors in how these mirrors are positioned, potentially affecting the sensitivity and accuracy of gravitational wave detection.

### Alterations to Particular Sensors in ALOG Dataset 2

1. **Modification of M PR Osem Gains**:
   - Alteration: The gains of the M PR osem sensors were adjusted to new values to address the issue of cross-coupling.
   - Explanation: Adjusting the gains helps correct the sensor outputs so they accurately reflect the mirror positions without interference from other signals or couplings. This calibration is crucial for the precise operation of the interferometer.
