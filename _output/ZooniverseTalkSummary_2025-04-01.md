1. **New Glitch Classes Proposed This Week:**
   - **Flock of Blips**: This week, participants propose a new glitch class called "Flock of Blips," suggesting it might deserve its own classification due to its appearance and frequency occurrences. The glitches appearing in a "flock" or group formation are deemed significant enough to consider a separate category.
