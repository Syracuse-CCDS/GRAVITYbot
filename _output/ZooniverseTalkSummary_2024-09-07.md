1. **New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2:**
   - **Invisible Violins**: This new glitch class is mentioned as a distinct subclass of Violin Mode Harmonics. The characteristic of these glitches is that they represent elevated stationary noise levels in DARM and strain, varying only gradually, which often do not visually stand out in spectrograms. These glitches are suggested to be from elevated stationary noise levels rather than actual strain variations, making them "invisible" in terms of direct impact on visual data.

2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**
   - **Classification of "NonNoGlitch" and "Violin Mode Harmonics"**: There's an expressed concern about the classification of certain glitches being called "No Glitch" by Machine Learning when they should be classified under existing categories like Violin Mode Harmonics. These instances highlight issues with the ML algorithm not correctly identifying known patterns.

4. **Hypotheses about Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**
   - **Beam Jitter**: Some glitches are hypothesized to originate from beam jitter, where the laser beam wobbles before entering the vacuum chamber. This hypothesis is supported by observations of technicians working near sensitive equipment, correlating physical disturbances with glitch occurrences.
   - **Environmental Factors**: There's an ongoing discussion about the impact of environmental factors like seismic activities and their correlation with glitch events, specifically noting instances like earthquakes impacting sensor readings.

5. **Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels in Talk Dataset 2:**
   - There are discussions about specific sensors or channels affecting the type and visibility of glitches. For instance, the way certain glitches appear or are classified may depend on which sensor channel is being analyzed, leading to questions about the consistency and reliability of sensor outputs across different channels.
   - This reflects a growing sophistication in the understanding of participants about how data acquisition and processing can affect glitch identification and classification.
