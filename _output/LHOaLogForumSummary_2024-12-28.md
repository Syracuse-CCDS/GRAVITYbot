### Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors in ALOG Dataset 2

1. **Issue with BSC PT and HAM PT sensors:**
   - **Description**: There have been glitches with the BSC PT and HAM PT sensors, where the HAM PT sensor glitched to 0 Torr while the BSC glitch seemed related but less clear.

2. **Issue with the ITM ESD voltage interlock system:**
   - **Description**: The high voltage interlock system for ITM ESD was repurposed for HAM high voltage, causing issues during the locking sequence and necessitating workarounds.

3. **Problem with the HAM vacuum gauge PT:**
   - **Description**: The HAM vacuum gauge PT failed, resulting in an audible alarm and cessation of high power operations. This required intervention and changing the interlock configuration.

### Alterations to Particular Sensors in ALOG Dataset 2

1. **Modification to the HAM interlock for Fast Shutter operations:**
   - **Description**: The HAM Interlock for Fast Shutter operations was altered to use the BSC Interlock or the BSC vacuum gauge after bypassing the failed HAM vacuum gauge.

2. **Changes in the ISS diffraction power settings:**
   - **Description**: The ISS diffraction power had to be adjusted, and code changes were made to handle the logging and monitoring of this parameter more effectively.
