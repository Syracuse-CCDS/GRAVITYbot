1. **New Glitch Classes Proposed This Week:**
   - **Flock of Blips:** A new potential glitch class mentioned this week is described as "a flock of blips." This description suggests a grouping or clustering of blip-like glitches that appear together and might be consistent enough to form a new class. This new class indicates an observed pattern that differs from solitary blips, suggesting a new or different underlying cause or detection scenario.

2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**
   - **Confusion Over Class Definitions:** This week continues to show some ambiguity in class definitions. For instance, discussions around whether certain signals should be classified under existing classes like "Blip" or "Tomte" surface, indicating ongoing confusion or insufficient classification criteria.
