1. **Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors**

   - **Frontend Issue with SUSAUXH56**: A problem was identified with the SUSAUXH56 frontend where an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) did not come back online after a reboot, indicating that the ADC needed to be swapped.
     - **Explanation**: The frontend is a crucial part of LIGO's data acquisition system that converts analog signals from sensors into digital data for processing. If this part fails, it can affect the quality and integrity of data collection. The ADC did not recover after multiple attempts to reboot, suggesting a hardware failure.

2. **Alterations to Particular Sensors**

   - **Adjustment of the SQZ Phase Angle**: The squeezing (SQZ) phase angle was adjusted remotely by an operator named Begum to improve the measurement range and sensitivity of the interferometer.
     - **Explanation**: The squeezing phase angle is crucial for enhancing the sensitivity of LIGO's measurements by reducing quantum noise. By fine-tuning this angle, operators can optimize the detector's performance in observing gravitational waves.
