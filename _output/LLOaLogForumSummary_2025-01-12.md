### Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors in ALOG Dataset 2

1. **Squeezer Alignment Issues**
   - **Issue**: The squeezer, a device used to reduce quantum noise and enhance the sensitivity of the interferometer, faced alignment challenges, contributing to suboptimal squeezing levels.
   - **Explanation**: Proper alignment of the squeezer is crucial for its function. Misalignment leads to less effective noise reduction, which can degrade the quality of data collected by the interferometer.
