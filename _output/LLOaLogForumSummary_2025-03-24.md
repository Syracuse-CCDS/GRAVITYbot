### Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors from ALOG Dataset 2:

1. **ITMX Seismic Isolation System Tripping**:
   - The ITMX (Input Test Mass X) seismic isolation system has been automatically tripping during lock losses, causing the interferometer to stop observing until manually reset. This problem occurred without any alarm notification during one instance, leading to the interferometer idly waiting for intervention.

2. **Glitches in CPS Boards at the Corner Station**:
   - There were glitches detected in the CPS (Calibration Plant System) boards at the corner station, which were thought to be causing issues with data integrity. Although the glitch seemed resolved after replacing associated hardware, there was uncertainty about the long-term stability of the fix.

### Alterations to Particular Sensors from ALOG Dataset 2:

1. **Replacement of CPS Timing Fanout Chassis and Boards**:
   - The CPS Timing Fanout Chassis was replaced due to it being identified as faulty. The original master board was noisy, affecting other boards synced to it. After replacing the chassis, the master board was swapped back to stabilize the system.
