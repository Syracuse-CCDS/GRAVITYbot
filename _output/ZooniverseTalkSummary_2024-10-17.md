1. **New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2:**
   - A potential new class identified is the **"Marie Celeste"** glitch, mentioned in the context of a discussion about scattered light. This glitch appears to manifest uniquely, distinguished by its characteristics from established classes. The name implies a mysterious or abandoned quality, possibly reflecting its unexpected and sporadic appearance in data.

2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**
   - Concerns are expressed about the **"Whistle"** glitch classification. It was noted that many subjects wrongly identified under this name have been moved to other classes, indicating a misclassification issue potentially due to inaccurate or outdated machine learning models.

3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science (Talk Dataset 2):**
   - Questions arise about the effectiveness and specificity of the **Glitch Classification** system, particularly with the shifting of some glitch classes to lower frequencies and the appearance of entirely new glitch types. This reflects an evolving understanding and adaptation in the community as the LIGO system itself is upgraded and modified.
     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3470496/
   - Queries about the **"Scattered Light"** class and its application to data from different runs or observatories (e.g., LIGO Hanford vs. Virgo) indicate a deeper dive into the nuances of glitch behaviors and their implications on gravitational wave detections.
     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3470733/
   - Discussions about whether certain patterns should be classified under existing classes like **"Tomte"** or new ones suggest a growing sophistication in interpreting the complex data provided by LIGO.

4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**
   - A hypothesis is mentioned concerning the **Richland WA earthquake** influencing glitch characteristics, which is indicated by a specific pattern called "Nessie with slightly smaller humps." This suggests a direct environmental impact on the data, providing a connection between geological events and data anomalies.
     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3464772/
   - Another hypothesis put forth involves potential issues with the **actuation systems** in the sensors during certain tests, which might lead to specific glitch appearances. This reflects an advanced analytical approach to understanding the mechanical and operational context of glitches.

5. **Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels (Talk Dataset 2):**
   - There are nuanced discussions about whether certain glitches are due to specific **sensors or test mass actuations** at LIGO Hanford Observatory (LHO). This shows an increased scrutiny of the hardware and operational specifics of LIGO, indicating a matured level of technical inquiry among citizen scientists.
