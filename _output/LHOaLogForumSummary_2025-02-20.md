### Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors

1. **Lockloss during transition from ETMX lock losses**:
   - **Issue**: Several lock losses occurred during the transition from low noise state (LOWNOISE ESD ETMX) while the gain was adjusting. This issue was consistent even after making adjustments to the ramp times and guardian settings. 
   - **Explanation**: The lock losses suggest a problem with the sensor calibration or control algorithm during the transition phase when handing control from one sensor to another or adjusting sensor settings. This could indicate a sensitivity or stability problem in the system that hasnâ€™t been resolved.

2. **Squeezer Pico left on**:
   - **Issue**: The squeezer (a device used to enhance the performance of the LIGO detectors by reducing quantum noise) pico was inadvertently left on since January 7th, which had not been documented in the logs. 
   - **Explanation**: Leaving the squeezer pico unintentionally on could affect the measurements and operations of other parts of the system, potentially introducing errors or noise that could compromise data integrity.

### Alterations to Particular Sensors

1. **Adjustment of the Squeezer Pico**:
   - **Alteration**: The squeezer pico was left on accidentally and had to be reverted back to its standard settings after being discovered.
   - **Explanation**: Adjustments to the squeezer settings are critical as they directly influence the quantum noise reduction capabilities of LIGO. Incorrect settings can lead to suboptimal performance and affect the sensitivity of the detectors.

2. **Ramping time change for DCPD sum during transitions**:
   - **Alteration**: The ramp time for a filter during transitions was increased to stabilize the DCPD sum levels, which were dropping too low during transitions, causing lock loss.
   - **Explanation**: The adjustments to the ramp time were necessary to ensure the stability of the sensor readings during state transitions, which are crucial for maintaining the lock state of the interferometer arms.

These issues and alterations are part of the regular maintenance and troubleshooting efforts to ensure the optimal performance of the LIGO detectors, which are highly sensitive instruments designed to detect gravitational waves.
