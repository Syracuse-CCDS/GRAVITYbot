User Prompt: 
    For the following text data, provide a list of primary topics of the data:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst? Maybe even a combination of glitches? maybe #scatteredlight :)
Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 apparently, this was also scatteredlight. :)

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band
