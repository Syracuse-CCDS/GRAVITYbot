1. **Unresolved issues related to particular sensors in ALOG Dataset 2:**
   - **Correlation between PI channels and glitches**: There is observed glitching in the strain channel that correlates with the activity in the PI (Piezoelectric) channel. This issue was identified while investigating frequency glitches affecting data quality.
     - **Explanation**: The strain channel, which measures gravitational wave signals, is showing unexpected noise or "glitches" that seem to occur together with signals from the PI channel, suggesting a connection between these glitches and the PI system.

2. **Alterations to particular sensors in ALOG Dataset 2:**
   - **Adjustment of ITMy Mode settings**: ITMy Mode settings were altered, specifically changing the feedback modulation (FM) settings to better damp vibrations or oscillations.
     - **Explanation**: The ITMy (one of the LIGO's mirror suspensions) was experiencing issues with vibration control. Adjustments were made to the feedback system that helps stabilize the mirror against such vibrations.

   - **Elevation of PI MODE channel**: The PI MODE channel was elevated to address an issue, but this resulted in increased glitching at specific frequencies.
     - **Explanation**: Adjustments to the PI MODE channel, which is involved in controlling piezoelectric actuators, led to increased noise or glitches at certain frequencies, suggesting that the adjustment might be causing unintended interference or instability.
