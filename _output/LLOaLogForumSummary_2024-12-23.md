1. **Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors**:

   - **Oscillation in Control Signals**: There was an unexplained oscillation in control signals observed on the strip tool on the large center display in the control room, leading to a lock loss. This suggests an issue in the control system or feedback mechanism that needs further investigation.

2. **Alterations to Particular Sensors**:

   - **Changes to ETM QUAD Models for ESD Linearization**: The ETM QUAD models were altered to incorporate a more generalized form of the linearization algorithm. This change was part of an attempt to improve the linear response of the Electrostatic Drive (ESD) system, which is crucial for maintaining the precise positioning of the test masses in LIGO.
