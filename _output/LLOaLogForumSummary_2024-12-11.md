1. **Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors**

   - **Voltage Reading Issues on SEI C and L VDC C**
     - There is a known issue with the SEI C power supply's monitor port outputting a lower than expected voltage relative to the actual voltage output, which could lead to erroneous readings and potential misconfigurations. Additionally, the monitor on the power supply for L VDC C is unconnected and outputting nonsensical data. This could cause confusion or errors in monitoring the power supply's status.

2. **Alterations to Particular Sensors**

   - **Change in OMC Dither Alignment**
     - The alignment of the Optical Mode Cleaner (OMC) dither, responsible for stabilizing the laser beam path, required adjustments. The dither lines' amplitudes were reinstated to nominal with a driver swap, indicating a change in equipment to maintain the expected operational parameters of the OMC.

   - **ESD Control Signals Adjustment**
     - During the Automatic Length Sensing System (ALS) locking process, two high Q lines at 14 Hz and 28 Hz were notched to improve the system's performance. This indicates fine-tuning of the Electrostatic Drive (ESD) controls to enhance the detection capabilities of LIGO by reducing specific frequency noise interference.
