### 1. Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors:

- **ITMY HEPI sensor functionality issue**: 
  - The ITMY HEPI (horizontal earthquake protection interface) sensor was found to be non-functional, which required swapping with another sensor to diagnose whether the problem was with the sensor itself or the electronics associated with it. This issue could affect the interferometer's ability to correctly compensate for horizontal ground movements, potentially impacting data accuracy.

- **ALS Y PLL locking issues**:
  - The ALS Y PLL (auxiliary laser system Y-axis phase-locked loop) had trouble locking, which was resolved by manually setting the crystal frequency. This problem could impact the stability and precision of the laser system used to refine the interferometer measurement.

### 2. Alterations to Particular Sensors:

- **ITMY HEPI AA chassis replacement**:
  - Due to the ongoing issues with the ITMY HEPI sensor, the AA chassis was identified as the root cause and subsequently replaced. This alteration was necessary to ensure that the horizontal earthquake protection system functions correctly, which is crucial for maintaining the interferometer's operational integrity during seismic events.

- **Adjustments to SGH GR for SQZ Operation**:
  - During operational checks, it was found that the SGH GR (squeezed light generator) rejected power was too high, posing a risk to the fiber optics involved. Adjustments were made to the half-wave plate (HWP) and quarter-wave plate (QWP) to reduce the rejected power level, ensuring safer and more efficient operation of the squeezed light system.

Each of these actions and unresolved issues are critical as they directly influence the functionality and accuracy of the LIGO observatory's measurements. The alterations are often reactive measures to ensure continued operation and data integrity in the face of hardware malfunctions or suboptimal configurations.
