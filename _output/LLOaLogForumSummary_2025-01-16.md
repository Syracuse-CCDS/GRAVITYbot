### Unresolved Issues Related to Sensors in ALOG Dataset 2

1. **Microseism Sensor Issues**:
   - Microseism sensors have been repeatedly indicating extremely high levels, preventing the interferometer from achieving its low-noise operational state. This issue affects the ability to lock the interferometer as the ground vibrations (microseisms) are too severe.

2. **Temperature Sensors on ITMY and ITMX**:
   - The temperature sensors adjacent to the ITM BSC chambers have reported significant fluctuations, which seem to correlate with changes in the interferometer's noise levels. This suggests a possible issue with sensor accuracy or environmental control at these sensitive locations.

### Alterations to Sensors in ALOG Dataset 2

1. **Adjustments to Beam Centering Involving Temperature Sensors**:
   - Adjustments were made to the beam centering by manipulating the heater settings for the IY and EY beams, which are measured by temperature sensors. This was an attempt to stabilize the beam against temperature-induced drifts.

2. **Insulation Added to Temperature Sensors**:
   - Extra insulation was added to some temperature sensors to minimize the influence of air temperature changes on the sensor readings. This modification aims to improve the accuracy and stability of temperature measurements that are crucial for maintaining precise control of the experimental conditions.
