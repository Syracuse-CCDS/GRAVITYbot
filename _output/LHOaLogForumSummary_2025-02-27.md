1. **Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors:**

   - **Guardian Issue with Violin Mode Damping:** The VIOLIN DAMPING guardian appears to have a bug that causes the system to drop out of the observing state under certain conditions, possibly due to a race condition that happens twice a year. The issue has been noted but not resolved.
     - **Explanation:** The VIOLIN DAMPING system, which controls vibrations on sensitive components called 'violins,' has a repeating issue causing the observatory to stop observing the cosmos. This problem occurs infrequently but predictably, indicating a deeper, unresolved problem in the systemâ€™s programming or configuration.

   - **Microseism and Wind Affecting Lock Acquisition:** There were numerous reports of environmental conditions like microseism (ground vibrations) and high winds causing issues with maintaining the lock state of the interferometer, suggesting unresolved sensitivity or stabilization problems.
     - **Explanation:** The LIGO observatory's ability to detect gravitational waves depends on its components remaining extremely stable. Ground vibrations and winds have repeatedly caused the instruments to lose their precise alignment, indicating ongoing challenges with environmental isolation.

2. **Alterations to Particular Sensors:**

   - **Adjustment of PMC (Pre-Mode Cleaner) Beam Alignment:** An attempt was made to tweak the PMC beam alignment due to an increase in the reflected signal variation. However, the adjustment did not yield a significant change, indicating ongoing issues with beam alignment stability.
     - **Explanation:** The PMC, which helps clean the laser beam before it enters the main interferometer, showed fluctuations in its reflected signals. Attempts to stabilize it by adjusting the alignment were not notably successful, suggesting possible unresolved mechanical or alignment issues.

   - **Adjustments to OMC (Output Mode Cleaner) Offsets:** Offsets on the OMC were adjusted to improve optical gain, which involved changing the input channels to the loops controlling the OMC. This was an intervention to correct the optical path to maximize the detection capability.
     - **Explanation:** The OMC refines the laser light exiting the interferometer, enhancing the ability to detect gravitational waves. Adjustments were made to improve how much signal is cleanly passed through, reflecting ongoing tuning to optimize sensitivity.

These activities highlight ongoing efforts to address and refine the performance of LIGO's sensitive instrumentation in response to environmental challenges and internal technical issues. Each alteration aims to stabilize the system and enhance its gravitational wave detection capabilities.
