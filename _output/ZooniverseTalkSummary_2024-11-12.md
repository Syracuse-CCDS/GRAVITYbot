1. **Proposed New Glitch Classes in Talk Dataset 2**:
   - **Fuzzy Range**: This glitch appears to be frequently discussed in Talk Dataset 2, with various observations on its distinct frequency behaviors. The proposed name reflects its characteristic appearance in the spectogram, often showing blurred or fuzzy boundaries that differentiate it from clearer, more defined glitch patterns.
   - **Photon Calibrator Meadow**: Derived from observations of irregular groups of low to medium frequency "flames" sometimes accompanied by scratches near 60 Hz. The glitches were related to a malfunction in the photon calibrator subsystem, suggesting a direct link to operational hardware influences.

2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes**:
   - **Misclassification Concerns**: In Talk Dataset 2, there is a concern about the accuracy of classifications provided by the automated system, especially highlighting the instances where new or rare glitches are misclassified into existing categories such as "Power Line" or "Pizzicato" due to their unfamiliar patterns to the trained algorithm.
   - **Applicability of Class Definitions**: There is a dialogue about whether older glitch classifications still apply effectively with the new data, suggesting that some classifications might have evolved or new types have emerged that don't fit the old categories.
