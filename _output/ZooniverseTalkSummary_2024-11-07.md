1. **New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2:**
   - **"Wheatgrass" Glitch:** This glitch type is referenced as a form of scattered light that appears in various discussions. It is described visually similar to blades of grass and seems to be a variant or subset of scattered light glitch classes, indicating a unique pattern observed by the participants. The term 'wheatgrass' seems to be a novel categorization specific to certain visual patterns seen in the spectograms.
   - **"Bike Chain" Glitch:** Mentioned as a possible new class, the "Bike Chain" glitch is described in terms that suggest a repetitive, linked pattern, reminiscent of a bicycle chain. This description appears to be a new classification that captures a specific repetitive visual form in the data.
   - **"Vibration Eruption:"** This potential new glitch class is discussed, although details are scant in the dataset. It seems to suggest a sudden, intense occurrence of signal that might be related to mechanical vibrations or disturbances near the sensor apparatus.

2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**
   - There are discussions that question the adequacy of current classifications, particularly with "None Of The Above" (NOTA) as a catch-all category. Citizen scientists express concerns that this category is becoming too broad, encompassing too many diverse glitch types that may need their own classifications.
   - Concerns about the "Repeating Blips" category are also mentioned, where the definition seems insufficient to encapsulate the variety of repeated patterns observed, suggesting that more granular classifications might be necessary to better categorize these phenomena.

3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science:**
   - Questions arise about how different "Q" values influence the appearance of glitches in spectrograms. Citizen scientists are curious about the technical processing that leads to different visual representations at varying "Q" values, indicating a deeper dive into the data processing techniques used in gravitational wave detection.
   - There is curiosity about how machine learning algorithms might be trained or improved to better distinguish between different types of glitches, especially those frequently misclassified or newly observed types.
   - Discussions about the potential scientific implications of observing new glitch types or patterns, such as whether they might indicate previously unrecognized environmental or instrumental influences, suggest a deepening engagement with the underlying physics.

4. **Hypotheses about Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**
   - Hypotheses about the "Wheatgrass" glitches suggest they might be caused by specific environmental conditions at the Livingston site, not observed at Hanford. This hypothesis is backed by discussions of localized environmental differences affecting the sensors differently.
   - The "Bike Chain" glitches hypothesized origins relate to mechanical vibrations or repetitive mechanical failures that could be influencing the sensor outputs. Discussions suggest a keen interest in correlating these glitches with maintenance logs or other mechanical activities near the detectors.

5. **Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels in Talk Dataset 2:**
   - There are specific inquiries about whether certain glitches are only observable in specific channels or if they manifest universally across all sensors, indicating a questioning of whether glitches are localized or systematic in nature.
   - Discussions about the alignment and calibration of sensors are evident, with citizen scientists questioning if misalignments or calibration errors could explain some of the observed anomalies in the data.
