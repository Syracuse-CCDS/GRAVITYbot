### 1. New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2

- **Vibration Eruptions**: This proposed class is described as glitches with characteristics of having shorter duration but possibly intense spikes in frequency, potentially linked to mechanical vibrations or movements within the detector setup. The motivation to define this new class stems from observations of unusual, transient bursts that don't fit into the existing models of known glitches.

### 2. Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes

- Concerns were raised about the **Scattered Light** class. Citizen scientists noted that this class's characteristics appear altered in newer observations compared to previous ones. Specifically, they remarked on the visibility and behavior of arches within the scattered light glitches, suggesting a possible evolution in the cause or detection of these glitches.

### 3. Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes, Sensors, or Gravitational Wave Science

- Citizen scientists are deeply curious about the exact nature of changes in the **Scattered Light** glitches and how modifications to sensor setups or environmental conditions might be influencing these changes. They question how physical or operational adjustments at LIGO may be driving the observed variations in glitch signatures.  
- Enquiries are also directed towards the educational aspects, such as how newer members can better understand the complexities of glitch categorization and the significance of each type in the broader context of gravitational wave detection.

### 4. Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2

- **A specific hypothesis was discussed** regarding the **Power Line (60 Hz)** glitches. It was suggested that these are caused by rapid switching of AC circuits, which transiently disrupts the line subtraction filtering, leading to characteristic glitches. This hypothesis is supported by a detailed understanding of electromechanical interactions within the detection setup, illustrating an advanced analytical approach by the citizen scientists.

### 5. Questions or Thoughts Concerning Connections to Sensors or Channels

- **PEM (Physical Environmental Monitoring) channels**: There are specific discussions on whether certain glitches could be better understood or categorized by correlating their occurrences with data from PEM channels. This reflects a nuanced approach to understanding the data, suggesting that different sensors or channels may offer additional insights into the origins or characteristics of certain glitches.
