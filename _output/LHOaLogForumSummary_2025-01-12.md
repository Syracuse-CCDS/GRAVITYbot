### Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors from ALOG Dataset 2

1. **PMC Reflected Power Issue**
   - Description: The reflected power of the PMC (Pre-Mode Cleaner) is reported as being high.
   - This means that the PMC, which is supposed to help clean the laser beam of noise by allowing only a specific mode of light to pass through, is reflecting too much light back instead of transmitting it. This could indicate alignment issues or problems with the PMC optics.

2. **Squeezing OPO Temperature Adjustment**
   - Description: The temperature of the squeezing OPO (Optical Parametric Oscillator) needed adjustments due to performance issues detected through the decline in the SQZ CLF REFL RF ABS OUTPUT channel.
   - Adjusting the temperature of the OPO can affect the efficiency of the squeezing process, which is crucial for reducing quantum noise in the detector. The lock loss mentioned could have been influenced by changes in OPO temperature, although an earthquake was also noted at the same time.

### Alterations to Particular Sensors from ALOG Dataset 2

1. **Adjustment of SQZ OPO Temperature**
   - Description: The squeezing OPO temperature was adjusted to optimize performance after noticing degradation in certain output channels.
   - Changing the OPO temperature affects how light interacts within the OPO, which is critical for the generation of squeezed light used to enhance the detector's sensitivity. Proper adjustment can restore optimal performance but needs careful monitoring.

2. **PMC Lock and FSS Lock Duration Update**
   - Description: The PMC and FSS (Frequency Stabilization System) lock statuses, including details on how long these systems have been locked and their current operating conditions, were updated.
   - Keeping these systems properly locked is crucial for maintaining the stability of the laser frequency and the overall integrity of the laser beam's path through the interferometer.

These entries in the ALOG dataset illustrate ongoing adjustments and monitoring required to maintain the delicate balance of the LIGO detectors' highly sensitive equipment. Each adjustment or unresolved issue could potentially impact the quality and sensitivity of gravitational wave detection.
