### Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors in ALOG Dataset 2

1. **High Microseism Impact on Lock Loss**:
   - **Issue**: The dataset reports frequent lock losses due to unusually high microseism levels. High microseism means that ground movements (like small vibrations or shakes), which are typically caused by natural activities such as ocean waves or other geological movements, are affecting the stability and function of the LIGO instruments, making it difficult to maintain a stable lock on the interferometer's laser beams.

2. **Squeezer Issues During Beckhoff Restart**:
   - **Issue**: Following a restart of the Beckhoff system, there were issues with the squeezer only achieving about 2dB of squeezing. The OPO (Optical Parametric Oscillator) temperature was found altered, affecting the squeezing level. The squeezer is a crucial component in enhancing the sensitivity of LIGO by reducing quantum noise. Any misconfiguration or operational issue post-restart can lead to suboptimal sensitivity and data quality.

### Alterations to Particular Sensors in ALOG Dataset 2

1. **Modification of Laser Safety Status**:
   - **Alteration**: The Y end VEA (Vacuum Equipment Area) transitioned from Laser Hazard to Level I Laser Safe and back as necessary for PCAL (Photon Calibrator) work. This involved modifications in the safety protocols and adjustments in the laser operations to ensure safe working conditions when conducting sensitive calibration procedures.

2. **Adjustments in OMC Dither Alignment**:
   - **Alteration**: Post an equipment update, the OMC (Output Mode Cleaner) dither alignment did not function correctly in single bounce, indicating potential issues with alignment stability. The dither alignment is a process where slight, controlled movements are applied to the OMC to optimize the laser beam's path through it, crucial for maintaining the interferometer's sensitivity.

3. **PCAL Power Sensor Responsivity Measurement**:
   - **Alteration**: Measurements were conducted to determine the responsivity of the PCAL power sensors at the Y-end, a critical component for calibrating the photon pressure exerted by the calibrators on the test masses. Adjustments and recalibrations like these are vital for ensuring the accuracy of the displacement measurements caused by gravitational waves.
