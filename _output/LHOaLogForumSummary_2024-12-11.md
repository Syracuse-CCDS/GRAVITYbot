**Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors in ALOG Dataset 2:**

1. **ALSX Crystal Frequency Issues:**
   - The ALSX (Advanced LIGO Seismic Excitation) crystal frequency was problematic, potentially due to environmental temperature changes affecting the crystal's performance. This is inferred from the connection made between changes in the EX VEA (End X Vacuum Equipment Area) temperatures and issues with crystal frequency, especially during wind influence.

2. **SQZ PMC Locking Issues:**
   - The SQZ (squeezer) PMC (Power Management Controller) had issues locking, possibly related to PZT (Piezoelectric Transducer) volt glitches or failures, which prevented changes in voltage necessary for proper operation. This led to operational disruptions as the system could not maintain its required state without manual intervention.

**Alterations to Particular Sensors in ALOG Dataset 2:**

1. **Change in TCSY Chiller Flow Rate:**
   - The flow of the TCSY (Thermal Compensation System Y-arm) chiller was adjusted from 0gpm (gallons per minute) to 7gpm. This adjustment was made despite concerns about running below the minimum recommended flow rate of 8gpm, highlighting attention to the chiller's operational guidelines that impact the system’s thermal stability.

2. **Introduction of Adjustable SMA Fiber Collimator in HWS:**
   - An adjustable SMA (SubMiniature version A) fiber collimator was installed on the 50um fiber for the ETMX (End Test Mass X) HWS (Hartmann Wavefront Sensor) fiber-coupled LED source. This adjustment improved the beam size, which is crucial for precise measurements and alignments in laser interferometry.
