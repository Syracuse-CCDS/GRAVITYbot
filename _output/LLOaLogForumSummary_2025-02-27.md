### Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors in ALOG Dataset 2

1. **Issue with GDS CALIB STRAIN not visible:**
   - Joe H reported that the GDS CALIB STRAIN, an important sensor reading for measuring strain due to gravitational waves, was not visible in the control room. This is critical because it impacts the ability to observe and analyze gravitational waves.

2. **Sensor Change Not Reported (TEIG Yucatan Sensor):**
   - A sensor in the Yucatan Peninsula was updated to a different data rate without notification, which affected the accuracy of the data aggregation. This could potentially introduce errors in the data used for seismic monitoring at LIGO.

### Alterations to Particular Sensors in ALOG Dataset 2

1. **Rotation of the ADF Demodulation Angle:**
   - The ADF (Amplitude Demodulation Feedback) demodulation angle was adjusted by 45 degrees. This adjustment is critical as it impacts the calibration and the accuracy of the data derived from the ADF system, which in turn influences the overall performance of the gravitational wave observation.

2. **OM1P Dither Line Moved to 1Hz:**
   - The OM1P dither line setting, which is part of the control system used to stabilize the optical modulation, was moved to 1Hz. This alteration is significant as it directly impacts the control and stability of optical systems within LIGO, thereby affecting the quality and reliability of gravitational wave measurements.

These specific entries highlight the ongoing adjustments and challenges faced in maintaining the precise instrumentation necessary for LIGO's operations. Each piece of equipment or sensor must be carefully calibrated and maintained to ensure the integrity of the data collected for gravitational wave research.
