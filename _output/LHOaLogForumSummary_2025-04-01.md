1. **Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors:**

   - **Mismatch in OSEM calibration:** 
     - Issue: There is a potential mismatch in calibration of the Optical Sensing Electromagnet (OSEM), which is a device used to monitor the position and alignment of the mirrors in LIGO. The mismatch could be due to approximating the whitening stage's frequency response incorrectly.

   - **BSC Sensor Glitch:**
     - Issue: The Beam Splitter Chamber (BSC) experienced a sensor glitch that triggered an alarm. This was resolved by restarting the service, but it highlights an ongoing sensitivity or instability in the sensor system.

   - **FSS PZT MON Oscillation:**
     - Issue: The Frequency Stabilization Servo (FSS), which helps maintain the laser frequency stability, had an oscillation in the Piezoelectric Transducer (PZT) monitor. This issue was temporarily resolved by toggling the autolocker, but the root cause of the oscillation might still need further investigation.

2. **Alterations to Particular Sensors:**

   - **POP Gain Changes:**
     - Alteration: The gain settings for the Photodiode Output Power (POP) were altered to address difficulties in locking the Differential Mode Receiver Input (DRMI). The changes involve adjusting the gain within the trigger matrix to improve the control and stability of the system.

   - **FSS Autolocker Toggling:**
     - Alteration: The FSS autolocker was toggled off and on to stabilize the Frequency Stabilization Servo after it showed erratic behavior. This helped in re-establishing the lock of the interferometer's master laser.
