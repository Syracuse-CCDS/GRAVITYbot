### Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors

1. **ALS Y PLL Spontaneous Lock State Changes**:
   - The Automatic Laser System (ALS) Y-axis Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) was experiencing spontaneous jumps from a stable locked state into a Ramp Gain state, which was not expected and caused lock loss. This issue intermittently forced the system out of the locked state without a clear cause, disrupting the observation process.

2. **DRMI Locking Difficulties**:
   - The Dual Recycled Michelson Interferometer (DRMI) had persistent issues with achieving and maintaining a lock, characterized by poor alignment signals and unresponsive control when attempting to lock. This problem was significant because it prevented stable observations from being conducted.

### Alterations to Particular Sensors

1. **Adjustment of the ALS Y PLL Threshold**:
   - To address the issue of the ALS Y PLL entering a Ramp Gain state, the threshold for the ALS Y LASER IR DC Power was adjusted slightly by 0.2mW to provide more stability and prevent unintended transitions to a fault state. This adjustment was an attempt to stabilize the system and reduce the frequency of lock losses.

2. **Increase of Gain in H LSC POPAIR B RF I/Q GAIN**:
   - Due to difficulties with DRMI locking, the gain for the POPAIR B RF I/Q channels was increased from 15 to 18 in an attempt to improve the detection and control signals used in locking DRMI. This change was intended to enhance the responsiveness of the system to control inputs, potentially alleviating some of the locking challenges.

These adjustments and ongoing issues highlight the complex nature of maintaining and calibrating the sensitive equipment used in LIGO's interferometers. Each change or unresolved issue can significantly impact the observatory's ability to detect gravitational waves, underscoring the importance of continuous monitoring and adjustment.
