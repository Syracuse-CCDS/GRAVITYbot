1. **New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2:**
   - **Invisible Violins**: This proposed glitch class is discussed as not visually standing out in spectral images but is identified based on their specific frequency characteristics tied to known violin modes. The glitches are named "Invisible Violins" due to their subtle presence yet detectable influence within specific frequency bands.

2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**
   - **Scattered Light Variants**: Participants in Talk Dataset 2 express concerns that the Scattered Light class may need updating. There are observations that the current examples of Scattered Light no longer prominently feature arches as they used to, suggesting a possible change in the characteristics of this glitch type over time.

3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science:**
   - Participants in Talk Dataset 2 show a keen interest in understanding how to differentiate between similar-looking glitches and seek to refine their classification skills. For instance, questions arise about whether a specific pattern is a "weird blip/chirp shape" due to coarse time resolution, indicating a deeper dive into how data resolution affects glitch appearance.
   - There is curiosity about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their role in glitch classification, reflecting a desire to understand the automated systems that assist in classifying vast amounts of gravitational wave data.
   - Users are also inquiring about the process to update categories within the LIGO data system, reflecting an eagerness to understand and potentially improve the classification frameworks used in gravitational wave research.

4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins:**
   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a detailed hypothesis concerning glitches like "Invisible Violins", suggesting they may arise due to specific operational conditions of the detectors, especially relating to the violin modes of the suspension fibers of the test masses. This hypothesis relies on understanding the mechanical resonances and their interaction with laser frequencies within LIGO.

5. **Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels:**
   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are discussions about whether glitches are specifically related to certain sensors or channels at the LIGO observatories. For example, questions arise about the PEM beamtube accelerometer aux channels and their readings, indicating an interest in how specific components of the detector setup contribute to recorded data and potential glitches.
