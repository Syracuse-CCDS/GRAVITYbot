### Novel Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2

1. **Crown Glitch**: In Talk Dataset 2, there is a mention of a new glitch class called the "Crown" glitch. This glitch is described as a fast scattering glitch where stray light is reflected by the edge of a large cylindrical baffle vibrating at a high rate and modulated by slower pendulum motions of one of the test mass suspensions. This glitch class emerged during observations and was previously unclassified, signifying active and evolving categorization by the citizen scientists.
