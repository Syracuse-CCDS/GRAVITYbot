**1. Unresolved issues related to particular sensors:**

- **Pressure Spikes in the X arm:** There was an observation of pressure spikes specifically in the X arm that correlated with a lock loss event. This was an isolated incident within a two-month period, indicating a potentially unusual or unresolved issue.
  - **Plain Language Explanation:** A sudden increase in pressure was detected in one part of the detector (X arm) just when the instrument lost its ability to observe gravitational waves, suggesting a possible link between the two events. This kind of spike hadn't been seen in the past two months, making it an unusual and unresolved issue.

**2. Alterations to particular sensors:**

- **ADC Swapping due to Timeout Errors:** An Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) was swapped out after persistent timeout errors that disrupted the functioning of the system. This hardware change was necessary to maintain the operation of the interferometer.
  - **Plain Language Explanation:** Part of the electronic system that converts analog signals to digital data was malfunctioning frequently, causing system errors. The problematic part was replaced to ensure the system could continue to operate correctly.

Both of these points reflect critical maintenance and troubleshooting efforts that are part of regular operations at LIGO to ensure the observatory remains sensitive and capable of detecting gravitational waves.
