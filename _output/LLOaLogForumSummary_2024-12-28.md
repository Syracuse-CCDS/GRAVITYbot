### Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors (ALOG Dataset 2)
1. **Fire Alarm System Fault at Y End Station:**
   - Incident: An "Unknown Alarm Fire Protocol" was triggered without any visible signs of fire. The alarm system showed simultaneous troubles across multiple zones, indicating a failure.
   - Explanation: The fire alarm system appeared to malfunction, showing multiple fault signals without actual fire conditions. This caused unnecessary dispatch of the fire department. The panel was identified to have a failure and was set for service.

2. **Violin Modes Exceeding Thresholds:**
   - Incident: ITMY mode exceeded the guardian threshold for damping, leading to the engagement of specific filters for control.
   - Explanation: Violin modes, which are oscillations in the mirror suspensions, exceeded safe operational thresholds causing the system to apply filters to dampen these vibrations. Such events can affect the sensitivity and stability of the observatory.

### Alterations to Particular Sensors (ALOG Dataset 2)
1. **Adjustment to SQZ Phase Angle:**
   - Alteration: The squeezing (SQZ) phase angle was adjusted slightly to improve the detection range and squeezing level.
   - Explanation: Squeezing technology is used to reduce quantum noise in measurements. Adjusting the phase angle of the squeezing can enhance the observatory's sensitivity. This adjustment led to an improvement in both the squeezing level and the detection range.

2. **Damping Violin Modes specifically ITMY Mode:**
   - Alteration: Specific filters were applied to control excessive vibrations in the ITMY mode.
   - Explanation: Violin modes, particularly in the ITMY suspension system, were excessively active, requiring the application of damping filters. These filters help to stabilize the system by reducing unwanted oscillations.
