### Unresolved Issues Related to Particular Sensors:
1. **SQZ Angle Servo Railing Issue**:
   - The SQZ angle servo kept "railing", which means it was repeatedly hitting its operational limits, causing operational disturbances. This issue appeared unresolved as the servo was adjusted multiple times but continued to show the same behavior, impacting the observatory's ability to maintain optimal functioning.

2. **SQZ Angle Servo Railing Continued Issue**:
   - Continuing from the previous issue, the SQZ angle servo continued to rail and did not fix itself promptly. This resulted in a prolonged period where the system operated at sub-optimal levels, impacting data quality and system stability.

### Alterations to Particular Sensors:
1. **Adjustment of SQZ ADF Phase Servo**:
   - The ADF (Automatic Delay Feedback) SQZ (squeezing) phase servo underwent adjustments to its cabling and settings. This change aimed to optimize the phase settings due to issues with thermalization changes affecting the servo's performance. Although adjustments were made, it was not clear if these fully resolved the underlying issues.

2. **Optical Lever Piers CPY Alignment Reset**:
   - The optical lever piers underwent a reset to their alignment, specifically the CPY measurements, to ensure that the equipment was correctly aligned for precise measurements. This adjustment was crucial for maintaining the accuracy of experiments and measurements conducted at the facility.
