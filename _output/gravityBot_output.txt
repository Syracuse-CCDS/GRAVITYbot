User Prompt: 
    For the following text data, provide a list of primary topics of the data:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst? Maybe even a combination of glitches? maybe #scatteredlight :)
Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

    For the following text data, provide a list of primary topics of the data:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst? Maybe even a combination of glitches? maybe #scatteredlight :)
Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with

- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

User Prompt: 
    For the following text data, provide a list of primary topics of the data:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst? Maybe even a combination of glitches? maybe #scatteredlight :)
Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk762917436 and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these glitches that isnt well understood yet Youre very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now Hanford Fireballish with

regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organprojectszooniversegravityspycollectionszngabitantloudblipgroupsymmetricwithkoigrandorgan Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicm25 has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450189 looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450234 looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450218 firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame

often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other

arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening 50324234 frame

together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency

recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm25 The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nicm25 I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy

repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk762917436 and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these glitches that isnt well understood yet Youre very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now Hanford Fireballish with

regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organprojectszooniversegravityspycollectionszngabitantloudblipgroupsymmetricwithkoigrandorgan Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicm25 has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450189 looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450234 looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450218 firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame

often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other

arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening 50324234 frame

together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency

recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm25 The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nicm25 I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

     The time is going in reverse I think that's worthy of studying charmed quark meson https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3361346/ possible Hz harmonic? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3360624/ maybe koifish and off center flag typical offset glitch https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3361346/ random outlier at 120Hz not blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3361490/ it's a chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3273036/ Looks to me like a gathering of three separate independent glitches A not very large blip at time seconds washed out by the high Q processing scattered light archlets around Hz coming and going and varying a bit in frequencies as usual and an intermittent feature reported at just under Hz which triggered the subject https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3360624/ The upper glitch is a blip but the lower ones the quieter W shape between and the medium shape between and and the louder A shape between and don't look like any other glitch types https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3361692/ Thanks agreed https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3360624/ chirp with coincident blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3361793/ Not sure if the loud glitch below 16Hz is a low frequency line or scattered light given the quiet bits from through ish There does seem to be a quiet ripple comb above it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3361831/ This is a series of descending koi fish or very closely spaced blips ending with the one centered around the point It's also quite scratchy above There are what look like quieter fire balls around https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3361852/ Not sure if this should be a low frequency blip or wheat grass with a very loud spike around the which triggered this subject https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3361860/ Looks like a collection of pine trees rather than koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362003/ for me a chirp too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3359859/ Looks like wheat grass with two louder stalks centered around or repeating low frequency blips but lean to wheat grass because of the quieter features filling the rest of frame https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362094/ Agreed! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362094/ The Machine Learning part of Gravity Spy thinks of this and similar subjects as Low Frequency Lines based on how it had been trained in the past But they aren't "lines" in the spectral line sense tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk They are high Q renderings of very low frequency Scattered Light arches cut off below either by the Hz bottom edge or already at Hz by always very loud background noise and cut off above by ever present loud background noise in the Hz band The background noise gets suppressed in our images At Livingston during O4a and O4b so far such very low frequency glitches account for more subjects than everything else put together which isn't quite obvious when classifying them here on Zooniverse due to the peculiar ways how subjects get distributed across the workflow levels From the point of view of how they are caused I've been leaning towards calling them Scattered Light From a practical point of view however it might make sense to keep them separate from Scattered Light glitches that rise above the Hz noise band into the Hz region where they do more harm to clean observing time than down there near the bottom edge even though it's one kind of glitch caused by one and the same kind of mechanism just a difference in how fast the reflecting item was moving at the time Our current classification scheme doesn't capture these aspects very well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3361831/ NOTA unknown 60Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362310/ "NotNoGlitch" There had to be noise at least a factor of above the background in order to trigger a Gravity Spy subject and extracting these data for the present S with the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search we find an SNR of peak frequency Hz and duration of seconds as recorded by the glitch detection software Omicron So this is really going to be very low frequency Scattered Light but the Hz bottom edge of our images is dark purple Now that is a hint that something even louder must have been happening either before or usually afterwards so it's worth checking also the approximate time after UTC from the hours wide rectangle centered on it as displayed by a Sim Search asking for a single result and then heading to the logbook tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG and the status summary pages tab https gwosc org detector status The status page for tab https gwosc org detector status day includes a plot of the observing segments on that date !

    Now consider Talk Dataset 2:
     Extremely loud but interesting due to the loud high frequency static https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ A ripple comb with some interesting shapes that are louder than the rest including the squashed at the and the paired lines between and https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365862/ Well observed and an interesting example ! Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367332/ It looks like repeating blips going into a koi fish though the blips might be a wheatgrass glitch instead given they seem to be joined together Also the parentheses around the koi fish are interesting https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/ Could be a really wide ripple comb or a series of subtle scattered light over a wide frequency band that seems to be descending in frequency along the leading edge https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/ is this still koi fish? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/ Looks like a ripple comb coming to a end louder than the earlier part of the comb shown https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/ Scattered Light and more Scattered Light these are two successive stacks of parallel arches each with the top of a lower arch around Hz and a "cap" or "eyebrow" arch above it around Hz Usually such stacks are caused by the same stray light path being traversed more than once With each additional roundtrip the rate of change of the total path length traversed expressed as number of laser wavelengths per second and thus giving the frequency at which the noise will show up increases by a similar amount https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367332/ Good question I'm not sure what to make of this It's either a single group or "flock" lasting about seconds and ending with a smallish Koi Fish or a flock of blips lasting only seconds centered around time seconds followed by a separate smallish Koi Fish by coincidence https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/ A bit of a head scratcher thinking The central Koi Fish may be part of the flock of blips that starts around time seconds or else it might be an independent glitch appearing next to it by sheer coincidence Either way the parentheses are part of the Koi's "fins" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/ Another nice example from this lot tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Plus a little stack of scattered light archlets around time seconds unusually neatly shaped as Hanford O scattered light goes which often looks rather messier Sometimes it's much easier to assign a glitch to a population taking into account when it had happened and what else had been happening around the same time and then the entire population to a proposed class than to classify each individual subject separately especially when as in this case the individual examples show quite a lot of variability https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/ I would file this under moderately messy Scattered Light Hanford O style By the time late November the present S got recorded the medium frequency ripple comb glitches that had been common from mid July onwards had become rare again at Hanford For comparison here's a late MF ripple S from October fourth frames of the two subjects side by side both rendered at Q ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location f 733d 42da 8b 097033091dc png ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 7f a c a 4ff c 20354 f dd png The differences can be subtle The ripples tend ed to last much longer than four seconds at a time we usually see only pieces of them Hanford O Scattered Light features at typically slightly lower frequencies usually form shorter groups each group lasting about seconds Only on a few exceptional days did they continue beyond both the left and right edges The Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search also helps here The MF ripples almost always have peak frequencies near or or or Hz Scattered Light glitches mostly live at somewhat lower frequencies and once they manage to rise above the Hz background noise band they do not prefer any particular narrow frequency bands since the frequencies at which they show up are dictated by how fast the reflecting item is moving at any given moment which varies on a continuous scale https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/

    Below are a list of things I would like an answer for. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

This class is suggested due to the observed patterns that resemble a grouping or cluster of similar glitch shapes, termed "blips," which seem to occur in a sequence or batch. This collective appearance suggests a distinctive class that might warrant separate categorization from individual blips due to its nature and the possible underlying causes that lead to such clustered appearances.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n**Answer 2: Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes**\n\nIn Talk Dataset 2, there is a noticeable questioning regarding the classification adequacy of certain glitches. For instance, there\'s a discussion about whether certain observed phenomena should be classified as "wheat grass" or another class due to the appearance of a glitch that looks like a koi fish made of smaller koi fish. This reflects a broader concern about whether existing classifications comprehensively cover the spectrum of observed glitches or if they need refinement to accommodate new observations.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/\n\n**Answer 3: Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects**\n\nIn Talk Dataset 2, questions arise about the nature of some glitches and their classification. For instance, there\'s a query whether a particular pattern forms part of a "flock of blips" or if it stands as an independent glitch. This questioning goes deeper into understanding the categorization rules and characteristics that define different glitch classes, reflecting an ongoing learning process about the granularity and distinctions between different types of glitches.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n**Answer 4: Hypotheses About Glitch Origins**\n\nTalk Dataset 2 contains specific hypotheses concerning the origins of glitches. Several discussions hypothesize environmental factors impacting the sensors, such as external vibrations from seismic activity potentially causing locklosses and influencing the glitches observed. For instance, an earthquake near Tonga discussed might have caused specific glitches due to seismic waves influencing the detector.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362604/\n\n**Answer 5: Questions Concerning Connections to Sensors or Channels**\n\nThere\'s a discussion in Talk Dataset 2 about whether the observed glitches, specifically the categories and shapes like "scattered light," are linked to particular sensors or channels, especially when they resemble shapes or patterns known to be caused by specific sensor actions or malfunctions. This includes wondering about the impact of sensor changes and configurations, like the shift from ETMY to ETMX, which could influence the types and appearances of glitches observed.\n\n- URL related to response: httpsid: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1720383892, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_486730399b', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=642, prompt_tokens=5281, total_tokens=5923))
