User Prompt: 
    For the following text data, provide a list of primary topics of the data:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst? Maybe even a combination of glitches? maybe #scatteredlight :)
Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

    For the following text data, provide a list of primary topics of the data:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst? Maybe even a combination of glitches? maybe #scatteredlight :)
Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with

- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

User Prompt: 
    For the following text data, provide a list of primary topics of the data:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst? Maybe even a combination of glitches? maybe #scatteredlight :)
Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk762917436 and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these glitches that isnt well understood yet Youre very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now Hanford Fireballish with

regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organprojectszooniversegravityspycollectionszngabitantloudblipgroupsymmetricwithkoigrandorgan Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicm25 has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450189 looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450234 looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450218 firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame

often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other

arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening 50324234 frame

together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency

recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm25 The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nicm25 I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy

repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk762917436 and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these glitches that isnt well understood yet Youre very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now Hanford Fireballish with

regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organprojectszooniversegravityspycollectionszngabitantloudblipgroupsymmetricwithkoigrandorgan Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicm25 has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450189 looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450234 looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450218 firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame

often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other

arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening 50324234 frame

together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency

recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm25 The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nicm25 I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362094/ The Machine Learning part of Gravity Spy thinks of this and similar subjects as Low Frequency Lines based on how it had been trained in the past But they aren't "lines" in the spectral line sense tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk They are high Q renderings of very low frequency Scattered Light arches cut off below either by the Hz bottom edge or already at Hz by always very loud background noise and cut off above by ever present loud background noise in the Hz band The background noise gets suppressed in our images At Livingston during O4a and O4b so far such very low frequency glitches account for more subjects than everything else put together which isn't quite obvious when classifying them here on Zooniverse due to the peculiar ways how subjects get distributed across the workflow levels From the point of view of how they are caused I've been leaning towards calling them Scattered Light From a practical point of view however it might make sense to keep them separate from Scattered Light glitches that rise above the Hz noise band into the Hz region where they do more harm to clean observing time than down there near the bottom edge even though it's one kind of glitch caused by one and the same kind of mechanism just a difference in how fast the reflecting item was moving at the time Our current classification scheme doesn't capture these aspects very well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3361831/ NOTA unknown 60Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362310/ "NotNoGlitch" There had to be noise at least a factor of above the background in order to trigger a Gravity Spy subject and extracting these data for the present S with the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search we find an SNR of peak frequency Hz and duration of seconds as recorded by the glitch detection software Omicron So this is really going to be very low frequency Scattered Light but the Hz bottom edge of our images is dark purple Now that is a hint that something even louder must have been happening either before or usually afterwards so it's worth checking also the approximate time after UTC from the hours wide rectangle centered on it as displayed by a Sim Search asking for a single result and then heading to the logbook tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG and the status summary pages tab https gwosc org detector status The status page for tab https gwosc org detector status day includes a plot of the observing segments on that date !

    Now consider Talk Dataset 2:
     Extremely loud but interesting due to the loud high frequency static https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ A ripple comb with some interesting shapes that are louder than the rest including the squashed at the and the paired lines between and https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365862/ Well observed and an interesting example ! Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367332/ It looks like repeating blips going into a koi fish though the blips might be a wheatgrass glitch instead given they seem to be joined together Also the parentheses around the koi fish are interesting https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/ Could be a really wide ripple comb or a series of subtle scattered light over a wide frequency band that seems to be descending in frequency along the leading edge https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/ is this still koi fish? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/ Looks like a ripple comb coming to a end louder than the earlier part of the comb shown https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/ Scattered Light and more Scattered Light these are two successive stacks of parallel arches each with the top of a lower arch around Hz and a "cap" or "eyebrow" arch above it around Hz Usually such stacks are caused by the same stray light path being traversed more than once With each additional roundtrip the rate of change of the total path length traversed expressed as number of laser wavelengths per second and thus giving the frequency at which the noise will show up increases by a similar amount https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367332/ Good question I'm not sure what to make of this It's either a single group or "flock" lasting about seconds and ending with a smallish Koi Fish or a flock of blips lasting only seconds centered around time seconds followed by a separate smallish Koi Fish by coincidence https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/ A bit of a head scratcher thinking The central Koi Fish may be part of the flock of blips that starts around time seconds or else it might be an independent glitch appearing next to it by sheer coincidence Either way the parentheses are part of the Koi's "fins" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/ Another nice example from this lot tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Plus a little stack of scattered light archlets around time seconds unusually neatly shaped as Hanford O scattered light goes which often looks rather messier Sometimes it's much easier to assign a glitch to a population taking into account when it had happened and what else had been happening around the same time and then the entire population to a proposed class than to classify each individual subject separately especially when as in this case the individual examples show quite a lot of variability https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/ I would file this under moderately messy Scattered Light Hanford O style By the time late November the present S got recorded the medium frequency ripple comb glitches that had been common from mid July onwards had become rare again at Hanford For comparison here's a late MF ripple S from October fourth frames of the two subjects side by side both rendered at Q ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location f 733d 42da 8b 097033091dc png ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 7f a c a 4ff c 20354 f dd png The differences can be subtle The ripples tend ed to last much longer than four seconds at a time we usually see only pieces of them Hanford O Scattered Light features at typically slightly lower frequencies usually form shorter groups each group lasting about seconds Only on a few exceptional days did they continue beyond both the left and right edges The Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search also helps here The MF ripples almost always have peak frequencies near or or or Hz Scattered Light glitches mostly live at somewhat lower frequencies and once they manage to rise above the Hz background noise band they do not prefer any particular narrow frequency bands since the frequencies at which they show up are dictated by how fast the reflecting item is moving at any given moment which varies on a continuous scale https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/

    - 1400 Ripple 
    - 70 Hz Line 
    - Air Compressor (50 Hz)
    - Blip

    - Tomte 
    - Uncategorized_Glitches 
    - Violin Mode Harmonic 
    - Wandering Line 
    - Whistle 

    Below are a list of things I would like an answer for. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

This class is suggested due to the observed patterns that resemble a grouping or cluster of similar glitch shapes, termed "blips," which seem to occur in a sequence or batch. This collective appearance suggests a distinctive class that might warrant separate categorization from individual blips due to its nature and the possible underlying causes that lead to such clustered appearances.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n**Answer 2: Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes**\n\nIn Talk Dataset 2, there is a noticeable questioning regarding the classification adequacy of certain glitches. For instance, there\'s a discussion about whether certain observed phenomena should be classified as "wheat grass" or another class due to the appearance of a glitch that looks like a koi fish made of smaller koi fish. This reflects a broader concern about whether existing classifications comprehensively cover the spectrum of observed glitches or if they need refinement to accommodate new observations.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/\n\n**Answer 3: Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects**\n\nIn Talk Dataset 2, questions arise about the nature of some glitches and their classification. For instance, there\'s a query whether a particular pattern forms part of a "flock of blips" or if it stands as an independent glitch. This questioning goes deeper into understanding the categorization rules and characteristics that define different glitch classes, reflecting an ongoing learning process about the granularity and distinctions between different types of glitches.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n**Answer 4: Hypotheses About Glitch Origins**\n\nTalk Dataset 2 contains specific hypotheses concerning the origins of glitches. Several discussions hypothesize environmental factors impacting the sensors, such as external vibrations from seismic activity potentially causing locklosses and influencing the glitches observed. For instance, an earthquake near Tonga discussed might have caused specific glitches due to seismic waves influencing the detector.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362604/\n\n**Answer 5: Questions Concerning Connections to Sensors or Channels**\n\nThere\'s a discussion in Talk Dataset 2 about whether the observed glitches, specifically the categories and shapes like "scattered light," are linked to particular sensors or channels, especially when they resemble shapes or patterns known to be caused by specific sensor actions or malfunctions. This includes wondering about the impact of sensor changes and configurations, like the shift from ETMY to ETMX, which could influence the types and appearances of glitches observed.\n\n- URL related to response: httpsid: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1720383892, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_486730399b', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=642, prompt_tokens=5281, total_tokens=5923))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    Below are a list of things I would like an answer for. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

     Extremely loud but interesting due to the loud high frequency static https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ A ripple comb with some interesting shapes that are louder than the rest including the squashed at the and the paired lines between and https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365862/ Well observed and an interesting example ! Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    Below are a list of things I would like an answer for. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

They describe this as a group or "flock" lasting about 10 seconds and ending with a smallish Koi Fish, or as a separate event consisting of a flock of blips lasting only 4 seconds. This description suggests a distinct pattern or clustering of blips, differentiating it from other known classes.\n   - URLs: \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - Citizen scientists express concerns about the general categorization and the effectiveness of the machine learning (ML) in accurately capturing the essence of certain glitches. They discuss the limitations of ML classifications in dealing with new or nuanced types of glitches. They suggest that some glitches might span multiple classifications or not fit neatly into existing ones based on their observed characteristics and behaviors.\n   - URLs:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are emerging questions about whether certain observed patterns are independent glitches or part of a larger, connected event. For example, discussions around whether a central Koi Fish is part of a flock of blips or an independent glitch signify an inquiry into the connectivity and interaction of different glitch types.\n   - URLs:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Citizen scientists hypothesize that the visible frequency band of glitches might be influenced by environmental conditions like seismic activities or operational changes in the interferometers. For instance, they correlate a lockloss event and subsequent glitches with an earthquake in Mexico, analyzing how external seismic activities could induce specific glitches.\n   - Another hypothesis revolves around operational adjustments, such as changes in actuation at the Livingston observatory, potentially causing a regular pattern of glitches seen as "flock of blips."\n   - URLs:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Connection of Glitches to Specific Sensors or Channels:**\n   - Discussions in Talk Dataset 2 involve examining the relationship between glitches and specific operational changes or sensor states at observatories.

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

One notable mention is a glitch described as resembling "a koi fish made of koi fish," which suggests a recursive or self-similar structure in the glitch appearance. This description indicates an observed pattern that combines known glitch types into a potentially new, composite form. Similarly, discussions around "cuneiform type loud glitch" and "extremely wide ripple comb" suggest observations of unique spectral patterns which are not clearly classified under existing categories. These discussions showcase the citizen scientists\' active engagement in refining glitch classification based on emergent data.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367332/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a noticeable discussion about the uncertainty in categorizing certain glitches, such as whether a specific pattern should be classified as "low frequency blip" or "wheat grass." This indicates ongoing challenges and potential confusion in applying existing glitch classes accurately to observed data. The discussion suggests that existing classifications might not fully encompass the variability or nuances of observed glitch patterns, leading to uncertainty among citizen scientists.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions on Technical Aspects and Classifications:**\n   - Talk Dataset 2 includes queries about the detailed structures within observed glitches. For instance, questions about whether certain features in a glitch are part of a larger group or independent phenomena highlight a deeper dive into understanding the intricate details of glitch morphology. Such questions reflect a growing sophistication in the citizen scientists\' approach to data analysis, focusing on the interrelations and individual characteristics of glitch components.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/\n\n4. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Participants in Talk Dataset 2 hypothesize about the environmental and operational context of glitches. For instance, links between specific glitches and external events like earthquakes are explored, suggesting a direct correlation between environmental disturbances and glitch occurrences. This analysis is grounded in real-time events affecting the sensor\'s operational environment, thereby providing a contextual understanding of glitch origins.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Questions and Thoughts in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Dataset 2, there is a discussion about the potential impact of changes in sensor configurations on the observation of glitches. For example, changes in the DARM ESD actuation are speculated to influence the visibility and characteristics of glitches. This illustrates the participants\' engagement with understanding how specific technical adjustments in LIGO\'s sensor setup might affect data acquisition and glitch characteristics.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3219652/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1720393647, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_486730399b', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=837, prompt_tokens=5300, total_tokens=6137))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The description focuses on the grouped, transient nature of these glitches, suggesting a collective rather than isolated appearance in the spectrogram data. The term emphasizes the visual and possibly dynamic character of these glitches as a coherent group.\n   - **"Ripple Comb"**: This new class is proposed to describe glitches characterized by repetitive, wave-like patterns that resemble the teeth of a comb. This glitch class emphasizes the structured, periodic nature of the disturbance, potentially indicative of a repetitive or oscillatory underlying cause.\n   - URLs influencing response: \n     - Flock of Blips: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n     - Ripple Comb: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is an ongoing discussion about the appropriateness of classifying certain glitches under existing categories like "Scattered Light" and "Koi Fish". Participants express uncertainties about whether these classifications accurately capture the characteristics of the glitches observed. For example, they debate if a pattern should be classified as "Koi Fish" or merely a variation of "Wheat Grass", suggesting a need for clearer or more distinct classification criteria.\n   - URLs influencing response: \n     - Concerns on Scattered Light and Koi Fish classifications: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects**\n   - Participants in Talk Dataset 2 raise questions about the consistency of glitch appearances and their classifications. For instance, they discuss the appearance of glitches resembling "Koi Fish" and whether these should be considered as an independent class or as a variant of another class due to their similar features to other glitches.\n   - There is curiosity about the methodological aspects of glitch classification, such as how machine learning models are trained to recognize and categorize glitches, and whether these models are sufficiently adaptable to newly observed glitch types.\n   - URLs influencing response:\n     - Questions on glitch classification consistency and methodology: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2**\n   - One hypothesis discussed concerns the environmental impact on glitch occurrences, specifically how natural events like earthquakes can cause significant disruptions in sensor readings, leading to identifiable glitches in the data.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

That one is currently a bit of a junkyard due to an unfortunate combination of reasons and it currently tends to be somewhat starved of submissions too These transients near Hz belong here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk This proposed glitch class was never turned into an official classification option These glitches had happened only during three consecutive days to at Hanford and the cause had already been fixed by the time the corresponding subjects were uploaded to Zooniverse a few days later The researches had therefore intended to retire all of the roughly subjects involved but this didn't turn out to be feasible So we still keep encountering them in level to be classified like much else in this level as None Of The Above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3380401/ Not unless they should occur again They clearly form a very distinct population but the minimum required for a formal glitch class proposal would be distinct subjects and we've seen and one of our veterans has collected tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections deleteduser 1795hz exactly of them Their cause is unknown they all come from Hanford from one week in late October See also this entry tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2961842?comment in the Early Alerts thread Around that time there were recurrent issues with uploading subjects simultaneously to Zooniverse and to the Gravity Spy tools tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu resulting in many partially failed uploads and many retries By the time this was sorted out each of these glitches hat got uploaded either five or six times to Zooniverse under different subject numbers so now there are more than subjects for them altogether It has not proved practical to eliminate the duplicates from the active subjects in the level workflow the present subject is one of them All we can do for now is classify all of them as None Of The Above and I've kept indicating the duplicates by putting them into a marker collection Those with subject numbers 9287xxxx 9289xxxx 9302xxxx 9327xxxx 9343xxxx are the extraneous ones where the uploads didn't fully succeed The good ones those which have become visible to the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search have 9636xxxx numbers https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3380403/ You will have noticed that the glitch mix that's been coming out of Advanced LIGO's fourth observing run O now into its second half O4b is rather different from anything we've ever seen before Blips and Koi Fish have remained recognizable with minor changes due to reduced stationary background noise Extremely Loud is still with us Violin Mode Harmonics have been seen a few times though most subjects caused by rung up violin modes look completely bland and can be recognized only by their peak frequencies in the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search combined with relevant logbook entries for the days in question On one occasion in January we've had a Wandering Line tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3275733?comment that can be traced along successive subjects for about minutes Gone we hope! are Whistles Gone are the splendid large multi arch Scattered Light subjects that were common during earlier runs the cause for them had been pinpointed in late and clever fixes applied in January before the end of O got rid of them The Field Guide Entry for Scattered Light links to a relevant paper Gone are Crowns Scattered Light is still causing the vast majority of glitches around but most of them now show up at very low frequencies and end up being classified as either Low Frequency Lines or Low Frequency Burst whereas genuine Low Frequency Lines tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are rare and don't look like much see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and genuine Low Frequency Bursts even rarer The Line absent during O may have returned or else some other cause is producing close lookalikes And all sorts of completely new things have been showing up in moderate numbers B Do keep an eye on the New Glitch Classes LIGO tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk board https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3380401/

     Well the Machine Learning has never yet been trained for these it was left to guess within the limits of its limited "imagination" But to be fair back in when the subjects from the earlier event were first showing up humans were equally mystified tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 415698?comment by them https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3370677/ After running cascaded similarity searches until my queue was exhausted I'm looking at so far subjects tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h b bike chain or hz from this heating episode I'm not sure about their chronological order in part because I can't limit the searches to O4b only but let me point out a few series of successively overlapping subjects before UTC ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 3345c 06de 4 c ec 84041 b png tab ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 28 cd adfa 48fb 9 a a png tab ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 2530 a f bec bf b png tab before ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location cae c 40c dd png tab ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location a 469d 893a 29 fd png tab around ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location b 4bdb 417d a f a png tab ! framr https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location dfe 25fd 91ea 962 bd png tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3129990/ Ah apologies to Machine Learning https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3370677/ Blip with a leading whistle type glitch leading into it centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383003/ Boot like low frequency blip centered at though it looks like it might be a part of a wheat grass Another glitch centered at which might have its own subject https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383006/ Perhaps an abnormally quiet lead up to lock loss starting at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383007/ Looks like a glimmering of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383011/ Three scattered light glitches with the suppressed band between 26Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383015/ A glimmering of koi fish or extremely loud https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383017/ Found this glitch similar to the Koi Fish glitch but in groups https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384386/ The glitch can look like it is neither a Blip nor Whistle but as time progresses it will narrow into a W shape classifying it as a Whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/224113/ It may look abnormal at first but as time progresses toward the next frames the glitch takes the form of a "W " classifying it as a whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/178209/ It takes the form of a "W" as time progresses in the next frames making it a whistle glitch with a very low normalized energy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/104145/ Although I believed it to be none of the forms I decided to finalize the classification of a koi fish due to the fact that it fits the criteria of a blip with fins wings even though the one on the right is abnormally large with higher normalized energy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/104202/ This one was tricky due to the fact that there is an abnormally large "fin" to the left with very high normalized energy but I would still classify it as a koi fish due to it meeting the criteria of being a Blip with fins wings even though one has significantly more normalized energy levels than the other https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384512/ Would there be such thing as a power line with a frequency below 60Hz? If that is possible for a glitch then I would classify it as that if not then it is possibly none of the mentioned glitch formats https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384515/ This looks like a 60Hz power line at a glance of the main glitch but it has high normalized energy in the frequencies below it as well I classified it as a power line but it could also be none of the above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384517/ I thought it was a blip at first but if you observe around the areas of the main glitch you can probably make out fins wings due to the faint normalized energy in those areas classifying it as a koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3302220/ I thought that there was no glitch at first but if you check the frames with the different time intervals you will notice the dots in the frequencies above Hz all in a vertical arrangement columns classifying it as a Violin Mode Harmonic https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/2327400/ This comment has been deleted https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/1160323/ It looks like a koi fish due to the fact that it meets the criteria of a sharp blip with fins wings If you look closely you can see the blip shape at time and the wings on the left and right sides even though they look abnormal due to the high normalized energy and weird shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/1160323/ Very very narrow "V " but it still classifies as a whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/122657/ This one is crazy it looks like there is barely any transition of normalized energy levels at around the Hz frequency like it has super high contrast To add on the fact of the weird spots at the frequencies above make this even more abnormal https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3284783/ I've seen lots of these before they always look like a power line with high normalized energy below the Hz frequency would these need new classification? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384528/ It is a scattered light because there is a faint glitch with high normalized energy at around frequency Hz and a very thick one at around frequency Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384535/ Double blip or a very very faint Koi fish? I could be wrong but I somewhat see the fins wings of the koi fish on the sides of the main blip at time 0s even though the one on the left has high normalized energy and the other has very very low normalized energy then again I could be wrong https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384536/ This is VERY similar to a power line but at very low frequency compared to the usual Hz it could classify as a power line or none of the above for me https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384538/ This looks like a very concentrated blip due to its high contrast with the normalized energy surrounding it with barely any transition from high to low https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3165364/ This may look like a very very low frequency power line but it is actually an energy burst when you move onto the more zoomed out frames with greater time intervals https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384541/ If you notice the low normalized energy line at around the frequency of Hz it may look like a high frequency line but I believe that it may be a different classification I can also see it kind of looking like a horizontal version of a violin mode harmonic but I could be wrong https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3280175/ This looks like a very long wide low frequency burst with other high normalized energy glitches in the surrounding area https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384544/ This somewhat looks like a lower frequency version of a power line https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384545/ This one looks super similar to Subject a high frequency glitch with long duration adn very low normalized energy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384547/ Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk JadenNino and thank you for contributing! Correct this is a Whistle from the first observing run in We've still had a number of Whistle glitches until the third observing run O but none yet during the ongoing fourth O O4b It's not necessary to annotate each and every subject we have far too many but please be welcome to bring up anything that's unusual or specially noteworthy or giving rise to questions! Over the years and after many upgrades to the observatories the glitch mix has changed a lot Some old glitch classes are no longer happening others have changed in appearance and completely new things are appearing now that still need investigating You'll meet quite a lot of None Of The Above as you advance through the workflows One more remark Time advances from left to right in each of our subject images The animation merely zooms out along the time axis from half a second shown in the first frame to showing four seconds' worth in the fourth frame https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/178209/ Yes this doesn't really want to fit into the available classes I would tend to calling it None Of The Above Glitches like this close irregularly spaced groups of blip like "glitchlets" with a well defined beginning and end have been happening for years but have never been very common so there isn't even a proposed glitch class yet for them They've been nicknamed flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384512/ Well noted Indeed it's not a Power Line It's quite close to Hz the noise distribution peaked at Hz It's part of a population of medium frequency glitches that first showed up in larger numbers at Hanford in mid July and since then they've gradually become rare again We have a pending glitch class proposal tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk for them The Machine Learning part of Gravity Spy did mistake this for a Power Line with high confidence At some point it will need to be retrained to recognize all the new sorts of glitches from recent years but a lot of work is still needed in this direction it will need to be done in such a way that the LIGO engineers afterwards will still be able to compare recent Machine Learning classifications to older ones from past years https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384515/ Good points! I had run into this subject almost a year ago scratched my head for a bit and settled on NOTA but now that I look at it again it could be a fringe case of a Power Line possibly together with some unrelated noise There's a little dent in it at time seconds and a little "eye" at time seconds which could correspond to the moments when some Hz noise started and ended and when the filtering that suppresses the ever present steady Hz noise from the grid mains power momentarily changed between overcompensating and undercompensating it and back https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384517/ There are two things going on here The central glitch is somewhere on the border between a rather loud Blip a Koi Fish for the faint "fins" around Hz and Extremely Loud for the more obvious "lighthouse" artefacts around Hz there are much louder examples which share these traits So it's not a clear cut classification Your vote is as good as mine here The surrounding low frequency "wheatgrass" as it has been nicknamed is unrelated a chance near coincidence and is actually caused by scattered light it's hard to recognize here due to the rendering choices very fine time resolution to bring out the central glitch to best effect at the expense of very coarse frequency resolution https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3302220/ These can be classified as Extremely Loud This subject was recorded a couple of seconds before a lockloss tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk on at UTC briefly mentioned in a logbook entry LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep Much of what we see here are data processing artefacts caused by the fact that the data stream abruptly ends just beyond the right edge of the fourth frame The "mast" just inside the right edge is genuine noise though indicating that one of LIGO Livingston's feedback control loops was saturating https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3284783/ Yes this is a fairly typical Power Line glitch as they look like nowadays The extra noise below Hz in these cases is a byproduct "downconversion" as the engineers call it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384528/ Agreed Scattered Light has changed a lot in appearance over the years The large loud multi arch form is no longer happening now the cause for that kind was found in late and fixed in January before the end of O The Field Guide entry links to a relevant article Hanford nowadays has been producing a lot of glitches similar to the present one when rendered with fine frequency resolution and coarse time resolution or looking like "wheatgrass" when rendered with opposite choices or looking "mushy" when rendered in between Scattered Light from Livingston during O has mostly been confined to very low frequencies attracting either Low Frequency Burst or Low Frequency Line classifications sometimes it's been showing up as rows of very thick round arches with little "caps" or "eyebrows" above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384535/ Here's another case where the shape of glitches has changed a whole lot over the years The Gravity Spy Machine Learning calls this a Low Frequency Burst which makes sense insofar as most of the noise is below Hz where it does less harm than at higher frequencies The cause however is Scattered Light What we see are the tops of two arches culminating below Hz at times seconds and seconds with faint hints of additional arches above each between and Hz The left arch is weaker than the central one and its top is lost under background noise leaving only parts of the rising and falling flanks near and seconds How best to classify such subjects is a wide open question at the moment Going by causes we could call them Scattered Light Going by impact on clean observing time it might make more sense to use Low Frequency Burst or Low Frequency Line to distinguish them from Scattered Light glitches that contribute much noise above Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384538/ Yes both came from the same brief "wandering line" episode at Hanford on The feature could be traced over the course of almost minutes This was probably caused by a failure of an air conditioning unit causing the temperature in an electronics room to rise causing a number of smaller fans in the power supply units of the electronics to spin up way beyond their normal rates and one of those fans making noise not only sound but also electromagnetic noise that managed to couple somehow into the ongoing observation See here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3275733?comment for some additional information https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384547/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.
    
GRAVITYBOT RESPONSE:
ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9p4pgaZw4vwZvUa6JQcLMNH5gkvWY', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='### Novel Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2\n\n1. **Sparse Flock** - In Talk Dataset 2, a new glitch class suggested is the "Sparse Flock." This classification describes glitches that appear as a congregation of several blip-like glitches closely resembling a flock but more spaced out. These are characterized by their distribution and density, which are less clustered than traditional flock glitches. The identification of this new class helps in categorizing glitches that previously might have been misclassified or categorized broadly under another type. \n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n\n### Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n\n1. **Misclassification Issues** - In Talk Dataset 2, citizen scientists express concerns over the misclassification of glitches by the machine learning system. For instance, glitches identified as "Scattered Light" are noted to have been frequently mislabeled, prompting discussions about refining the machine learning models to better differentiate between subtypes of scattered light glitches.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3399349/\n\n### Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects\n\n1. **Questions on Classification Accuracy** - Citizen scientists in Talk Dataset 2 are inquiring about the accuracy of the machine learning classifications. They are curious about the criteria and features the algorithm uses to distinguish between similar-looking glitch classes. This reflects a deepening engagement and understanding of the technical framework behind glitch identification.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3399349/\n\n2. **Technical Details of Glitches** - There are questions regarding the specific characteristics that define each glitch class. Participants are trying to understand the nuances that categorize a glitch under classes like "Koi Fish" versus "Anglerfish," which are often visually similar but distinct in their technical attributes.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/\n\n3. **Sensor and Environmental Impacts** - Queries about how environmental factors or sensor alignments impact the frequency and appearance of certain glitches are emerging. This indicates a growing interest in the operational aspects of LIGO and how external conditions influence data quality.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3397461/\n\n### Hypotheses on Glitch Origins\n\n1. **Environmental Influences** - In Talk Dataset 2, there\'s a hypothesis that certain glitches may be influenced by environmental factors such as earthquakes or heavy equipment operations nearby. For instance, discussions about "Richland WA earthquake" and its correlation with observed glitches suggest an analytical approach to connect seismic activities with data anomalies.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396965/\n\n2. **Operational Conditions** - There\'s a hypothesis regarding the influence of operational conditions like "squeezer unlocks" affecting the data.

For instance, differences in glitch occurrences between the Hanford and Livingston sites are questioned, suggesting a localized factor in glitch appearances.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/\n\n2. **Channel Sensitivity and Noise** - Questions emerge about the sensitivity of different data channels to external noise sources and how this sensitivity might lead to the misidentification of glitches. This reflects a nuanced inquiry into the technical setup of LIGO and its susceptibility to external disturbances.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3397747/ \n\nThese points from Talk Dataset 2 highlight an evolution in the community’s engagement, from basic identification to deeper technical inquiries and hypotheses about the underlying causes of glitches.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1721960332, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_7b3074c4b0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=911, prompt_tokens=16740, total_tokens=17651))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

PI and were unable to be damped down by the GRD and we eventually lost lock Parametric Instability modes and are two which should be familiar to the SUS PI guardian so on this occasion it should have commanded good phases only these two modes are known to be prone to ringing up so fast that the available forces in the suspension actuators aren't strong enough to rein them in Unchecked these modes could cause a lockloss within half a minute or less Thus surviving them for several minutes already counts as a success of sorts Apropos of another lockloss on comments on LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep contemplate whether different PI modes were involved on different days But they don't mention the episode The comment trail alludes to an adjustment of the PR mirror suspension on Fri which could have affected the circulating light power in the arms in turn affecting the likelihood of exciting any PIs but this adjustment happened after both the and episodes So we don't have a coherent picture of the whole affair yet The range drop on looks similar to the one on The latter was associated with a rung up PI oscillation near kHz There's no clear statement about whether that was also the case during the former We have a long row of almost glitch subjects during the former we haven't yet seen any glitches that may have happened during the latter and if they produced Gravity Spy subjects then they can't have looked very similar to the present lot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3390873/ Pair of HF bursts or blip variants 93Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3189894/ Tomte blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390971/ Not no glitch ground motion coupling 41Hz Also S99974400 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390980/ Blip ssp varnish run Slightly odd shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390981/ One of these fancy blippish things entering stage right I never can remember what these are but they always remind me of the Marie Celeste at 4s anyway 03Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Flock? snr 01Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391005/ HF burst or high small thin varnish run blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391017/ I have noticed that when I add a subject to a collection and if that subject is already in the collection it is no longer flagged up in red script I deliberately sent a subject several times to one of my collections and it wasn flagged up in red script However when I looked in the collection there were no duplicates Is this something new ?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.
    
GRAVITYBOT RESPONSE:
ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9p4qM3tuikJFIRJuEtQIqias1zCHz', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='1. **New Glitch Classes in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **"Sparse Flock"** is discussed as a potential new glitch class. This classification is proposed to describe a scenario where two near simultaneous blip-like glitches appear, suggesting a group or cluster of glitches that aren\'t dense enough to be considered a typical "Flock." This classification reflects the evolving understanding of how glitches can manifest in less densely packed formations, similar to sparse bird flocks.\n   - **"Fuzzy Range"** is another proposed glitch class mentioned in Talk Dataset 2. It is described as a series of glitches that cause severe drops in sensitivity due to their occupation of middle frequencies, where LIGO sensors are usually most sensitive. The name "Fuzzy Range" was derived from the appearance and effect of these glitches on the data quality, indicating a less defined or "fuzzy" quality in the gravitational wave data.\n   - URLs contributing to the response: [Sparse Flock](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/), [Fuzzy Range](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/)\n\n2. **Concerns with Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a concern that the machine learning model used in the Gravity Spy project is misclassifying certain types of glitches. Specifically, the "Scattered Light" classification is questioned because it seems to encompass multiple distinct types of glitches that should perhaps be classified separately, such as "Cairn" and "60 Hz glitches."\n   - This misclassification underscores a persistence of concerns regarding the adequacy of existing categories to effectively distinguish between subtly different but technically distinct glitch behaviors. This points to a need for model retraining or refinement to improve classification accuracy.\n   - URLs contributing to the response: [Scattered Light Concern](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3399349/)\n\n3. **Emerging Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Questions in Talk Dataset 2 reveal a deeper dive into technical details, such as inquiries about the specific frequencies associated with certain glitches and their potential environmental or instrumental causes. For instance, discussions speculate on whether "Fuzzy Range" episodes might share a common origin with certain environmental influences or instrumental feedback mechanisms.\n   - Another question involves the exact nature and classification criteria for "Sparse Flock" glitches, indicating a desire among citizen scientists to refine their understanding and categorization skills.\n   - These questions reflect a mature engagement with the material, where citizen scientists are not just identifying but are also seeking to understand the deeper mechanics of glitch phenomena.\n   - URLs contributing to the response: [Fuzzy Range Hypothesis](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/), [Sparse Flock Query](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/)\n\n4. **Hypotheses about Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - There are detailed hypotheses regarding the "Fuzzy Range" glitches, suggesting they may be influenced by external environmental factors or internal system dynamics such as feedback loops within the LIGO detectors. The hypothesis posits that similar causes might be influencing glitch occurrences at different LIGO sites, indicating a possible systemic issue.\n   - Analytical motivations for these hypotheses include the observation of simultaneous occurrences of similar glitches across sites, temporal correlations with environmental events, and an understanding of the sensitive nature of LIGO\'s detection capabilities.\n   - URLs contributing to the response: [Fuzzy Range Hypothesis](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/)\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are emerging questions about whether glitches like the "Fuzzy Range" are specific to particular sensors or if they manifest across multiple channels. Discussions revolve around the need to compare data from different sensors to ascertain if these glitches are isolated or widespread, suggesting a more complex interaction within the detector system.\n   - These inquiries demonstrate an advanced level of technical engagement and an understanding that resolving such questions might lead to better glitch mitigation strategies or adjustments in sensor calibration.\n   - URL contributing to the response: [Sensor-Specific Inquiry](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/)', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1721960374, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_7b3074c4b0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=945, prompt_tokens=16740, total_tokens=17685))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Which one? Are we seeing a side effect of SUS PI periodically commanding new phase correction values to the fast phase locked loop that applies sine wave forces in the tens of kHz to the test mass quadrants to counteract the oscillation? If so it doesn't seem to have been very successful maybe the rung up mode wasn't the one that SUS PI thought it had to contend with A different mode resonating at a slightly different frequency might have resulted in a long row of less than helpful phase adjustments The logbook provides a little more context but raises yet more questions The Data Quality Shift summary LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep for the week around July tantalizingly notes > There is a glitch cluster just before H lost lock due to environmental factors on Thursday and Friday Okay the glitch cluster on Thursday is precisely what we're dealing with here What about Friday 05?

PI and were unable to be damped down by the GRD and we eventually lost lock Parametric Instability modes and are two which should be familiar to the SUS PI guardian so on this occasion it should have commanded good phases only these two modes are known to be prone to ringing up so fast that the available forces in the suspension actuators aren't strong enough to rein them in Unchecked these modes could cause a lockloss within half a minute or less Thus surviving them for several minutes already counts as a success of sorts Apropos of another lockloss on comments on LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep contemplate whether different PI modes were involved on different days But they don't mention the episode The comment trail alludes to an adjustment of the PR mirror suspension on Fri which could have affected the circulating light power in the arms in turn affecting the likelihood of exciting any PIs but this adjustment happened after both the and episodes So we don't have a coherent picture of the whole affair yet The range drop on looks similar to the one on The latter was associated with a rung up PI oscillation near kHz There's no clear statement about whether that was also the case during the former We have a long row of almost glitch subjects during the former we haven't yet seen any glitches that may have happened during the latter and if they produced Gravity Spy subjects then they can't have looked very similar to the present lot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3390873/ Pair of HF bursts or blip variants 93Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3189894/ Tomte blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390971/ Not no glitch ground motion coupling 41Hz Also S99974400 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390980/ Blip ssp varnish run Slightly odd shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390981/ One of these fancy blippish things entering stage right I never can remember what these are but they always remind me of the Marie Celeste at 4s anyway 03Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Flock? snr 01Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391005/ HF burst or high small thin varnish run blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391017/ I have noticed that when I add a subject to a collection and if that subject is already in the collection it is no longer flagged up in red script I deliberately sent a subject several times to one of my collections and it wasn flagged up in red script However when I looked in the collection there were no duplicates Is this something new ?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9p50KQ4HANSojRDoI2loqikiP5Keg', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='1. **New Glitch Classes in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Sparse Flock:** This is one of the proposed new glitch classes mentioned in Talk Dataset 2. It is described as a phenomenon involving a blend of two near-simultaneous blip-like glitches, suggesting a gathering (or flock) of at least four glitches, not counting fainter occurrences. The term \'sparse\' indicates that these glitches are not as densely packed as might be seen in other \'flock\' categorizations, allowing for a more scattered appearance.\n   - URLs contributing to this response:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - Concerns in Talk Dataset 2 touch upon the misclassification by the machine learning models used in the Gravity Spy project. For instance, there are comments on the \'Scattered Light\' class being too broad, encompassing glitches that should be segmented into more precise categories such as \'Traditional scattered light\', \'Cairn\', and \'Hz glitches\'. This indicates an ongoing issue with the generalization in machine learning classifications not adequately capturing the nuanced differences observed by the citizen scientists.\n   - URLs contributing to this response:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3399349/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a noticeable curiosity about the relationship between environmental factors and glitch occurrences. Questions are raised about whether conditions like the "Hz monster" or "big ugly" at different sites such as Livingston are related or if they have different origins. These inquiries reflect a deeper dive into understanding site-specific environmental interactions with sensor data.\n   - Another thread of inquiry involves the technical aspect of how specific sensor adjustments or anomalies, like the squeezer unlocks, might correlate with observed glitches. These questions indicate a growing sophistication in the citizen scientists\' approach to linking operational aspects of LIGO to data anomalies.\n   - URLs contributing to this response:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162/\n\n4. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - A hypothesis mentioned involves the \'Hz monster\' and its potential linkage to a specific environmental or operational condition at the Livingston site. The hypothesis suggests that this recurring glitch could be a result of particular environmental influences or a malfunction in an operational subsystem like the squeezer. The analytical motivation stems from observing consistent patterns associated with these glitches during specific operational conditions or environmental setups.\n   - URLs contributing to this response:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162/\n\n5. **Questions Relating to Specific Sensors or Channels in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are discussions concerning the sensitivity of specific LIGO sensors to environmental disturbances, leading to queries about whether these sensors are overly sensitive or if the glitches are indicative of a need for recalibration or adjustment. These thoughts are motivated by the observation of glitches like the \'Hz monster\', which seem to recur under specific conditions, hinting at possible sensor-specific sensitivities or anomalies.\n   - URLs contributing to this response:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1721960992, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_eb105741d7', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=828, prompt_tokens=16740, total_tokens=17568))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Which one? Are we seeing a side effect of SUS PI periodically commanding new phase correction values to the fast phase locked loop that applies sine wave forces in the tens of kHz to the test mass quadrants to counteract the oscillation? If so it doesn't seem to have been very successful maybe the rung up mode wasn't the one that SUS PI thought it had to contend with A different mode resonating at a slightly different frequency might have resulted in a long row of less than helpful phase adjustments The logbook provides a little more context but raises yet more questions The Data Quality Shift summary LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep for the week around July tantalizingly notes > There is a glitch cluster just before H lost lock due to environmental factors on Thursday and Friday Okay the glitch cluster on Thursday is precisely what we're dealing with here What about Friday 05?

PI and were unable to be damped down by the GRD and we eventually lost lock Parametric Instability modes and are two which should be familiar to the SUS PI guardian so on this occasion it should have commanded good phases only these two modes are known to be prone to ringing up so fast that the available forces in the suspension actuators aren't strong enough to rein them in Unchecked these modes could cause a lockloss within half a minute or less Thus surviving them for several minutes already counts as a success of sorts Apropos of another lockloss on comments on LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep contemplate whether different PI modes were involved on different days But they don't mention the episode The comment trail alludes to an adjustment of the PR mirror suspension on Fri which could have affected the circulating light power in the arms in turn affecting the likelihood of exciting any PIs but this adjustment happened after both the and episodes So we don't have a coherent picture of the whole affair yet The range drop on looks similar to the one on The latter was associated with a rung up PI oscillation near kHz There's no clear statement about whether that was also the case during the former We have a long row of almost glitch subjects during the former we haven't yet seen any glitches that may have happened during the latter and if they produced Gravity Spy subjects then they can't have looked very similar to the present lot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3390873/ Pair of HF bursts or blip variants 93Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3189894/ Tomte blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390971/ Not no glitch ground motion coupling 41Hz Also S99974400 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390980/ Blip ssp varnish run Slightly odd shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390981/ One of these fancy blippish things entering stage right I never can remember what these are but they always remind me of the Marie Celeste at 4s anyway 03Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Flock? snr 01Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391005/ HF burst or high small thin varnish run blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391017/ I have noticed that when I add a subject to a collection and if that subject is already in the collection it is no longer flagged up in red script I deliberately sent a subject several times to one of my collections and it wasn flagged up in red script However when I looked in the collection there were no duplicates Is this something new ?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

These glitches are not loud individually but occupy the middle frequencies where LIGO is most sensitive. They were first observed in late November and April at Hanford and have similar occurrences at Livingston, indicating a possibly common underlying cause across sites. Specifically, they are mentioned in relation to severe drops in sensitivity and are linked with subjects from both Hanford and Livingston.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146\n\n2. **Concerns with Existing Glitch Classes**:\n   - **Scattered Light Misclassifications:** In Talk Dataset 2, there is significant mention of the machine learning model\'s failure to accurately classify different types of scattered light glitches. Although these glitches have been recognized before, Citizen scientists and researchers identify a need for better differentiation among traditional scattered light, Cairn glitches, and 50 Hz glitches. It is evident that the model currently groups diverse glitch phenomena under a broad category, which could hinder precise analysis.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3399349 \n\n3. **Emerging Questions on Classifications and Technical Aspects**:\n   - **Reevaluation of "Fuzzy Range" Phenomenon:** Participants inquire about the nature of "fuzzy range" episodes, questioning whether similar mechanisms might be at play in both Hanford and Livingston setups. This shows a deeper dive into understanding whether shared environmental factors or instrument characteristics are influencing these observations.\n   - **Inquiries about Machine Learning Classifications:** There is a growing need for updating machine learning classifiers as new glitch types are identified. Questions about integrating new data for model training signify an active engagement in enhancing detection algorithms.\n   - **Subdivision of Scattered Light Class:** Questions arise about the appropriate categorization of glitches within the scattered light classification, indicating a push towards more granular understanding and categorization in machine learning models.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3399349 \n\n4. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins**:\n   - **Environmental Influences on "Fuzzy Range" Glitches:** There are specific hypotheses that these glitches may be influenced by common environmental conditions at both Hanford and Livingston or by shared instrumental characteristics. This hypothesis arises from the observation that similar glitch patterns appear concurrently at different sites.\n   - **Relation of Glitches to External Environmental Factors:** Some glitches are speculated to be caused by external factors like earthquakes or heavy machinery, as indicated by the timing of glitches and external events like earthquakes reported near LIGO sites.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Questions and Thoughts in Talk Dataset 2**:\n   - **Inquiries about Specific Sensors\' Roles:** There are discussions about whether particular sensors or subsystems, like the squeezer subsystem, might be contributing to observed glitches, especially in the context of "fuzzy range" episodes. This reflects a nuanced approach to identifying potential sources of anomalies within the complex LIGO sensor arrays.\n   - **Questions on Channel-Specific Noise Contributions:** Discussions also extend to whether specific channels or frequency bands are more susceptible to certain types of noise or glitches, indicating a targeted approach to diagnose and mitigate these issues.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1721961111, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_7b3074c4b0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=846, prompt_tokens=16740, total_tokens=17586))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Which one? Are we seeing a side effect of SUS PI periodically commanding new phase correction values to the fast phase locked loop that applies sine wave forces in the tens of kHz to the test mass quadrants to counteract the oscillation? If so it doesn't seem to have been very successful maybe the rung up mode wasn't the one that SUS PI thought it had to contend with A different mode resonating at a slightly different frequency might have resulted in a long row of less than helpful phase adjustments The logbook provides a little more context but raises yet more questions The Data Quality Shift summary LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep for the week around July tantalizingly notes > There is a glitch cluster just before H lost lock due to environmental factors on Thursday and Friday Okay the glitch cluster on Thursday is precisely what we're dealing with here What about Friday 05?

PI and were unable to be damped down by the GRD and we eventually lost lock Parametric Instability modes and are two which should be familiar to the SUS PI guardian so on this occasion it should have commanded good phases only these two modes are known to be prone to ringing up so fast that the available forces in the suspension actuators aren't strong enough to rein them in Unchecked these modes could cause a lockloss within half a minute or less Thus surviving them for several minutes already counts as a success of sorts Apropos of another lockloss on comments on LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep contemplate whether different PI modes were involved on different days But they don't mention the episode The comment trail alludes to an adjustment of the PR mirror suspension on Fri which could have affected the circulating light power in the arms in turn affecting the likelihood of exciting any PIs but this adjustment happened after both the and episodes So we don't have a coherent picture of the whole affair yet The range drop on looks similar to the one on The latter was associated with a rung up PI oscillation near kHz There's no clear statement about whether that was also the case during the former We have a long row of almost glitch subjects during the former we haven't yet seen any glitches that may have happened during the latter and if they produced Gravity Spy subjects then they can't have looked very similar to the present lot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3390873/ Pair of HF bursts or blip variants 93Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3189894/ Tomte blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390971/ Not no glitch ground motion coupling 41Hz Also S99974400 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390980/ Blip ssp varnish run Slightly odd shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390981/ One of these fancy blippish things entering stage right I never can remember what these are but they always remind me of the Marie Celeste at 4s anyway 03Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Flock? snr 01Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391005/ HF burst or high small thin varnish run blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391017/ I have noticed that when I add a subject to a collection and if that subject is already in the collection it is no longer flagged up in red script I deliberately sent a subject several times to one of my collections and it wasn flagged up in red script However when I looked in the collection there were no duplicates Is this something new ?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

These are characterized by their occurrence during specific times and involve a series of glitches affecting the middle frequencies, thereby causing significant sensitivity drops in the detectors. This glitch class is possibly linked to environmental factors or operational conditions at the LIGO observatories.\n   - **"Sparse Flock"**: Another proposed class is the "sparse flock," described as a collection of simultaneous blip-like glitches that resemble a flock, but are fewer in number, hence termed "sparse." This class emerges from observing patterns where glitches are not alone but are not abundant enough to form a typical flock. \n   - **URLs contributing to the response**: \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a noted concern regarding the "Scattered Light" glitch class. Participants discuss how this class might be overly broad, encompassing at least three different types of glitches that the machine learning model is failing to distinguish—traditional scattered light, cairn glitches, and 60 Hz glitches. This indicates a need for refined classification to improve model accuracy and glitch understanding.\n   - **URLs contributing to the response**: \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3399349/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science:**\n   - Participants in Talk Dataset 2 raise technical queries about the relationship between specific glitches and environmental influences, questioning whether operational conditions like "fuzzy range" episodes correlate with external vibrations or other environmental factors.\n   - There is curiosity about how certain glitches such as the "sparse flock" might affect the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors, indicating a deeper dive into understanding the impact of these glitches on scientific observations.\n   - The discussions also involve inquiries about the potential need for new hardware or software adjustments at the observatories to better manage or mitigate the effects of identified glitch classes. \n   - **URLs contributing to the response**: \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, hypotheses about the origins of the "fuzzy range" glitches suggest they may be related to specific operational or environmental conditions, such as heavy machinery operating nearby or changes in the ambient environment affecting the detectors.\n   - There is a hypothesis that the "sparse flock" glitch class could be caused by intermittent electronic or mechanical disturbances that are not constant enough to form regular patterns, suggesting sporadic issues in the detector\'s environment or systems.\n   - **URLs contributing to the response**: \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n\n5. **Connections Between Glitches, Sensors, and Channels:**\n   - Talk Dataset 2 discusses concerns about whether specific glitches are linked to particular sensors or parts of the LIGO detectors, with a focus on understanding if certain sensors are more susceptible to types of glitches like "fuzzy range" or "sparse flock."\n   - This includes questions about whether the configuration or location of sensors might influence the frequency or type of glitches observed, indicating a search for patterns that could inform better sensor placements or protective measures.\n   - **URLs contributing to the response**: \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722034408, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_7b3074c4b0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=895, prompt_tokens=16740, total_tokens=17635))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Short description Loud short duration glitches below Hz sometimes alone mostly in regular rows spaced seconds or multiples thereof apart Characteristics All nearly currently known examples come from a single episode at Hanford on during an unattended night shift between about UTC and a probably unrelated lockloss at UTC The underlying cadence appears to persist throughout most of this interval although it may be punctuated by fainter glitchlets or by gaps omitting one or a few time slots as in the first two type specimens I am tempted to argue that we're dealing with a single composite glitch that lasted half an hour Each individual baby Koi is a very close overlapping double with the two constituents separated by less than milliseconds Reported peak frequencies range from to less than Hz SNRs from to more than durations from less than seconds to about seconds sometimes Omicron triggered on a single "doubleclick" sometimes it treated a long run of consecutive baby Koi as a single event Almost all have attracted renderings at Q A few at Q exist g the fifth co type specimen above Hash tags a Collections NB the metadata links do not work at present pending a DYCWMI tool bugfix but will work once the tool has been fixed no training set yet creating one would mostly amount to arranging subjects in chronological order and then avoiding large overlaps between consecutive subjects at same Q Bulk collections growing Baby Koi Fish glitch tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections hikari gaby baby koi fish glitch link to its metadata tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu collection info collection info ?username hikari gaby collection display name baby koi fish glitch by Hikari Gaby H O4b doubleclick baby Koi tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h b doubleclick baby koi link to its metadata tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu collection info collection info ?username zngabitant collection display name h b doubleclick baby koi by ZngabitanT Collaborators hColleen Hikari Gaby Hyena Pak Dinowrawr mitchnanny Remarks Whereas the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search easily groups these subjects together as a fairly homogeneous population the Gravity Spy Machine Learning hasn't been able to place them mis labeling many as Helix some as Paired Doves or Light Modulation and only a minority as Koi Fish or Extremely Loud Having looked at a number of O subjects where I can also extract ASD spectra from the published raw strain data I would guess from their appearance that the baby Koi have fairly steep spectra around This July episode coincides with a marked sensitivity BNS range drop as seen on the Summary Page tab https gwosc org detector status day !

Which one? Are we seeing a side effect of SUS PI periodically commanding new phase correction values to the fast phase locked loop that applies sine wave forces in the tens of kHz to the test mass quadrants to counteract the oscillation? If so it doesn't seem to have been very successful maybe the rung up mode wasn't the one that SUS PI thought it had to contend with A different mode resonating at a slightly different frequency might have resulted in a long row of less than helpful phase adjustments The logbook provides a little more context but raises yet more questions The Data Quality Shift summary LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep for the week around July tantalizingly notes > There is a glitch cluster just before H lost lock due to environmental factors on Thursday and Friday Okay the glitch cluster on Thursday is precisely what we're dealing with here What about Friday 05?

PI and were unable to be damped down by the GRD and we eventually lost lock Parametric Instability modes and are two which should be familiar to the SUS PI guardian so on this occasion it should have commanded good phases only these two modes are known to be prone to ringing up so fast that the available forces in the suspension actuators aren't strong enough to rein them in Unchecked these modes could cause a lockloss within half a minute or less Thus surviving them for several minutes already counts as a success of sorts Apropos of another lockloss on comments on LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep contemplate whether different PI modes were involved on different days But they don't mention the episode The comment trail alludes to an adjustment of the PR mirror suspension on Fri which could have affected the circulating light power in the arms in turn affecting the likelihood of exciting any PIs but this adjustment happened after both the and episodes So we don't have a coherent picture of the whole affair yet The range drop on looks similar to the one on The latter was associated with a rung up PI oscillation near kHz There's no clear statement about whether that was also the case during the former We have a long row of almost glitch subjects during the former we haven't yet seen any glitches that may have happened during the latter and if they produced Gravity Spy subjects then they can't have looked very similar to the present lot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3390873/ Pair of HF bursts or blip variants 93Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3189894/ Tomte blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390971/ Not no glitch ground motion coupling 41Hz Also S99974400 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390980/ Blip ssp varnish run Slightly odd shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390981/ One of these fancy blippish things entering stage right I never can remember what these are but they always remind me of the Marie Celeste at 4s anyway 03Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Flock? snr 01Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391005/ HF burst or high small thin varnish run blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391017/ I have noticed that when I add a subject to a collection and if that subject is already in the collection it is no longer flagged up in red script I deliberately sent a subject several times to one of my collections and it wasn flagged up in red script However when I looked in the collection there were no duplicates Is this something new ?

They are part of the Koi Fish glitch They are artefacts of the data processing arising when a loud short duration glitch with much of its noise near Hz interacts with the filtering that removes the ever present Hz noise from the electricity mains supplies Similarly the "lighthouse" effects arise in other subjects when a short duration glitch has enough noise near Hz where the fundamental violin modes ever present to some extent are filtered out Very loud glitches can acquire such artefacts at a number of other frequencies and will then turn into "anglerfish" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/ Thank you ZngabitanT https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/ Blip at with a tomte at which probably has its own object Also diffraction grating https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396657/ Doesn't look like the typical scattered light even with the quiet band between 20Hz The three loud glitches above that band and below 32Hz remind me of a streamlined fish and the single glitch below that band looks like a flattened 'c' https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396667/ non symmetry koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396682/ maybe 64Hz fuzzy range loud case https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396767/ Atypical koi fish tail off center at also diffraction grating above about 32Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396891/ 128Hz ripple with 'rain' above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396893/ Another Not No Glitch 41Hz Ground motion coupling Also S S S on 2024 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396948/ Fuzzy? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396951/ Richland WA earthquake Nessie 86Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396965/ Not no glitch Ground motion coupling from 41Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396974/ 52Hz ADF transient https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396979/ https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep around UTC summertime at Hanford sorry can remember what this is called Lockloss no obvious cause https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396994/ Scattered light low scattering? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396999/ Whoops At Livingston this had already started on Tuesday around UTC subjects from that day are only now emerging from my cascaded similarity searches in part because only now the search has become deep enough to reach the louder examples which had at first eluded us The tell tale range dip in the gwistat tab https online ligo org plot !

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The "Sparse Flock" is described as involving a central glitch with a notch suggesting a blend of two simultaneous blip-like glitches, implying a group of glitches with fainter surrounding disturbances. The "Fuzzy Range" glitches seem to be correlated with specific range drops and operational issues, appearing similar across different observations and possibly related to specific environmental or operational conditions. \n   - URLs contributing to these descriptions: [Sparse Flock](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146), [Fuzzy Range](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396198).\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Dataset 2, there are expressed concerns about the "Scattered Light" glitch class. Citizen scientists highlight that this class is overly broad and might be encompassing multiple distinct types of glitches. Specifically, they differentiate between "Traditional scattered light glitches," "Cairn glitches," and "Hz glitches," suggesting a need to refine and possibly subdivide this classification for more accurate categorization in machine learning models.\n   - URLs contributing to these concerns: [Scattered Light Concern](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349).\n\n3. **Emerging Questions in Glitch Classifications and Sensory Technology:**\n   - In Dataset 2, there is a notable curiosity about the influence of specific environmental conditions, like weather ("fuzzy range") and seismic activities, on the sensors and the resultant data. Questions arise about how these conditions might systematically affect the frequency and characteristics of observed glitches, urging a deeper examination of environmental shielding or compensation techniques.\n   - Another technological curiosity emerging in Dataset 2 is about how machine learning models could be enhanced to distinguish between similarly appearing glitch categories, such as those ambiguously grouped under "Scattered Light."\n   - URLs contributing to these discussions: [Environmental Questions](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162), [Machine Learning Model Enhancement](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349).\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Dataset 2:**\n   - The "Fuzzy Range" episodes are hypothesized to be related to specific tuning issues in the interferometer\'s squeezer subsystem, potentially affecting the mirror FC at the far end of the filter cavity, influencing phase noise at multiples of a 62Hz fundamental. This hypothesis shows a direct attempt to link observed data anomalies with specific mechanical or operational aspects of the LIGO apparatus.\n   - URLs contributing to this hypothesis: [Fuzzy Range Hypothesis](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162).\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Questions in Dataset 2:**\n   - In Dataset 2, discussions emerge about possible sensor-specific issues, particularly questioning the influence of the squeezer subsystem on observed glitches. There are inquiries into whether the subsystem malfunctions are just victims of a common environmental influence or if they themselves are inducing anomalies detectable in the gravitational wave data. This suggests a growing awareness and concern among citizen scientists about how different components of the sensor apparatus might contribute distinctly to data quality.\n   - URLs contributing to this discussion: [Sensor Specific Concerns](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162).', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722308365, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_0993c4a4c0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=795, prompt_tokens=19593, total_tokens=20388))

    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow? I'll be travelling tomorrow and may not be able to follow up further before Friday https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Well spotted! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3398448/ Yes well noted The Livingston engineers are still hunting for the cause They haven't yet used the word "fuzzy" to describe this phenomenon instead calling it " Hz monster" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep or "Big ugly" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ I hope big ugly isn the sensitive type! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ Surely not given what it's been doing to LLO's sensitivity curve !

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

It is noted for its connection with specific large-scale environmental or operational scenarios that result in distinctive and recurrent signal patterns. The citizen scientists discuss the potential origins related to operational settings or environmental factors affecting the sensors. \n   - **Sparse Flock**: This class is suggested due to the distinct pattern of glitches resembling a flock, but with fewer members and more dispersed occurrences. It emphasizes the nuanced differences in glitch patterns that could indicate different underlying causes or sensor responses.\n   (URLs influencing response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/l-b-fuzzy-range-episode-16ff)\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - Concerns are raised about the **Scattered Light** classification, as it seems to be a catch-all category that might be oversimplifying the distinctions between different types of glitches. The discussion suggests that there are at least three sub-classes within what is currently classified as Scattered Light, indicating a need for refinement in classification to enhance the accuracy of glitch identification.\n   - The classification of **Koi Fish** glitches also faces scrutiny for potentially including different types of glitches under one banner, which might obscure the specific characteristics and origins of each type.\n   (URLs influencing response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/)\n\n3. **Emerging Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Questions arise about the specific frequencies and durations that define the newly observed glitch classes, such as the Sparse Flock and Fuzzy Range Episode. This reflects a deeper engagement with the technical aspects of glitch analysis and classification.\n   - There are inquiries about how external factors like weather or operational changes at the LIGO sites might be influencing the occurrence and characteristics of specific glitches, indicating a growing interest in the environmental and operational contexts of gravitational wave detection.\n   - Discussions also explore the potential for machine learning improvements, with suggestions for retraining models to better distinguish between subtly different glitch classes. This indicates a proactive approach to refining detection and classification techniques based on citizen science observations.\n   (URLs influencing response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/)\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - There are specific hypotheses about the origins of the Fuzzy Range Episode glitches, suggesting they may be related to operational issues such as squeezer subsystem malfunctions or environmental factors impacting sensor behavior.\n   - The Sparse Flock glitches are hypothesized to be caused by environmental disturbances that are less intense or less frequent, leading to the sparser and more dispersed appearance of these glitches in spectrograms.\n   - The hypothesis that certain glitches, especially those classified under Scattered Light, might be due to specific operational settings or maintenance activities at the LIGO sites, suggests a direct link between human-induced activities and glitch occurrences.\n   (URLs influencing response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3397455/)\n\n5. **Sensor or Channel-Specific Issues in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - There are discussions regarding whether specific sensors or channels at the LIGO facilities might be more susceptible to certain types of glitches, such as those observed in the Fuzzy Range Episode. This indicates a nuanced understanding of how different parts of the experimental setup might differently impact data quality.\n   - Questions are raised about the potential for certain sensors to exhibit unique responses to environmental conditions, leading to the suggestion that some sensors might need recalibration or targeted monitoring to reduce the incidence of specific glitch types.\n   (URLs influencing response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3397461/)', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722315929, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_0993c4a4c0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=948, prompt_tokens=19593, total_tokens=20541))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow? I'll be travelling tomorrow and may not be able to follow up further before Friday https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Well spotted! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3398448/ Yes well noted The Livingston engineers are still hunting for the cause They haven't yet used the word "fuzzy" to describe this phenomenon instead calling it " Hz monster" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep or "Big ugly" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ I hope big ugly isn the sensitive type! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ Surely not given what it's been doing to LLO's sensitivity curve !

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The term "sparse flock" emphasizes the dispersed arrangement of these glitches, hinting at their simultaneous occurrence but scattered distribution. \n   - **Fuzzy Range**: The classification "fuzzy range" is introduced to describe glitches that exhibit a fuzzy appearance in the data, potentially linked to medium frequency noise disturbances. This category reflects the citizen scientists\' observation of noise that does not fit into the clean patterns of known glitch types and is characterized by its "fuzzy" spectral appearance.\n   URLs contributing to the responses: \n   - Sparse Flock: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n   - Fuzzy Range: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396198/\n\n2. **Concerns About Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - **Scattered Light Classification Concerns**: In Talk Dataset 2, citizen scientists express concerns about the misclassification of scattered light glitches by the machine learning model. They point out that the model often conflates distinct types of scattered light glitches, leading to incorrect categorization, which affects the training and accuracy of the model.\n   URL contributing to the response:\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions on Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - Citizen scientists in Talk Dataset 2 question the specific characteristics that define certain glitch classes like "Cairn" and "Hz glitches," reflecting their desire to refine classification criteria. This curiosity helps improve machine learning models by providing clearer distinctions between similar-looking but different-origin glitches.\n   - Questions about the technical setup and response of sensors to environmental factors suggest an inclination towards understanding the deeper mechanics of LIGO operations. For instance, discussions about how specific sensors react to environmental noises or perturbations show a nuanced approach to analyzing data quality.\n   URL contributing to the responses:\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n\n4. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Environmental Influence on \'Fuzzy Range\' Glitches**: Citizen scientists hypothesize that "fuzzy range" glitches could be influenced by environmental factors affecting the sensors, possibly medium-frequency noise or operational disturbances in the interferometer setup. They suggest that external conditions like seismic activity or operational anomalies in nearby equipment could correlate with the occurrences of these glitches.\n   - **Squeezer Subsystem Influence**: Another hypothesis involves the squeezer subsystem of LIGO potentially coupling noise into the interferometer, indicated by the recurring "fuzzy range" episodes corresponding with squeezer unlocks or disturbances.\n   URLs contributing to the responses:\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396198/\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162/\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Issues and Thoughts in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Citizen scientists raise questions about whether certain glitches are specifically associated with either the Hanford or Livingston LIGO sites. For instance, they discuss the "fuzzy range" episodes possibly being linked to the operational states or specific environmental conditions at these sites, reflecting a deeper inquiry into site-specific data behavior and sensor responses.\n   URL contributing to the response:\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396198/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722316198, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_0993c4a4c0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=789, prompt_tokens=19593, total_tokens=20382))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

LVK sensitivity curves https gwosc org summary pages detector status cache day G1H1L1V OBSERVING HOFT SPECTRUM png tab https gwosc org detector status day And at the frequencies corresponding to the "yardarms" there'll be vertical spikes sticking out These are what the engineers mean when they talk about spectral lines in the measured gravitational strain data stream Normally they're filtered out completely before our subject images are produced So we don't get to see them in our subjects unless there's either a loud glitch upsetting the filtering or unless something has made them fluctuate in intensity on a timescale shorter than about seconds https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Thank you Is there any particular classification other than extremely loud?

Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

This description highlights an ongoing exploration of glitch patterns that exhibit simultaneous or closely spaced occurrences, potentially indicating a new subcategory of flock-like glitches. \n   - **"Fuzzy Range"** is another term that arises, characterized by glitches that visually appear as fuzzy or blurry in the spectrogram. This name reflects their unclear and diffuse appearance, possibly pointing to a unique underlying mechanism different from sharper, more defined glitches.\n   - URLs contributing to this analysis include:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396198/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is an expressed need for refining the machine learning model because certain glitches like **"Scattered Light"** are incorrectly classified. This indicates ongoing challenges in accurately categorizing glitches, with the machine learning model sometimes conflating different glitch classes that share superficial similarities.\n   - URLs contributing to this analysis include:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Science:**\n   - Users in Talk Dataset 2 are inquisitive about the specific characteristics that define the newly proposed glitch classes like "Sparse Flock" and "Fuzzy Range." They are keen on understanding how these new classes differ significantly in their spectral features from already known classes.\n   - There are questions about the effectiveness of current classification tools and methodologies, indicating a desire to enhance the accuracy of glitch identification.\n   - The discussion extends to the technical aspects of gravitational wave science, where users are curious about the physical implications of misclassified glitches on the overall data integrity and gravitational wave detection.\n   - URLs contributing to this analysis include:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/\n\n4. **Hypotheses about Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - There are hypotheses that some glitches, particularly the "Fuzzy Range" episodes, might be related to squeezer subsystem malfunctions, suggesting a technical origin within the LIGO\'s instrumental setup.\n   - Another hypothesis proposes that environmental factors like seismic activities could be stimulating certain glitches, noted from the correlation with recorded seismic events and glitch occurrences.\n   - URLs contributing to this analysis include:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3398445/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are discussions about whether the observed new glitch classes like "Sparse Flock" and "Fuzzy Range" are prevalent in one LIGO detector more than the other (Hanford vs. Livingston). This suggests an interest in understanding if certain sensors or channels are more susceptible to specific types of glitches.\n   - URLs contributing to this analysis include:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722316605, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_0993c4a4c0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=786, prompt_tokens=19593, total_tokens=20379))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

I realise I haven been doing as much GS lately so am not completely up to date Thank you https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3391042/ Flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391046/ It still works as before for me when I do it from the subject's Talk page Do you see the changed behaviour when you're adding a subject while you're still in the Classifier before clicking on "Done" or "Done Talk"? Things could conceivable work differently there e in the new Zooniverse user interface frontend while Talk pages still use the old frontend but this is something I wouldn't notice myself because I practically never collect a subject before hitting "Done Talk" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3391042/ I will try that I save before clicking Done and Talk in case it disappears sometimes happens with me usually my fault Thank you https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3391042/ Well spotted! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390980/ These extremely loud glitches usually get rendered at Q when they appear central stage but often like here attract higher Q renderings when there's an extraneous offset trigger And then all these "yardarms" will show up Each correspends to a frequency where there's a lot of background noise all the time because such loud glitches momentarily mess up the filtering that normally suppresses such stationary noise Among others we can make out Hz electricity mains and its third harmonic the thin one at Hz halfway on the logarithmic scale between and the fifth harmonic at Hz is blended with other stuff nearby resulting in a rather thick "yardarm" there we also see the fundamental violin modes near Hz and their second harmonics near Hz and there are a few others that I can't explain offhand Now if we were to plot noise levels versus frequency with the logarithmic frequency axis horizontal instead of vertical and logarithmic noise intensity on the vertical axis we'd get averaged over the same day from which this subject came something like the red curve below ! LVK sensitivity curves https gwosc org summary pages detector status cache day G1H1L1V OBSERVING HOFT SPECTRUM png tab https gwosc org detector status day And at the frequencies corresponding to the "yardarms" there'll be vertical spikes sticking out These are what the engineers mean when they talk about spectral lines in the measured gravitational strain data stream Normally they're filtered out completely before our subject images are produced So we don't get to see them in our subjects unless there's either a loud glitch upsetting the filtering or unless something has made them fluctuate in intensity on a timescale shorter than about seconds https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Thank you Is there any particular classification other than extremely loud?

Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread!

The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

This classification is suggested due to the observation of glitches that appear to be blends of two near-simultaneous blip-like glitches, which they describe as having a central feature with a notable notch, suggesting a composite rather than a singular event. This classification aims to address configurations that don\'t strictly fit into the existing "Flock" category due to their sparser occurrence and distinct features.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes**\n   - Concerns are raised about the "Scattered Light" classification, where it\'s noted that this class might be too broad, encompassing multiple distinct types of glitches. Citizen scientists and researchers are observing that traditional scattered light glitches, cairn glitches, and 60 Hz glitches are often lumped together, which could confuse the machine learning model used for automated classification. They suggest refining and retraining the model to better differentiate these subclasses.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, questions emerge about the specific attributes of glitches, such as their frequency ranges and durations, particularly concerning the newly observed classes like "Cairn" glitches. Citizen scientists are interested in defining the typical frequency and duration that characterize these glitches to aid in more accurate classification and understanding.\n   - There is curiosity about whether environmental factors or intrinsic sensor issues cause specific glitch patterns, leading to discussions on how to distinguish these origins effectively.\n   - Questions are also raised about the interaction between glitches and gravitational wave detection equipment, particularly how certain glitches might affect the sensitivity of LIGO detectors and what that implies for data integrity and gravitational wave observations.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2**\n   - A specific hypothesis discussed concerns the "Fuzzy Range" episodes, where it\'s suggested that these might be linked to the squeezer subsystem of the LIGO detectors. The hypothesis posits that this subsystem could be coupling medium frequency noise into the interferometer, affecting the detector\'s sensitivity. This is analytically motivated by observed correlations between squeezer operation times and occurrences of fuzzy range glitches.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162/\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Connections to Specific Sensors or Channels**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a specific discussion about whether the observed "fuzzy range" glitches at the Livingston LIGO site might be linked to specific parts of the detector setup, such as the squeezer subsystem or the FC mirror suspension movements. These questions are driven by observations of correlations between specific component behaviors and glitch occurrences, suggesting a deeper investigation into how different detector components might influence data quality.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722317154, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_0993c4a4c0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=722, prompt_tokens=19593, total_tokens=20315))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

If so it doesn't seem to have been very successful maybe the rung up mode wasn't the one that SUS PI thought it had to contend with A different mode resonating at a slightly different frequency might have resulted in a long row of less than helpful phase adjustments The logbook provides a little more context but raises yet more questions The Data Quality Shift summary LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep for the week around July tantalizingly notes > There is a glitch cluster just before H lost lock due to environmental factors on Thursday and Friday Okay the glitch cluster on Thursday is precisely what we're dealing with here What about Friday 05?

PI and were unable to be damped down by the GRD and we eventually lost lock Parametric Instability modes and are two which should be familiar to the SUS PI guardian so on this occasion it should have commanded good phases only these two modes are known to be prone to ringing up so fast that the available forces in the suspension actuators aren't strong enough to rein them in Unchecked these modes could cause a lockloss within half a minute or less Thus surviving them for several minutes already counts as a success of sorts Apropos of another lockloss on comments on LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep contemplate whether different PI modes were involved on different days But they don't mention the episode The comment trail alludes to an adjustment of the PR mirror suspension on Fri which could have affected the circulating light power in the arms in turn affecting the likelihood of exciting any PIs but this adjustment happened after both the and episodes So we don't have a coherent picture of the whole affair yet The range drop on looks similar to the one on The latter was associated with a rung up PI oscillation near kHz There's no clear statement about whether that was also the case during the former We have a long row of almost glitch subjects during the former we haven't yet seen any glitches that may have happened during the latter and if they produced Gravity Spy subjects then they can't have looked very similar to the present lot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3390873/ Pair of HF bursts or blip variants 93Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3189894/ Tomte blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390971/ Not no glitch ground motion coupling 41Hz Also S99974400 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390980/ Blip ssp varnish run Slightly odd shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390981/ One of these fancy blippish things entering stage right I never can remember what these are but they always remind me of the Marie Celeste at 4s anyway 03Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Flock? snr 01Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391005/ HF burst or high small thin varnish run blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391017/ I have noticed that when I add a subject to a collection and if that subject is already in the collection it is no longer flagged up in red script I deliberately sent a subject several times to one of my collections and it wasn flagged up in red script However when I looked in the collection there were no duplicates Is this something new ?

They are part of the Koi Fish glitch They are artefacts of the data processing arising when a loud short duration glitch with much of its noise near Hz interacts with the filtering that removes the ever present Hz noise from the electricity mains supplies Similarly the "lighthouse" effects arise in other subjects when a short duration glitch has enough noise near Hz where the fundamental violin modes ever present to some extent are filtered out Very loud glitches can acquire such artefacts at a number of other frequencies and will then turn into "anglerfish" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/ Thank you ZngabitanT https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/ Blip at with a tomte at which probably has its own object Also diffraction grating https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396657/ Doesn't look like the typical scattered light even with the quiet band between 20Hz The three loud glitches above that band and below 32Hz remind me of a streamlined fish and the single glitch below that band looks like a flattened 'c' https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396667/ non symmetry koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396682/ maybe 64Hz fuzzy range loud case https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396767/ Atypical koi fish tail off center at also diffraction grating above about 32Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396891/ 128Hz ripple with 'rain' above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396893/ Another Not No Glitch 41Hz Ground motion coupling Also S S S on 2024 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396948/ Fuzzy? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396951/ Richland WA earthquake Nessie 86Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396965/ Not no glitch Ground motion coupling from 41Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396974/ 52Hz ADF transient https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396979/ https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep around UTC summertime at Hanford sorry can remember what this is called Lockloss no obvious cause https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396994/ Scattered light low scattering? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396999/ Whoops At Livingston this had already started on Tuesday around UTC subjects from that day are only now emerging from my cascaded similarity searches in part because only now the search has become deep enough to reach the louder examples which had at first eluded us The tell tale range dip in the gwistat tab https online ligo org plot !

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The "Sparse Flock" is suggested to involve a central glitch with additional, nearly simultaneous glitches around it, representing a less dense arrangement than previously categorized flocks. This classification addresses the need for differentiating between densely and sparsely populated glitch groupings.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n\n### Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n1. **Scattered Light Misclassifications**: In Dataset 2, there\'s a notable discussion about the misclassification of scattered light glitches. Researchers and citizen scientists express concerns that the machine learning model currently used misclassifies different subtypes of scattered light glitches, leading to inaccurate categorizations. This ongoing issue underscores the need for refining machine learning models to distinguish between subtle variations within the scattered light glitch class.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n\n### Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects\n1. **Subclassification of Extremely Loud Glitches**: Citizens scientists in Dataset 2 discuss whether extremely loud glitches that are not as loud as the loudest known examples should be considered a separate subclass. This inquiry reflects a deeper engagement with the nuances of glitch classifications and suggests an evolving understanding of the amplitude spectrum of recorded glitches.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396198/\n\n2. **Technical Inquiries About Machine Learning Classifications**: There is an emerging discussion about the need to update the machine learning model to include new glitch classes observed in the latest data. This reflects a broader interest in how machine learning tools are applied in scientific research and a deeper curiosity about the intersection of artificial intelligence and physics research.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n\n3. **Inquiries on Data Processing Artefacts**: Questions arise about artefacts related to data processing, specifically how certain frequencies interact with the filtering techniques. This discussion indicates growing interest in the technical aspects of data handling and the effects of processing on the interpretation of glitches.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/\n\n### Hypotheses About Glitch Origins\n1. **Environmental Influences and Sensor Noise**: In Dataset 2, there is a hypothesis that certain glitches might be linked to environmental factors affecting the sensors, such as "fuzzy range" episodes potentially tied to medium frequency noise in the environment. This hypothesis is driven by observations of coinciding external conditions and glitch occurrences, suggesting a relationship between environmental noise and observed data anomalies.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162/\n\n### Sensor-Specific Questions or Thoughts\n1. **Sensor-Specific Glitch Occurrences**: In Dataset 2, discussions surface about whether certain glitches are specifically associated with particular sensors or detector sites. For example, there is a conversation about glitches that appear predominantly at one LIGO site but not the other, leading to questions about site-specific environmental influences or sensor configurations.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/\n\nThis analysis highlights how citizen scientists are not only expanding the catalog of glitch classifications but also engaging in more sophisticated discussions about the technical and environmental factors influencing gravitational wave detection.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The description points to an interesting dynamic where glitches almost merge into a single visual but maintain distinct origins. This exemplifies the evolving complexity in glitch categorization. *(URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146)*\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - **Inadequacy in Machine Learning Classifications:** There are concerns about the machine learning model misclassifying certain glitch types, particularly "Scattered Light," into overly broad categories. This issue highlights the ongoing challenges in refining automated classification systems to better match the nuanced observations of citizen scientists. *(URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349)*\n   - **Variability Within Known Classes:** Discussions in Dataset 2 highlight uncertainties about classifying variations within known glitch types such as "Wheatgrass" and "Flock". The community is actively debating whether certain observed features should lead to new subclassifications or refined definitions for existing classes. *(URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170)*\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science:**\n   - **Complexity of Glitch Interactions:** Questions are raised about how multiple glitches interact and whether these interactions could signify underlying physical phenomena or artifacts of data processing. This curiosity drives deeper inquiry into the nature of gravitational wave data. *(URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170)*\n   - **Impact of Environmental Factors on Glitches:** There\'s an emerging dialogue on how local environmental conditions could influence the frequency and characteristics of glitches. This line of questioning reflects a growing understanding of the delicate balance in gravitational wave detection. *(URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396994)*\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Causal Connection Between Squeezer Subsystems and Glitches:** A hypothesis discussed is that variations in the squeezer subsystems might be affecting the interferometer’s performance, especially focusing on medium frequencies. The analytical motivation involves understanding the intricate feedback loops within LIGO\'s operational mechanics, and how subsystem malfunctions might manifest as noise or glitches in the data. *(URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162)*\n\n5. **Sensor or Channel Specific Issues and Thoughts in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Localized Sensor Disturbances:** There is speculation on whether certain glitches might be specifically tied to localized disturbances or malfunctions in certain sensor arrays or channels. This contemplation stems from observations of glitches appearing during specific operational conditions or physical setups, prompting questions about causative links between observed data anomalies and specific equipment or configurations. *(URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162)*', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722317551, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_0993c4a4c0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=695, prompt_tokens=19593, total_tokens=20288))

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread!

Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled July 26th am Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you dethodav for addressing the questions It is useful to have those defining features for the Cairn class Please note that the collection Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set is still inaccessible yielding the same error message as mentioned before Edit it works now thanks!

Some further questions and remarks So I gather the point is to teach the ML about glitches that it should not label as Scattered Light but currently does while also making sure that it will still recognize subjects that are instances of "traditional" Scattered Light Will you be able to train the ML on collections of "mere" counterexamples penalizing it for misclassifications without assigning a specific other "good" class to each "this isn't Scattered Light" subject? I understand that this hasn't been possible in the past If this still isn't possible then we need to be more careful about the training sets we're going to build They should not just collect other than Scattered Light subjects but each of them should collect subjects that really belong together into a different class They should focus on core rather than fringe examples of these different classes And they should capture the essence of each of these other classes In particular they shouldn't be limited to subjects rendered at Q only when the other class under consideration has been attracting renderings at other Q values in signficant numbers I'm hopeful that Cairn will turn out to be a good if not very populous class grouping glitches together that share a common origin As far as I can see so far it will have to include examples rendered at lower Q values and it is mostly a Livingston thing "Similar" looking subjects from Hanford are numerous but are invariably something else most Scattered Light from Hanford O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3013446?comment O4b looks somewhat cairn ish except for the Q "wheatgrass" renderings On the other hand I'm sceptical about the Hz subjects The three initial gold examples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set may turn out to be three different things spanning a range of peak frequencies as reported by Omicron and one of them visibly sloping I don't think they are tied to any specific fixed frequency features spectral lines Livingston has had a few ! glitches specifically at Hz about a year ago see LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep tab is one of these that has got labeled Scattered Light with not very high confidence but others like tab got more plausibly filed under Low Frequency Lines I'm not aware of any more recent fixed frequency glitch sources at Livingston in the Hz ballpark From Hanford we have firstly the medium frequency ripples and combs tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk showing up around and and and Hz the ones peaking near Hz have occasionally received Scattered Light labels g tab but more often Low Frequency Lines tab or No Glitch tab and secondly the Hz floor motion coupling tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches could last up to several minutes at a time and often got whitened out so thoroughly that the image producing part of Gravity Spy picked a Q value at random and left us and the ML with nothing to see These subjects are still recognizable by their peak frequencies and durations but hopeless to classify purely by the resulting images tab is a rare example rendered at Q that has attracted a Scattered Light label Here too Low Frequency Lines and No Glitch occur more often Both of these glitch class proposals already link to relevant collections But the many "NotNoGlitch" examples won't do much good in training a purely image based ML They would require a more sophisticated ML which also pays attention to the Omicron metadata peak frequency duration and SNR and perhaps one which receives renderings at all four Q values as its image input not just at a single choice which may or may not match the given glitch very well I can't help noticing that all the current members of the Traditional Scattering Gold Set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with one possible exception are marginal cases of Livingston's Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk marginal in the sense that the ground was moving at somewhat less than Hz and the penduluming item excited below its resonance was able to follow the ground motion so the arches we see are spaced more than seconds apart and all of them are Q renderings The glitch subclass proposal already links to a more representative candidate training set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant training set l a dot hz scattering from O4a These glitches have not changed much between O4a and O4b But apropos of this another question springs to mind Many of these Hz scattering glitches stay below the Hz band of loud stationary noise and thus do less harm to clean observing time than those which do show up loudly above Hz As long as we're aiming to classify by common causes and common coupling paths they all belong together Nevertheless would it make sense to maintain a distinction between very low frequency Scattered Light peak frequency below Hz and the more harmful sort peak above Hz ?

If such in which way should we ascertain that we are looking at the same origin? SIm search still does not provide event time values while not every event is recorded in the log books So perhaps by matching SNR and duration between representative events? The useful glitch plotter cannot be used with unpublished data to visualize different renderings Other ways to be recalled? If there is no particular answer for then should all Q value renderings that look like Cairn within the pre defined frequency duration set of values above be collected perhaps in further subdivided collections according to Q ? Edit I reviewed notes from what I recalled now so that from the four Q values used the one that yields the highest SNR is used to render the spectrogram Many thanks!

Another fuzzy? Or a Cairn that happened to happen by pure chance in the middle of that Fuzzy Range episode? Your guess is as good as mine Well my train of thought at this very initial stage of affairs as to why not Cairn and also after looking at the Fuzzy link provided Well above Hz If they are mixed it is very difficult to discern visually Detached part or concomitant non related glitch I feel that the Cairn morphology after the real cairns seems to or is desired to form a pyramid shape mainly seen in frame which the subject in question does not form As if Fuzzy well not sure as they seem to be taller in general though it may fit the other characteristics defined for such class So I would venture not Cairns and perhaps Fuzzy or mixed undefined Thanks again for this interesting conversation Once I post my initial findings in collections more will be hopefully clarified and further defined Thanks a lot! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Many thanks for your comments and follow on questions! As to the definition of Cairns the provided golden set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set includes examples where the bright parts reach up to about Hz the lower cutoff at about Hz is determined by the upper edge of the loud but whitened away from sight stationary noise band and the visible durations usually exceed seconds and can reach about seconds The durations reported by Omicron can be even longer sometimes exceeding seconds In this regard I guess we should do as dethodav does not as dethodav says Now having looked at many subjects in the past and having used the glitch plotter on O and earlier subjects imagine what a lower Q rendering would do to such a glitch It is impossible to predict the precise shape the Q transform is a projection it loses information but we can foretell that there'll be somewhat less stretching of the overall shape in the horizontal direction and somewhat more in the vertical direction so the visible durations will tend to be a bit shorter while the vertical extent may then stick out a bit beyond the Hz range the more so the lower the Q value is chosen I haven't yet found convincing examples at Q or but I'm keeping my eyes open I've recently had to deal with all those "fuzzy range" subjects which can get rendered at any old Q so my brain is currently flooded with illustrations of how the rendering choice affects the appearance of an underlying population that's intrinsically uniform with some variability One reason why I said up front that lower Q examples of Cairns must exist is that I had already run into several candidates a few weeks ago including and as by catch during similarity searches based on other kinds of subjects I didn't immediately know what to do with them and didn't yet have a name for them and moreover I was very busy with other things that needed urgent attention Thus for a while these candidates were left sitting in very different corners of my queues not wanting to neatly fit anywhere I'm now digging through all these odd corners and trying to re unite the puzzle pieces that now suddenly seem to belong together It's certainly true that lower Q renderings of cairns are going to look a bit less like their namesakes I'm also having another look at possible "around Hz" non arching glitches from Livingston I may be able to come up with a few more probably not very many though https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thanks again for the follow up and visualizations Succinctly a We extend Cairn to the Hz range and up to about correct?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The description suggests these glitches are akin to cairns (piles of rocks), which may appear more as scattered noise without a distinct pattern typically seen in other scattering-related glitches. This glitch class reflects an attempt to refine the categorization of scattered light phenomena to better fit observed data patterns. URLs: [Cairn Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349)\n\n2. **Concerns with Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - **Scattered Light classification issues**: In Talk Dataset 2, there is a detailed discussion about the inadequacy of the Scattered Light classification. It is noted that various subclasses within what is currently categorized broadly as Scattered Light are being incorrectly grouped, leading to calls for a more nuanced categorization. This concern highlights ongoing challenges in accurately classifying glitches that may share superficial similarities but differ significantly in their underlying characteristics. URLs: [Scattered Light Issues](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349)\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Science:**\n   - **Questions about the "Cairn" glitch type**: Citizen scientists are eager to understand whether the newly proposed Cairn glitch type correlates with specific sensor outputs or environmental conditions. This reflects a deepening engagement with the data, where participants are not just classifying but also seeking to understand the physical or technical origins of the glitches they observe. URLs: [Cairn Glitch Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349)\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Environmental influences and hardware issues**: In Talk Dataset 2, there\'s a hypothesis that a \'fuzzy range\' glitch could be linked to specific environmental conditions or hardware instabilities, specifically mentioning a "single cable that was almost fully plugged in and not fully fastened" affecting the data. This reflects a more targeted understanding of how minor setup issues can lead to significant data anomalies. URLs: [Environmental Influence Hypothesis](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162)\n\n5. **Sensor or Channel Specific Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Inquiries about specific detectors\' roles in observed glitches**: Citizen scientists are querying whether certain glitches are predominantly associated with specific LIGO detectors (e.g., Livingston vs. Hanford). They discuss whether the same glitches appear across both sites or are isolated to one, indicating an attempt to link glitches to particular sensor behavior or localized environmental factors.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow? I'll be travelling tomorrow and may not be able to follow up further before Friday https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Well spotted! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3398448/ Yes well noted The Livingston engineers are still hunting for the cause They haven't yet used the word "fuzzy" to describe this phenomenon instead calling it " Hz monster" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep or "Big ugly" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ I hope big ugly isn the sensitive type! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ Surely not given what it's been doing to LLO's sensitivity curve !

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread!

Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled July 26th am Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you dethodav for addressing the questions It is useful to have those defining features for the Cairn class Please note that the collection Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set is still inaccessible yielding the same error message as mentioned before Edit it works now thanks!

Some further questions and remarks So I gather the point is to teach the ML about glitches that it should not label as Scattered Light but currently does while also making sure that it will still recognize subjects that are instances of "traditional" Scattered Light Will you be able to train the ML on collections of "mere" counterexamples penalizing it for misclassifications without assigning a specific other "good" class to each "this isn't Scattered Light" subject? I understand that this hasn't been possible in the past If this still isn't possible then we need to be more careful about the training sets we're going to build They should not just collect other than Scattered Light subjects but each of them should collect subjects that really belong together into a different class They should focus on core rather than fringe examples of these different classes And they should capture the essence of each of these other classes In particular they shouldn't be limited to subjects rendered at Q only when the other class under consideration has been attracting renderings at other Q values in signficant numbers I'm hopeful that Cairn will turn out to be a good if not very populous class grouping glitches together that share a common origin As far as I can see so far it will have to include examples rendered at lower Q values and it is mostly a Livingston thing "Similar" looking subjects from Hanford are numerous but are invariably something else most Scattered Light from Hanford O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3013446?comment O4b looks somewhat cairn ish except for the Q "wheatgrass" renderings On the other hand I'm sceptical about the Hz subjects The three initial gold examples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set may turn out to be three different things spanning a range of peak frequencies as reported by Omicron and one of them visibly sloping I don't think they are tied to any specific fixed frequency features spectral lines Livingston has had a few ! glitches specifically at Hz about a year ago see LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep tab is one of these that has got labeled Scattered Light with not very high confidence but others like tab got more plausibly filed under Low Frequency Lines I'm not aware of any more recent fixed frequency glitch sources at Livingston in the Hz ballpark From Hanford we have firstly the medium frequency ripples and combs tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk showing up around and and and Hz the ones peaking near Hz have occasionally received Scattered Light labels g tab but more often Low Frequency Lines tab or No Glitch tab and secondly the Hz floor motion coupling tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches could last up to several minutes at a time and often got whitened out so thoroughly that the image producing part of Gravity Spy picked a Q value at random and left us and the ML with nothing to see These subjects are still recognizable by their peak frequencies and durations but hopeless to classify purely by the resulting images tab is a rare example rendered at Q that has attracted a Scattered Light label Here too Low Frequency Lines and No Glitch occur more often Both of these glitch class proposals already link to relevant collections But the many "NotNoGlitch" examples won't do much good in training a purely image based ML They would require a more sophisticated ML which also pays attention to the Omicron metadata peak frequency duration and SNR and perhaps one which receives renderings at all four Q values as its image input not just at a single choice which may or may not match the given glitch very well I can't help noticing that all the current members of the Traditional Scattering Gold Set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with one possible exception are marginal cases of Livingston's Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk marginal in the sense that the ground was moving at somewhat less than Hz and the penduluming item excited below its resonance was able to follow the ground motion so the arches we see are spaced more than seconds apart and all of them are Q renderings The glitch subclass proposal already links to a more representative candidate training set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant training set l a dot hz scattering from O4a These glitches have not changed much between O4a and O4b But apropos of this another question springs to mind Many of these Hz scattering glitches stay below the Hz band of loud stationary noise and thus do less harm to clean observing time than those which do show up loudly above Hz As long as we're aiming to classify by common causes and common coupling paths they all belong together Nevertheless would it make sense to maintain a distinction between very low frequency Scattered Light peak frequency below Hz and the more harmful sort peak above Hz ?

If such in which way should we ascertain that we are looking at the same origin? SIm search still does not provide event time values while not every event is recorded in the log books So perhaps by matching SNR and duration between representative events? The useful glitch plotter cannot be used with unpublished data to visualize different renderings Other ways to be recalled? If there is no particular answer for then should all Q value renderings that look like Cairn within the pre defined frequency duration set of values above be collected perhaps in further subdivided collections according to Q ? Edit I reviewed notes from what I recalled now so that from the four Q values used the one that yields the highest SNR is used to render the spectrogram Many thanks!

Another fuzzy? Or a Cairn that happened to happen by pure chance in the middle of that Fuzzy Range episode? Your guess is as good as mine Well my train of thought at this very initial stage of affairs as to why not Cairn and also after looking at the Fuzzy link provided Well above Hz If they are mixed it is very difficult to discern visually Detached part or concomitant non related glitch I feel that the Cairn morphology after the real cairns seems to or is desired to form a pyramid shape mainly seen in frame which the subject in question does not form As if Fuzzy well not sure as they seem to be taller in general though it may fit the other characteristics defined for such class So I would venture not Cairns and perhaps Fuzzy or mixed undefined Thanks again for this interesting conversation Once I post my initial findings in collections more will be hopefully clarified and further defined Thanks a lot! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Many thanks for your comments and follow on questions! As to the definition of Cairns the provided golden set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set includes examples where the bright parts reach up to about Hz the lower cutoff at about Hz is determined by the upper edge of the loud but whitened away from sight stationary noise band and the visible durations usually exceed seconds and can reach about seconds The durations reported by Omicron can be even longer sometimes exceeding seconds In this regard I guess we should do as dethodav does not as dethodav says Now having looked at many subjects in the past and having used the glitch plotter on O and earlier subjects imagine what a lower Q rendering would do to such a glitch It is impossible to predict the precise shape the Q transform is a projection it loses information but we can foretell that there'll be somewhat less stretching of the overall shape in the horizontal direction and somewhat more in the vertical direction so the visible durations will tend to be a bit shorter while the vertical extent may then stick out a bit beyond the Hz range the more so the lower the Q value is chosen I haven't yet found convincing examples at Q or but I'm keeping my eyes open I've recently had to deal with all those "fuzzy range" subjects which can get rendered at any old Q so my brain is currently flooded with illustrations of how the rendering choice affects the appearance of an underlying population that's intrinsically uniform with some variability One reason why I said up front that lower Q examples of Cairns must exist is that I had already run into several candidates a few weeks ago including and as by catch during similarity searches based on other kinds of subjects I didn't immediately know what to do with them and didn't yet have a name for them and moreover I was very busy with other things that needed urgent attention Thus for a while these candidates were left sitting in very different corners of my queues not wanting to neatly fit anywhere I'm now digging through all these odd corners and trying to re unite the puzzle pieces that now suddenly seem to belong together It's certainly true that lower Q renderings of cairns are going to look a bit less like their namesakes I'm also having another look at possible "around Hz" non arching glitches from Livingston I may be able to come up with a few more probably not very many though https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thanks again for the follow up and visualizations Succinctly a We extend Cairn to the Hz range and up to about correct?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Cairn Glitches:** This new class is highlighted due to its unique appearance that somewhat resembles piled rocks, lacking a clear arch structure common to traditional scattered light glitches. These glitches seem to bridge the gap between traditional scattered light and another unnamed class, hinting at a unique origin or behavior within the LIGO detectors. They are identified as a challenge for the machine learning model used in Gravity Spy, necessitating retraining to differentiate them from similar-looking glitches.\n   - **Hz Glitches:** Identified as a single line of noise near 1080 Hz, these are distinct from other noise lines and are currently misclassified by automated systems. This class is particularly interesting as it represents a frequency-specific anomaly that might be linked to specific mechanical or environmental factors within the observatories.\n   - **URLs influencing response:** \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/dethodav/hz-gold-set\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/dethodav/cairn-gold-set\n\n**2. Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - **Scattered Light Misclassifications:** There is significant concern that multiple types of glitches are being erroneously classified under the broad category of 'Scattered Light'. This includes new subclasses like Cairn and Hz glitches which, while sharing some superficial characteristics with scattered light, have unique aspects that are currently overlooked by classification algorithms.\n   - **URLs influencing response:** \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n\n**3. Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science:**\n   - **Classification Accuracy and Machine Learning:** Scientists and contributors are querying the accuracy of current machine learning models used in classifying glitches, especially with the introduction of new glitch types. There is a growing interest in understanding how these models can be improved to distinguish between subtly different glitch types more effectively.\n   - **Technical Aspects of Glitches:** Questions are emerging about the specific characteristics that define each glitch class, such as frequency range, duration, and appearance in spectrograms.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled July 26th am Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you dethodav for addressing the questions It is useful to have those defining features for the Cairn class Please note that the collection Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set is still inaccessible yielding the same error message as mentioned before Edit it works now thanks!

Some further questions and remarks So I gather the point is to teach the ML about glitches that it should not label as Scattered Light but currently does while also making sure that it will still recognize subjects that are instances of "traditional" Scattered Light Will you be able to train the ML on collections of "mere" counterexamples penalizing it for misclassifications without assigning a specific other "good" class to each "this isn't Scattered Light" subject? I understand that this hasn't been possible in the past If this still isn't possible then we need to be more careful about the training sets we're going to build They should not just collect other than Scattered Light subjects but each of them should collect subjects that really belong together into a different class They should focus on core rather than fringe examples of these different classes And they should capture the essence of each of these other classes In particular they shouldn't be limited to subjects rendered at Q only when the other class under consideration has been attracting renderings at other Q values in signficant numbers I'm hopeful that Cairn will turn out to be a good if not very populous class grouping glitches together that share a common origin As far as I can see so far it will have to include examples rendered at lower Q values and it is mostly a Livingston thing "Similar" looking subjects from Hanford are numerous but are invariably something else most Scattered Light from Hanford O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3013446?comment O4b looks somewhat cairn ish except for the Q "wheatgrass" renderings On the other hand I'm sceptical about the Hz subjects The three initial gold examples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set may turn out to be three different things spanning a range of peak frequencies as reported by Omicron and one of them visibly sloping I don't think they are tied to any specific fixed frequency features spectral lines Livingston has had a few ! glitches specifically at Hz about a year ago see LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep tab is one of these that has got labeled Scattered Light with not very high confidence but others like tab got more plausibly filed under Low Frequency Lines I'm not aware of any more recent fixed frequency glitch sources at Livingston in the Hz ballpark From Hanford we have firstly the medium frequency ripples and combs tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk showing up around and and and Hz the ones peaking near Hz have occasionally received Scattered Light labels g tab but more often Low Frequency Lines tab or No Glitch tab and secondly the Hz floor motion coupling tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches could last up to several minutes at a time and often got whitened out so thoroughly that the image producing part of Gravity Spy picked a Q value at random and left us and the ML with nothing to see These subjects are still recognizable by their peak frequencies and durations but hopeless to classify purely by the resulting images tab is a rare example rendered at Q that has attracted a Scattered Light label Here too Low Frequency Lines and No Glitch occur more often Both of these glitch class proposals already link to relevant collections But the many "NotNoGlitch" examples won't do much good in training a purely image based ML They would require a more sophisticated ML which also pays attention to the Omicron metadata peak frequency duration and SNR and perhaps one which receives renderings at all four Q values as its image input not just at a single choice which may or may not match the given glitch very well I can't help noticing that all the current members of the Traditional Scattering Gold Set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with one possible exception are marginal cases of Livingston's Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk marginal in the sense that the ground was moving at somewhat less than Hz and the penduluming item excited below its resonance was able to follow the ground motion so the arches we see are spaced more than seconds apart and all of them are Q renderings The glitch subclass proposal already links to a more representative candidate training set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant training set l a dot hz scattering from O4a These glitches have not changed much between O4a and O4b But apropos of this another question springs to mind Many of these Hz scattering glitches stay below the Hz band of loud stationary noise and thus do less harm to clean observing time than those which do show up loudly above Hz As long as we're aiming to classify by common causes and common coupling paths they all belong together Nevertheless would it make sense to maintain a distinction between very low frequency Scattered Light peak frequency below Hz and the more harmful sort peak above Hz ?

If such in which way should we ascertain that we are looking at the same origin? SIm search still does not provide event time values while not every event is recorded in the log books So perhaps by matching SNR and duration between representative events? The useful glitch plotter cannot be used with unpublished data to visualize different renderings Other ways to be recalled? If there is no particular answer for then should all Q value renderings that look like Cairn within the pre defined frequency duration set of values above be collected perhaps in further subdivided collections according to Q ? Edit I reviewed notes from what I recalled now so that from the four Q values used the one that yields the highest SNR is used to render the spectrogram Many thanks! Kindy refresh this page as I made edits thank you https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ I was unsure about this subject because of the tail I selected blip but I wanted to Ask info about the tail I read the info already available and they are quite useful https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/2994709/ Huh this is a weird combination of symptoms So it's got nothing to do with new FEM versus old PFE frontend since another FEM project works for you and it affects two different makes of browsers on two devices but not to our knowledge any other users with iPads or MacBooks And moreover if you've been contributing to Gravity Spy on and off for several years there should now be more workflows unlocked for your account beyond the first Summoning one of our researchers Kevin crowston are you able to see anything peculiar on the Gravity Spy project side about the icecreamdoc user account numerical Zooniverse user ID ?

Well I am not convinced here not yet disagree based on the frequency range going far above the approximate Hz per definition and according to the golden set provided they stay the brightest below 64Hz But as we know well variations abound Regarding > One notable difference is that Cairns won't repeat within the bounds of the fourth frames while the Hanford glitches often do at a cadence of about seconds or shorter This is a great point to start differentiating between those Thanks! Then > All of these non examples were returned by a single Similarity Search anchored on one of the given gold standard Cairns I also ran this subject as seed today asking for just results got H and one L with most of the H ones repeating themselves when zoomed out Then > That said I would not yet rule out the possibility that Cairns arise in a similar way it might yet turn out that they really are another form of Scattered Light Alright if the arches go below Hz and dishevelment shows up I may initially stick to the range Hz staying below Hz to see what it yields through cascading searches all within the 5s duration so very few of such returned by sim search Your next question > Anyways Here are some examples of what may be Cairns rendered at Q the first is a bit iffy What do you think? I think that it is nightmare At Q they obviously do not resemble the Q counterparts how are we determining if the former are Cairn when we do not know the trigger? If we need to mainly visualize Cairns and then go deeper into values distribution comparisons and so forth with the mere tools I have on this side sim search not giving event time and clearly no new data released yet for use with the plotter well I would say that I might stick for a while to Q value and build on those deemed fit See where it goes form here Your last question > Now where would you place the next one below? Another fuzzy? Or a Cairn that happened to happen by pure chance in the middle of that Fuzzy Range episode? Your guess is as good as mine Well my train of thought at this very initial stage of affairs as to why not Cairn and also after looking at the Fuzzy link provided Well above Hz If they are mixed it is very difficult to discern visually Detached part or concomitant non related glitch I feel that the Cairn morphology after the real cairns seems to or is desired to form a pyramid shape mainly seen in frame which the subject in question does not form As if Fuzzy well not sure as they seem to be taller in general though it may fit the other characteristics defined for such class So I would venture not Cairns and perhaps Fuzzy or mixed undefined Thanks again for this interesting conversation Once I post my initial findings in collections more will be hopefully clarified and further defined Thanks a lot! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Many thanks for your comments and follow on questions! As to the definition of Cairns the provided golden set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set includes examples where the bright parts reach up to about Hz the lower cutoff at about Hz is determined by the upper edge of the loud but whitened away from sight stationary noise band and the visible durations usually exceed seconds and can reach about seconds The durations reported by Omicron can be even longer sometimes exceeding seconds In this regard I guess we should do as dethodav does not as dethodav says Now having looked at many subjects in the past and having used the glitch plotter on O and earlier subjects imagine what a lower Q rendering would do to such a glitch It is impossible to predict the precise shape the Q transform is a projection it loses information but we can foretell that there'll be somewhat less stretching of the overall shape in the horizontal direction and somewhat more in the vertical direction so the visible durations will tend to be a bit shorter while the vertical extent may then stick out a bit beyond the Hz range the more so the lower the Q value is chosen I haven't yet found convincing examples at Q or but I'm keeping my eyes open I've recently had to deal with all those "fuzzy range" subjects which can get rendered at any old Q so my brain is currently flooded with illustrations of how the rendering choice affects the appearance of an underlying population that's intrinsically uniform with some variability One reason why I said up front that lower Q examples of Cairns must exist is that I had already run into several candidates a few weeks ago including and as by catch during similarity searches based on other kinds of subjects I didn't immediately know what to do with them and didn't yet have a name for them and moreover I was very busy with other things that needed urgent attention Thus for a while these candidates were left sitting in very different corners of my queues not wanting to neatly fit anywhere I'm now digging through all these odd corners and trying to re unite the puzzle pieces that now suddenly seem to belong together It's certainly true that lower Q renderings of cairns are going to look a bit less like their namesakes I'm also having another look at possible "around Hz" non arching glitches from Livingston I may be able to come up with a few more probably not very many though https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thanks again for the follow up and visualizations Succinctly a We extend Cairn to the Hz range and up to about correct?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

These glitches are described by their occurrence predominantly at certain frequencies and are marked by a less defined, "fuzzy" appearance on the spectograms. They are speculated to be associated with environmental or instrumental influences causing broad frequency spectrum disturbances.\n   - URL: [Fuzzy Range Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3401049/)\n\n2. **Cairn Glitches**: This newly identified glitch class is named "Cairn." Described as resembling pyramid-shaped configurations in the spectral plots, these glitches seem to be distinct in their manifestation. Citizen scientists have noted these glitches have a broad frequency response, often appearing in clusters, leading to the metaphorical naming after stone cairns.\n   - URL: [Cairn Glitches Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/)\n\n### Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n\n1. **Confusion over Scattered Light Classification**: In Talk Dataset 2, concerns are raised regarding the classification of scattered light glitches. Citizen scientists discuss potential misclassifications where glitches labeled as scattered light do not exhibit typical characteristics, suggesting a need for refined criteria or additional subclass distinctions within this category.\n   - URL: [Scattered Light Concerns](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/)\n\n### Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science\n\n1. **Questions on Glitch Origins**: Citizen scientists in Talk Dataset 2 express a deeper curiosity about the origins of specific glitches, such as whether certain patterns can be consistently linked to known environmental factors or instrument behaviors. This reflects a growing desire to understand not just the classification but also the causative factors behind observed data anomalies.\n   - URL: [Origin Questioning](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400908/)\n\n2. **Technical Inquiry about Sensors**: There are emerging discussions about the specific sensors or components within the LIGO detectors that might be particularly sensitive or prone to capturing certain glitches. These questions show a more technical engagement with the hardware aspect of gravitational wave detection.\n   - URL: [Sensor Specific Inquiry](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/)\n\n3. **Learning Classifications and Data Analysis**: Questions arise on how to better utilize tools like the Zooniverse platform for classifying and analyzing glitches. This points to a broader educational pursuit among citizen scientists to gain skills in data handling and interpretation relevant to gravitational wave science.\n   - URL: [Learning Classifications](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3403507/)\n\n### Hypotheses on Glitch Origins\n\n1. **Environmental Influences on Glitch Occurrences**: In Talk Dataset 2, there are more nuanced discussions about how environmental conditions such as seismic activities or human-made disturbances might correspond with the timing and characteristics of certain glitches. These hypotheses are motivated by observed correlations between external events and data anomalies, suggesting potential areas for further scientific investigation.\n   - URL: [Environmental Hypotheses](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/)\n\n### Questions Concerning Sensors and Channels\n\n1. **Specific Sensor Concerns**: New discussions in Talk Dataset 2 suggest a growing interest in how particular sensors or channels might influence the frequency and type of glitches detected. This includes questions about whether specific instruments or setups might be more susceptible to certain environmental influences or technical errors.\n   - URL: [Sensor Concerns](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402079/)', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722523968, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_0993c4a4c0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=838, prompt_tokens=17463, total_tokens=18301))
