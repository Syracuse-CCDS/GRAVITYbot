User Prompt: 
    For the following text data, provide a list of primary topics of the data:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst? Maybe even a combination of glitches? maybe #scatteredlight :)
Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

    For the following text data, provide a list of primary topics of the data:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst? Maybe even a combination of glitches? maybe #scatteredlight :)
Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with

- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

User Prompt: 
    For the following text data, provide a list of primary topics of the data:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst? Maybe even a combination of glitches? maybe #scatteredlight :)
Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk762917436 and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these glitches that isnt well understood yet Youre very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now Hanford Fireballish with

regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organprojectszooniversegravityspycollectionszngabitantloudblipgroupsymmetricwithkoigrandorgan Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicm25 has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450189 looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450234 looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450218 firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame

often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other

arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening 50324234 frame

together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency

recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm25 The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nicm25 I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy

repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk762917436 and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these glitches that isnt well understood yet Youre very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now Hanford Fireballish with

regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organprojectszooniversegravityspycollectionszngabitantloudblipgroupsymmetricwithkoigrandorgan Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicm25 has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450189 looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450234 looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450218 firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame

often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other

arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening 50324234 frame

together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency

recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm25 The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nicm25 I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362094/ The Machine Learning part of Gravity Spy thinks of this and similar subjects as Low Frequency Lines based on how it had been trained in the past But they aren't "lines" in the spectral line sense tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk They are high Q renderings of very low frequency Scattered Light arches cut off below either by the Hz bottom edge or already at Hz by always very loud background noise and cut off above by ever present loud background noise in the Hz band The background noise gets suppressed in our images At Livingston during O4a and O4b so far such very low frequency glitches account for more subjects than everything else put together which isn't quite obvious when classifying them here on Zooniverse due to the peculiar ways how subjects get distributed across the workflow levels From the point of view of how they are caused I've been leaning towards calling them Scattered Light From a practical point of view however it might make sense to keep them separate from Scattered Light glitches that rise above the Hz noise band into the Hz region where they do more harm to clean observing time than down there near the bottom edge even though it's one kind of glitch caused by one and the same kind of mechanism just a difference in how fast the reflecting item was moving at the time Our current classification scheme doesn't capture these aspects very well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3361831/ NOTA unknown 60Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362310/ "NotNoGlitch" There had to be noise at least a factor of above the background in order to trigger a Gravity Spy subject and extracting these data for the present S with the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search we find an SNR of peak frequency Hz and duration of seconds as recorded by the glitch detection software Omicron So this is really going to be very low frequency Scattered Light but the Hz bottom edge of our images is dark purple Now that is a hint that something even louder must have been happening either before or usually afterwards so it's worth checking also the approximate time after UTC from the hours wide rectangle centered on it as displayed by a Sim Search asking for a single result and then heading to the logbook tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG and the status summary pages tab https gwosc org detector status The status page for tab https gwosc org detector status day includes a plot of the observing segments on that date !

    Now consider Talk Dataset 2:
     Extremely loud but interesting due to the loud high frequency static https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ A ripple comb with some interesting shapes that are louder than the rest including the squashed at the and the paired lines between and https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365862/ Well observed and an interesting example ! Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367332/ It looks like repeating blips going into a koi fish though the blips might be a wheatgrass glitch instead given they seem to be joined together Also the parentheses around the koi fish are interesting https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/ Could be a really wide ripple comb or a series of subtle scattered light over a wide frequency band that seems to be descending in frequency along the leading edge https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/ is this still koi fish? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/ Looks like a ripple comb coming to a end louder than the earlier part of the comb shown https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/ Scattered Light and more Scattered Light these are two successive stacks of parallel arches each with the top of a lower arch around Hz and a "cap" or "eyebrow" arch above it around Hz Usually such stacks are caused by the same stray light path being traversed more than once With each additional roundtrip the rate of change of the total path length traversed expressed as number of laser wavelengths per second and thus giving the frequency at which the noise will show up increases by a similar amount https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367332/ Good question I'm not sure what to make of this It's either a single group or "flock" lasting about seconds and ending with a smallish Koi Fish or a flock of blips lasting only seconds centered around time seconds followed by a separate smallish Koi Fish by coincidence https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/ A bit of a head scratcher thinking The central Koi Fish may be part of the flock of blips that starts around time seconds or else it might be an independent glitch appearing next to it by sheer coincidence Either way the parentheses are part of the Koi's "fins" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/ Another nice example from this lot tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Plus a little stack of scattered light archlets around time seconds unusually neatly shaped as Hanford O scattered light goes which often looks rather messier Sometimes it's much easier to assign a glitch to a population taking into account when it had happened and what else had been happening around the same time and then the entire population to a proposed class than to classify each individual subject separately especially when as in this case the individual examples show quite a lot of variability https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/ I would file this under moderately messy Scattered Light Hanford O style By the time late November the present S got recorded the medium frequency ripple comb glitches that had been common from mid July onwards had become rare again at Hanford For comparison here's a late MF ripple S from October fourth frames of the two subjects side by side both rendered at Q ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location f 733d 42da 8b 097033091dc png ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 7f a c a 4ff c 20354 f dd png The differences can be subtle The ripples tend ed to last much longer than four seconds at a time we usually see only pieces of them Hanford O Scattered Light features at typically slightly lower frequencies usually form shorter groups each group lasting about seconds Only on a few exceptional days did they continue beyond both the left and right edges The Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search also helps here The MF ripples almost always have peak frequencies near or or or Hz Scattered Light glitches mostly live at somewhat lower frequencies and once they manage to rise above the Hz background noise band they do not prefer any particular narrow frequency bands since the frequencies at which they show up are dictated by how fast the reflecting item is moving at any given moment which varies on a continuous scale https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/

    - 1400 Ripple 
    - 70 Hz Line 
    - Air Compressor (50 Hz)
    - Blip

    - Tomte 
    - Uncategorized_Glitches 
    - Violin Mode Harmonic 
    - Wandering Line 
    - Whistle 

    Below are a list of things I would like an answer for. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

This class is suggested due to the observed patterns that resemble a grouping or cluster of similar glitch shapes, termed "blips," which seem to occur in a sequence or batch. This collective appearance suggests a distinctive class that might warrant separate categorization from individual blips due to its nature and the possible underlying causes that lead to such clustered appearances.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n**Answer 2: Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes**\n\nIn Talk Dataset 2, there is a noticeable questioning regarding the classification adequacy of certain glitches. For instance, there\'s a discussion about whether certain observed phenomena should be classified as "wheat grass" or another class due to the appearance of a glitch that looks like a koi fish made of smaller koi fish. This reflects a broader concern about whether existing classifications comprehensively cover the spectrum of observed glitches or if they need refinement to accommodate new observations.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/\n\n**Answer 3: Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects**\n\nIn Talk Dataset 2, questions arise about the nature of some glitches and their classification. For instance, there\'s a query whether a particular pattern forms part of a "flock of blips" or if it stands as an independent glitch. This questioning goes deeper into understanding the categorization rules and characteristics that define different glitch classes, reflecting an ongoing learning process about the granularity and distinctions between different types of glitches.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n**Answer 4: Hypotheses About Glitch Origins**\n\nTalk Dataset 2 contains specific hypotheses concerning the origins of glitches. Several discussions hypothesize environmental factors impacting the sensors, such as external vibrations from seismic activity potentially causing locklosses and influencing the glitches observed. For instance, an earthquake near Tonga discussed might have caused specific glitches due to seismic waves influencing the detector.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362604/\n\n**Answer 5: Questions Concerning Connections to Sensors or Channels**\n\nThere\'s a discussion in Talk Dataset 2 about whether the observed glitches, specifically the categories and shapes like "scattered light," are linked to particular sensors or channels, especially when they resemble shapes or patterns known to be caused by specific sensor actions or malfunctions. This includes wondering about the impact of sensor changes and configurations, like the shift from ETMY to ETMX, which could influence the types and appearances of glitches observed.\n\n- URL related to response: httpsid: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1720383892, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_486730399b', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=642, prompt_tokens=5281, total_tokens=5923))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    Below are a list of things I would like an answer for. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

     Extremely loud but interesting due to the loud high frequency static https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ A ripple comb with some interesting shapes that are louder than the rest including the squashed at the and the paired lines between and https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365862/ Well observed and an interesting example ! Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    Below are a list of things I would like an answer for. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

They describe this as a group or "flock" lasting about 10 seconds and ending with a smallish Koi Fish, or as a separate event consisting of a flock of blips lasting only 4 seconds. This description suggests a distinct pattern or clustering of blips, differentiating it from other known classes.\n   - URLs: \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - Citizen scientists express concerns about the general categorization and the effectiveness of the machine learning (ML) in accurately capturing the essence of certain glitches. They discuss the limitations of ML classifications in dealing with new or nuanced types of glitches. They suggest that some glitches might span multiple classifications or not fit neatly into existing ones based on their observed characteristics and behaviors.\n   - URLs:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are emerging questions about whether certain observed patterns are independent glitches or part of a larger, connected event. For example, discussions around whether a central Koi Fish is part of a flock of blips or an independent glitch signify an inquiry into the connectivity and interaction of different glitch types.\n   - URLs:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Citizen scientists hypothesize that the visible frequency band of glitches might be influenced by environmental conditions like seismic activities or operational changes in the interferometers. For instance, they correlate a lockloss event and subsequent glitches with an earthquake in Mexico, analyzing how external seismic activities could induce specific glitches.\n   - Another hypothesis revolves around operational adjustments, such as changes in actuation at the Livingston observatory, potentially causing a regular pattern of glitches seen as "flock of blips."\n   - URLs:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Connection of Glitches to Specific Sensors or Channels:**\n   - Discussions in Talk Dataset 2 involve examining the relationship between glitches and specific operational changes or sensor states at observatories.

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

One notable mention is a glitch described as resembling "a koi fish made of koi fish," which suggests a recursive or self-similar structure in the glitch appearance. This description indicates an observed pattern that combines known glitch types into a potentially new, composite form. Similarly, discussions around "cuneiform type loud glitch" and "extremely wide ripple comb" suggest observations of unique spectral patterns which are not clearly classified under existing categories. These discussions showcase the citizen scientists\' active engagement in refining glitch classification based on emergent data.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367332/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a noticeable discussion about the uncertainty in categorizing certain glitches, such as whether a specific pattern should be classified as "low frequency blip" or "wheat grass." This indicates ongoing challenges and potential confusion in applying existing glitch classes accurately to observed data. The discussion suggests that existing classifications might not fully encompass the variability or nuances of observed glitch patterns, leading to uncertainty among citizen scientists.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions on Technical Aspects and Classifications:**\n   - Talk Dataset 2 includes queries about the detailed structures within observed glitches. For instance, questions about whether certain features in a glitch are part of a larger group or independent phenomena highlight a deeper dive into understanding the intricate details of glitch morphology. Such questions reflect a growing sophistication in the citizen scientists\' approach to data analysis, focusing on the interrelations and individual characteristics of glitch components.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/\n\n4. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Participants in Talk Dataset 2 hypothesize about the environmental and operational context of glitches. For instance, links between specific glitches and external events like earthquakes are explored, suggesting a direct correlation between environmental disturbances and glitch occurrences. This analysis is grounded in real-time events affecting the sensor\'s operational environment, thereby providing a contextual understanding of glitch origins.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Questions and Thoughts in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Dataset 2, there is a discussion about the potential impact of changes in sensor configurations on the observation of glitches. For example, changes in the DARM ESD actuation are speculated to influence the visibility and characteristics of glitches. This illustrates the participants\' engagement with understanding how specific technical adjustments in LIGO\'s sensor setup might affect data acquisition and glitch characteristics.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3219652/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1720393647, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_486730399b', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=837, prompt_tokens=5300, total_tokens=6137))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The description focuses on the grouped, transient nature of these glitches, suggesting a collective rather than isolated appearance in the spectrogram data. The term emphasizes the visual and possibly dynamic character of these glitches as a coherent group.\n   - **"Ripple Comb"**: This new class is proposed to describe glitches characterized by repetitive, wave-like patterns that resemble the teeth of a comb. This glitch class emphasizes the structured, periodic nature of the disturbance, potentially indicative of a repetitive or oscillatory underlying cause.\n   - URLs influencing response: \n     - Flock of Blips: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n     - Ripple Comb: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is an ongoing discussion about the appropriateness of classifying certain glitches under existing categories like "Scattered Light" and "Koi Fish". Participants express uncertainties about whether these classifications accurately capture the characteristics of the glitches observed. For example, they debate if a pattern should be classified as "Koi Fish" or merely a variation of "Wheat Grass", suggesting a need for clearer or more distinct classification criteria.\n   - URLs influencing response: \n     - Concerns on Scattered Light and Koi Fish classifications: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects**\n   - Participants in Talk Dataset 2 raise questions about the consistency of glitch appearances and their classifications. For instance, they discuss the appearance of glitches resembling "Koi Fish" and whether these should be considered as an independent class or as a variant of another class due to their similar features to other glitches.\n   - There is curiosity about the methodological aspects of glitch classification, such as how machine learning models are trained to recognize and categorize glitches, and whether these models are sufficiently adaptable to newly observed glitch types.\n   - URLs influencing response:\n     - Questions on glitch classification consistency and methodology: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2**\n   - One hypothesis discussed concerns the environmental impact on glitch occurrences, specifically how natural events like earthquakes can cause significant disruptions in sensor readings, leading to identifiable glitches in the data.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

That one is currently a bit of a junkyard due to an unfortunate combination of reasons and it currently tends to be somewhat starved of submissions too These transients near Hz belong here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk This proposed glitch class was never turned into an official classification option These glitches had happened only during three consecutive days to at Hanford and the cause had already been fixed by the time the corresponding subjects were uploaded to Zooniverse a few days later The researches had therefore intended to retire all of the roughly subjects involved but this didn't turn out to be feasible So we still keep encountering them in level to be classified like much else in this level as None Of The Above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3380401/ Not unless they should occur again They clearly form a very distinct population but the minimum required for a formal glitch class proposal would be distinct subjects and we've seen and one of our veterans has collected tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections deleteduser 1795hz exactly of them Their cause is unknown they all come from Hanford from one week in late October See also this entry tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2961842?comment in the Early Alerts thread Around that time there were recurrent issues with uploading subjects simultaneously to Zooniverse and to the Gravity Spy tools tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu resulting in many partially failed uploads and many retries By the time this was sorted out each of these glitches hat got uploaded either five or six times to Zooniverse under different subject numbers so now there are more than subjects for them altogether It has not proved practical to eliminate the duplicates from the active subjects in the level workflow the present subject is one of them All we can do for now is classify all of them as None Of The Above and I've kept indicating the duplicates by putting them into a marker collection Those with subject numbers 9287xxxx 9289xxxx 9302xxxx 9327xxxx 9343xxxx are the extraneous ones where the uploads didn't fully succeed The good ones those which have become visible to the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search have 9636xxxx numbers https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3380403/ You will have noticed that the glitch mix that's been coming out of Advanced LIGO's fourth observing run O now into its second half O4b is rather different from anything we've ever seen before Blips and Koi Fish have remained recognizable with minor changes due to reduced stationary background noise Extremely Loud is still with us Violin Mode Harmonics have been seen a few times though most subjects caused by rung up violin modes look completely bland and can be recognized only by their peak frequencies in the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search combined with relevant logbook entries for the days in question On one occasion in January we've had a Wandering Line tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3275733?comment that can be traced along successive subjects for about minutes Gone we hope! are Whistles Gone are the splendid large multi arch Scattered Light subjects that were common during earlier runs the cause for them had been pinpointed in late and clever fixes applied in January before the end of O got rid of them The Field Guide Entry for Scattered Light links to a relevant paper Gone are Crowns Scattered Light is still causing the vast majority of glitches around but most of them now show up at very low frequencies and end up being classified as either Low Frequency Lines or Low Frequency Burst whereas genuine Low Frequency Lines tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are rare and don't look like much see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and genuine Low Frequency Bursts even rarer The Line absent during O may have returned or else some other cause is producing close lookalikes And all sorts of completely new things have been showing up in moderate numbers B Do keep an eye on the New Glitch Classes LIGO tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk board https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3380401/

     Well the Machine Learning has never yet been trained for these it was left to guess within the limits of its limited "imagination" But to be fair back in when the subjects from the earlier event were first showing up humans were equally mystified tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 415698?comment by them https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3370677/ After running cascaded similarity searches until my queue was exhausted I'm looking at so far subjects tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h b bike chain or hz from this heating episode I'm not sure about their chronological order in part because I can't limit the searches to O4b only but let me point out a few series of successively overlapping subjects before UTC ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 3345c 06de 4 c ec 84041 b png tab ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 28 cd adfa 48fb 9 a a png tab ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 2530 a f bec bf b png tab before ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location cae c 40c dd png tab ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location a 469d 893a 29 fd png tab around ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location b 4bdb 417d a f a png tab ! framr https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location dfe 25fd 91ea 962 bd png tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3129990/ Ah apologies to Machine Learning https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3370677/ Blip with a leading whistle type glitch leading into it centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383003/ Boot like low frequency blip centered at though it looks like it might be a part of a wheat grass Another glitch centered at which might have its own subject https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383006/ Perhaps an abnormally quiet lead up to lock loss starting at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383007/ Looks like a glimmering of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383011/ Three scattered light glitches with the suppressed band between 26Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383015/ A glimmering of koi fish or extremely loud https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383017/ Found this glitch similar to the Koi Fish glitch but in groups https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384386/ The glitch can look like it is neither a Blip nor Whistle but as time progresses it will narrow into a W shape classifying it as a Whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/224113/ It may look abnormal at first but as time progresses toward the next frames the glitch takes the form of a "W " classifying it as a whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/178209/ It takes the form of a "W" as time progresses in the next frames making it a whistle glitch with a very low normalized energy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/104145/ Although I believed it to be none of the forms I decided to finalize the classification of a koi fish due to the fact that it fits the criteria of a blip with fins wings even though the one on the right is abnormally large with higher normalized energy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/104202/ This one was tricky due to the fact that there is an abnormally large "fin" to the left with very high normalized energy but I would still classify it as a koi fish due to it meeting the criteria of being a Blip with fins wings even though one has significantly more normalized energy levels than the other https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384512/ Would there be such thing as a power line with a frequency below 60Hz? If that is possible for a glitch then I would classify it as that if not then it is possibly none of the mentioned glitch formats https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384515/ This looks like a 60Hz power line at a glance of the main glitch but it has high normalized energy in the frequencies below it as well I classified it as a power line but it could also be none of the above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384517/ I thought it was a blip at first but if you observe around the areas of the main glitch you can probably make out fins wings due to the faint normalized energy in those areas classifying it as a koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3302220/ I thought that there was no glitch at first but if you check the frames with the different time intervals you will notice the dots in the frequencies above Hz all in a vertical arrangement columns classifying it as a Violin Mode Harmonic https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/2327400/ This comment has been deleted https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/1160323/ It looks like a koi fish due to the fact that it meets the criteria of a sharp blip with fins wings If you look closely you can see the blip shape at time and the wings on the left and right sides even though they look abnormal due to the high normalized energy and weird shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/1160323/ Very very narrow "V " but it still classifies as a whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/122657/ This one is crazy it looks like there is barely any transition of normalized energy levels at around the Hz frequency like it has super high contrast To add on the fact of the weird spots at the frequencies above make this even more abnormal https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3284783/ I've seen lots of these before they always look like a power line with high normalized energy below the Hz frequency would these need new classification? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384528/ It is a scattered light because there is a faint glitch with high normalized energy at around frequency Hz and a very thick one at around frequency Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384535/ Double blip or a very very faint Koi fish? I could be wrong but I somewhat see the fins wings of the koi fish on the sides of the main blip at time 0s even though the one on the left has high normalized energy and the other has very very low normalized energy then again I could be wrong https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384536/ This is VERY similar to a power line but at very low frequency compared to the usual Hz it could classify as a power line or none of the above for me https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384538/ This looks like a very concentrated blip due to its high contrast with the normalized energy surrounding it with barely any transition from high to low https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3165364/ This may look like a very very low frequency power line but it is actually an energy burst when you move onto the more zoomed out frames with greater time intervals https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384541/ If you notice the low normalized energy line at around the frequency of Hz it may look like a high frequency line but I believe that it may be a different classification I can also see it kind of looking like a horizontal version of a violin mode harmonic but I could be wrong https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3280175/ This looks like a very long wide low frequency burst with other high normalized energy glitches in the surrounding area https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384544/ This somewhat looks like a lower frequency version of a power line https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384545/ This one looks super similar to Subject a high frequency glitch with long duration adn very low normalized energy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384547/ Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk JadenNino and thank you for contributing! Correct this is a Whistle from the first observing run in We've still had a number of Whistle glitches until the third observing run O but none yet during the ongoing fourth O O4b It's not necessary to annotate each and every subject we have far too many but please be welcome to bring up anything that's unusual or specially noteworthy or giving rise to questions! Over the years and after many upgrades to the observatories the glitch mix has changed a lot Some old glitch classes are no longer happening others have changed in appearance and completely new things are appearing now that still need investigating You'll meet quite a lot of None Of The Above as you advance through the workflows One more remark Time advances from left to right in each of our subject images The animation merely zooms out along the time axis from half a second shown in the first frame to showing four seconds' worth in the fourth frame https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/178209/ Yes this doesn't really want to fit into the available classes I would tend to calling it None Of The Above Glitches like this close irregularly spaced groups of blip like "glitchlets" with a well defined beginning and end have been happening for years but have never been very common so there isn't even a proposed glitch class yet for them They've been nicknamed flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384512/ Well noted Indeed it's not a Power Line It's quite close to Hz the noise distribution peaked at Hz It's part of a population of medium frequency glitches that first showed up in larger numbers at Hanford in mid July and since then they've gradually become rare again We have a pending glitch class proposal tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk for them The Machine Learning part of Gravity Spy did mistake this for a Power Line with high confidence At some point it will need to be retrained to recognize all the new sorts of glitches from recent years but a lot of work is still needed in this direction it will need to be done in such a way that the LIGO engineers afterwards will still be able to compare recent Machine Learning classifications to older ones from past years https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384515/ Good points! I had run into this subject almost a year ago scratched my head for a bit and settled on NOTA but now that I look at it again it could be a fringe case of a Power Line possibly together with some unrelated noise There's a little dent in it at time seconds and a little "eye" at time seconds which could correspond to the moments when some Hz noise started and ended and when the filtering that suppresses the ever present steady Hz noise from the grid mains power momentarily changed between overcompensating and undercompensating it and back https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384517/ There are two things going on here The central glitch is somewhere on the border between a rather loud Blip a Koi Fish for the faint "fins" around Hz and Extremely Loud for the more obvious "lighthouse" artefacts around Hz there are much louder examples which share these traits So it's not a clear cut classification Your vote is as good as mine here The surrounding low frequency "wheatgrass" as it has been nicknamed is unrelated a chance near coincidence and is actually caused by scattered light it's hard to recognize here due to the rendering choices very fine time resolution to bring out the central glitch to best effect at the expense of very coarse frequency resolution https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3302220/ These can be classified as Extremely Loud This subject was recorded a couple of seconds before a lockloss tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk on at UTC briefly mentioned in a logbook entry LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep Much of what we see here are data processing artefacts caused by the fact that the data stream abruptly ends just beyond the right edge of the fourth frame The "mast" just inside the right edge is genuine noise though indicating that one of LIGO Livingston's feedback control loops was saturating https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3284783/ Yes this is a fairly typical Power Line glitch as they look like nowadays The extra noise below Hz in these cases is a byproduct "downconversion" as the engineers call it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384528/ Agreed Scattered Light has changed a lot in appearance over the years The large loud multi arch form is no longer happening now the cause for that kind was found in late and fixed in January before the end of O The Field Guide entry links to a relevant article Hanford nowadays has been producing a lot of glitches similar to the present one when rendered with fine frequency resolution and coarse time resolution or looking like "wheatgrass" when rendered with opposite choices or looking "mushy" when rendered in between Scattered Light from Livingston during O has mostly been confined to very low frequencies attracting either Low Frequency Burst or Low Frequency Line classifications sometimes it's been showing up as rows of very thick round arches with little "caps" or "eyebrows" above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384535/ Here's another case where the shape of glitches has changed a whole lot over the years The Gravity Spy Machine Learning calls this a Low Frequency Burst which makes sense insofar as most of the noise is below Hz where it does less harm than at higher frequencies The cause however is Scattered Light What we see are the tops of two arches culminating below Hz at times seconds and seconds with faint hints of additional arches above each between and Hz The left arch is weaker than the central one and its top is lost under background noise leaving only parts of the rising and falling flanks near and seconds How best to classify such subjects is a wide open question at the moment Going by causes we could call them Scattered Light Going by impact on clean observing time it might make more sense to use Low Frequency Burst or Low Frequency Line to distinguish them from Scattered Light glitches that contribute much noise above Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384538/ Yes both came from the same brief "wandering line" episode at Hanford on The feature could be traced over the course of almost minutes This was probably caused by a failure of an air conditioning unit causing the temperature in an electronics room to rise causing a number of smaller fans in the power supply units of the electronics to spin up way beyond their normal rates and one of those fans making noise not only sound but also electromagnetic noise that managed to couple somehow into the ongoing observation See here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3275733?comment for some additional information https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384547/

As you keep going you'll find that the glitch mix coming out of LIGO's interferometers during the ongoing fourth observing run is quite different from anything we had seen before and different in many respects from our available glitch classes We're still in the middle of working out what's what and how to retrain one day our Machine Learning There are a lot of None Of The Above cases now Please be welcome to bring up anything that won't easily fit in or that gives rise to questions! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3385265/ Maybe wheatgrass but a blip followed by a flame joined triple blip koi fish then a low frequency blip all occurring between and https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3385769/ A tractor beam type though it looks like a human standing on their head https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3385772/ This looks very peculiar like a double "low frequency burst" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3385774/ A scythe like glitch with a loud blade and quieter handle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3385778/ Series of low frequency scattered light with banding between 14Hz and 22Hz Probably part of a series of subjects that extend beyond both sides of the time frame https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3385783/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.
