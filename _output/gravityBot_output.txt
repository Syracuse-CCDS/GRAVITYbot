User Prompt: 
    For the following text data, provide a list of primary topics of the data:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst? Maybe even a combination of glitches? maybe #scatteredlight :)
Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

    For the following text data, provide a list of primary topics of the data:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst? Maybe even a combination of glitches? maybe #scatteredlight :)
Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with

- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

User Prompt: 
    For the following text data, provide a list of primary topics of the data:
     Is this a scattered light glitch or a low frequency burst? Maybe even a combination of glitches? maybe #scatteredlight :)
Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:
[![50324234 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/2245b48e-6820-4d1e-b0fd-0d6ad3af94a3.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50324234)

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

Seems like to me that it is low frequency scattered light.
I think it was after modifications were made to reduce vibrations at that time.

 What are the units for the right hand vertical axis Hi,
There's a 'repeating blip' class. What about the 'repeating koi fish' class? There are repeating koi fishes.  

 What is this? It looks like it could be a 'Helix' or 'Chirp'.  That's right, sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals... and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips.

There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time, so the central shape, when it's recognizable, takes precedence - and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud.

Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of [LIGO fireballs](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/917436), and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason. These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members. Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else... There is much about all these glitches that isn't well understood yet.

You're very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes, revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience, and present them in Talk > [Collections](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729)!

For some inspiration, @mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now:
- [Hanford Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/hanford-fireballish-with-koi)
- [Livingston Fireballish with koi](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/livingston-fireballish-with-koi)

to be compared with
- [H Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/h-fireballish-no-koi)
- [L Fireballish no koi](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/mitchnanny/l-fireballish-no-koi)

while I've been a fan of some of the more regular arrangements:
- [loud blip group symmetric with Koi - grand organ](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/loud-blip-group-symmetric-with-koi-grand-organ) Yes, subjects like this one, where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top, are a nuisance - I'm never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips (subclass blip) or with the Blip subclass varnish run ("flowing down" from beyond the top edge).

At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation, but that's not yet etched in stone... Nice catch, and good question!

The underlying *mechanism* is Scattered Light - for this subject, and for the whole five-minute run that @Nicm25 has extracted from the database. The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide, some like [40450189](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450189) looking more like the former, others like [40450234](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450234) looking visually halfway (the [Gravity Spy tools](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/) report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one, so - like the present subject - it had been triggered by the upper feature), and others like [40450218](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/40450218) firmly on the LFB side.

But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer. Prior to 2020-01-14 at Hanford (and prior to 2020-01-07 at Livingston), similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multi-arch Scattered Light glitches. Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses.

Other items, more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls (which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary), could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates; but for these the relative motions aren't as fast in the first place (so the stray light path length doesn't vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies); and they also don't involve the many *repeated* reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches. The end result, during days and hours of high microseism, have been thick arches - like here - that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge, sometimes with a piece of a second arch above, but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix. We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz - and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch. Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk @kenhulls, and good question!

The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary, and they aren't the same from one subject to the next. Basically they count, in steps of ten, the 256 different hues used to represent the noise-energy levels, from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 25.5 for the most energetic parts of the glitch.

These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades. We can say "brighter than level 15" instead of "brighter than, uhm, that not-very-bright-shade-of-turquoise".

In absolute terms, the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differential-arm-length measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal, and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger - somewhere around the 18th decimal, one part in a million million millions. Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms! But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible, the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale - that's the "normalizing" of the noise energy.

Thank you for contributing! Good question... it has a small bright Blip at the top, it doesn't curve upward like a Chirp would, and it does overall resemble one of the (even ghostlier and always repeating) Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford. None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice. :)

It probably originated as a compound of two or three near-simultaneous small sort-of-blips of very short duration, occupying different but overlapping frequency regions, and partially cancelling each other where they overlap, whence the two "blueberry" holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz.

Such combinations are quite rare. Over the years I've seen a few of them (and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the [Similarity Search tool](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/)). 21Hz rectangle. I classified it as 'scattered light' but it doesn't seem to quite have the fall at the end.  Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides. The second glitch looks more like the more traditional 'scattered light' glitch and probably created it's own subject. Well noted! Yes, this is Scattered Light "à la Virgo O3", and yes, these can sometimes fail to look very arch-like. I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches, one or two with only their topmost parts bright, and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture. (Incidentally, the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds, although peaking at 21.2 Hz; that's long enough to encompass also the second bright feature, so it may not have triggered another subject.)

Running this through a [similarity search](https://gravityspytools.ciera.northwestern.edu/search/) asking for 10 results from Virgo, era O3, produces some less extreme examples for comparison. Two well-developed little arches in quick succession, probably coming from different corners of the interferometer:
[![51214366 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/0221a1b6-107d-46ee-859e-ea53521099e6.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51214366)

Another one where only the topmost parts of the two arches (the "keystones" or "capstones" if you wish) are bright:
[![50347545 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/e141f648-f716-437b-bc14-5e251d330f16.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/50347545)

(Rows of) arches from different corners often appear at slightly different frequencies, since the ground motion at Virgo's West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other:
[![51184337 frame 4](https://thumbnails.zooniverse.org/300x370/panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/3b693347-b6c9-4d6f-99e4-22274071545a.png)](/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/subjects/51184337)

And the flanks of an arch may sometimes be brighter than the top, and may overlap with other features, causing an additional brightening:

Putting all these possibilities together, we may arrive at cases like the present subject. :)

\- On a few rare occasions during O3, Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches (spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way), but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGO's (though not as rapid as LIGO's Crowns). Their whistle control, which happens to be at close frequency, causes optical resonance as glitches.

 The low-frequency features in the present subject are a low-Q rendering of Scattered Light (as corroborated by the several eminently recognizable high-Q renderings in this list of surrounding subjects - thanks @Nicm25!).

The two kinds of glitches are not causally related. This is the second one of these that I get. I guess there's not a hashtag for these blips yet? @Nicm25 I don't recognize it as scattered light. Have you seen more scattered light like this one? Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q. #blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2, 3 and 4. This seems like it could be a Koi and something else. No, there's no name yet for such borderline cases in particular.

Long ago, in a galaxy far away... uhm... well, long ago \@christingle (who is no longer active on Zooniverse) had been using #viscousdrop on some of these things that we've more recently been talking about as "top-attached blips" or "subclass varnish run". However, use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects. The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff. Thus I'm rather reluctant about continuing to use it now.

Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties, and of particular traits. (And they aren't so easy to mis-spell. :)) *And* they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools - whereas hashtags can't be. So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips? :) #bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips. 
Yes to start a new collection, but why the word "borderline" and not just "varnish run blip"? #fireball-koi  #fireball-koi  Oh, I'm sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case you've met. (I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run.)

Actually, *both* approaches may be useful - a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass, and a separate collection for fringe cases.

I haven't started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter, because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already (plus more yet on two test accounts). So there's a gap worth filling with a fringe collection, if you are so inclined; but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful. #bliplet at 49hz So "top-attached-blips" are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz.
And subjects like the one here are, where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish, should belong to a class "borderline varnish run blip" and I
will create such collection with this subject.

 Messy whistle in frame 1 and a  combination of whistle and drizzle in frames 3 and 4. #bliplet at 32hz #boudin Possible chirp at 0.35 483 Hz #fireball-koi  #coronet #bliplet at 40 Hz #trumpetfish-middle-band

repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk762917436 and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these glitches that isnt well understood yet Youre very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now Hanford Fireballish with

regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organprojectszooniversegravityspycollectionszngabitantloudblipgroupsymmetricwithkoigrandorgan Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicm25 has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450189 looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450234 looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450218 firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame

often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other

arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening 50324234 frame

together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency

recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm25 The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nicm25 I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy

repeating koi fish class There are repeating koi fishes  What is this It looks like it could be a Helix or Chirp  Thats right sometimes our Koi Fish arrive in whole shoals and there are also mixed groups where a central Koi Fish is surrounded by a number of Blips There is no dedicated class for such groups at the present time so the central shape when its recognizable takes precedence and the most extensive groups may qualify for Extremely Loud Some of these groupings may belong to a proposed class of LIGO fireballsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk762917436 and could be classified as None Of The Above for that reason These groups have quite closely but irregularly spaced members Groups with more regular spacing may turn out one day to be yet something else There is much about all these glitches that isnt well understood yet Youre very welcome to start collections of any variants that catch your eyes revisit and review them after a while in the light of further examples and experience and present them in Talk > Collectionsprojectszooniversegravityspytalk729 For some inspiration mitchnanny has been pursuing the fireball angle for a while now Hanford Fireballish with

regular arrangements loud blip group symmetric with Koi grand organprojectszooniversegravityspycollectionszngabitantloudblipgroupsymmetricwithkoigrandorgan Yes subjects like this one where the bright part stops below 2048 Hz but a faint extension reaches up all the way to the top are a nuisance Im never quite sure whether to put them with the ordinary Blips subclass blip or with the Blip subclass varnish run flowing down from beyond the top edge At the moment I lean more towards the latter interpretation but thats not yet etched in stone Nice catch and good question The underlying mechanism is Scattered Light for this subject and for the whole fiveminute run that Nicm25 has extracted from the database The glitches fall somewhere between the Scattered Light and Low Frequency Burst classes as described in the Field Guide some like 40450189projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450189 looking more like the former others like 40450234projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450234 looking visually halfway the Gravity Spy toolshttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedu report a peak frequency of 25Hz for that one so like the present subject it had been triggered by the upper feature and others like 40450218projectszooniversegravityspytalksubjects40450218 firmly on the LFB side But they really all originated in the same manner and in the same parts of the interferometer Prior to 20200114 at Hanford and prior to 20200107 at Livingston similar amounts of ground vibrations would have produced the familiar loud multiarch Scattered Light glitches Those were fixed on the indicated dates by a software tweak which suppressed most of the motions of the reflecting items relative to the nearby test masses Other items more rigidly attached to the vacuum chamber walls which move along with the ground while the test masses remain stationary could still catch and reflect some stray light after these dates but for these the relative motions arent as fast in the first place so the stray light path length doesnt vary so fast and the resulting noise tends to stay at lower frequencies and they also dont involve the many repeated reflections which had been causing all those parallel arches The end result during days and hours of high microseism have been thick arches like here that rarely rise far above the 10 Hz bottom edge sometimes with a piece of a second arch above but no longer whole lots of parallel slender arches culminating above 32 Hz as there had been before the fix We call it an LFB when we can see only a blob below 16 Hz and only the context of the surrounding subjects makes it clear that the blob really is the top of a very low frequency arch Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk kenhulls and good question The units for the normalized energy are arbitrary and they arent the same from one subject to the next Basically they count in steps of ten the 256 different hues used to represent the noiseenergy levels from dark violet at 0 for the faintest background level to bright yellow at 255 for the most energetic parts of the glitch These numbers are there mainly so that we can talk about the more intense and less intense parts of a glitch without having to give names to all the intermediate color shades We can say brighter than level 15 instead of brighter than uhm that notverybrightshadeofturquoise In absolute terms the faintest glitches we get to see correspond to variations in the differentialarmlength measurements somewhere in the 23rd decimal and the loudest glitches to variations that are some five orders of magnitude larger somewhere around the 18th decimal one part in a million million millions Thus still extremely tiny in absolute terms But in order to make all kinds of glitches well visible the fainter ones are magnified more in intensity before being mapped to our color scale thats the normalizing of the noise energy Thank you for contributing Good question it has a small bright Blip at the top it doesnt curve upward like a Chirp would and it does overall resemble one of the even ghostlier and always repeating Helix glitches from Livingston but comes from Hanford None Of The Above is perhaps the safest choice It probably originated as a compound of two or three nearsimultaneous small sortofblips of very short duration occupying different but overlapping frequency regions and partially cancelling each other where they overlap whence the two blueberry holes in the resulting shape around 40 and around 80 Hz Such combinations are quite rare Over the years Ive seen a few of them and more of them recently as I started looking for additional examples with the help of the Similarity Search toolhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch 21Hz rectangle I classified it as scattered light but it doesnt seem to quite have the fall at the end Looks almost X shaped with rise and fall off both sides The second glitch looks more like the more traditional scattered light glitch and probably created its own subject Well noted Yes this is Scattered Light la Virgo O3 and yes these can sometimes fail to look very archlike I would suspect that the present subject has arisen as a superposition of three or four separate little arches one or two with only their topmost parts bright and one or two with only their flanks contributing to the picture Incidentally the metadata report broadband excess noise all the way up to 8 kHz for more than 2 seconds although peaking at 212 Hz thats long enough to encompass also the second bright feature so it may not have triggered another subject Running this through a similarity searchhttpsgravityspytoolscieranorthwesternedusearch asking for 10 results from Virgo era O3 produces some less extreme examples for comparison Two welldeveloped little arches in quick succession probably coming from different corners of the interferometer 51214366 frame

often appear at slightly different frequencies since the ground motion at Virgos West End and North End and Central buildings will always be slightly different and rarely in step with each other

arch may sometimes be brighter than the top and may overlap with other features causing an additional brightening 50324234 frame

together we may arrive at cases like the present subject On a few rare occasions during O3 Virgo has also produced very wide slow arches spanning more than 4 seconds and bright all the way but most of the time Virgo O3 Scattered Light consists of narrower arches in more rapid succession than LIGOs though not as rapid as LIGOs Crowns Their whistle control which happens to be at close frequency

recognizable highQ renderings in this list of surrounding subjects thanks Nicm25 The two kinds of glitches are not causally related This is the second one of these that I get I guess theres not a hashtag for these blips yet Nicm25 I dont recognize it as scattered light Have you seen more scattered light like this one Thank you for letting me know about the scattered light at low Q blip plus what looks like crowns at Q5 in frames 2 3 and 4 This seems like it could be a Koi and something else No theres no name yet for such borderline cases in particular Long ago in a galaxy far away uhm well long ago christingle who is no longer active on Zooniverse had been using viscousdrop on some of these things that weve more recently been talking about as topattached blips or subclass varnish run However use of this tag has not been limited to these subjects The same tag has also got applied to some Virgo O2a fireballs and to some other stuff Thus Im rather reluctant about continuing to use it now Collections are a more robust way of keeping track of subclasses and varieties and of particular traits And they arent so easy to misspell And they can be inspected as a whole with the Gravity Spy tools whereas hashtags cant be So why not start a collection of borderline varnish run Blips  bliplet at 40hz Thanks for the history of these blips Yes to start a new collection but why the word borderline and not just varnish run blip fireballkoi  fireballkoi  Oh Im sorry I may have misunderstood you I had thought you were saying that this subject was only the second such borderline case youve met I think you have already brought up more than two LIGO subjects in Talk that I would be inclined to call Blips of subclass varnish run Actually both approaches may be useful a collection of subjects that extend brightly all the way to the top and definitely belong to this subclass and a separate collection for fringe cases I havent started a separate borderline collection myself for the latter because I am juggling more than three hundred collections already plus more yet on two test accounts So theres a gap worth filling with a fringe collection if you are so inclined but a bulk collection capturing the core population of the subclass will of course also come in useful bliplet at 49hz So topattachedblips are blips that are yellow all the way to the 2048 Hz And subjects like the one here are where the top extends to 2048 Hz but is blue or bluish should belong to a class borderline varnish run blip and I will create such collection with this subject  Messy

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362094/ The Machine Learning part of Gravity Spy thinks of this and similar subjects as Low Frequency Lines based on how it had been trained in the past But they aren't "lines" in the spectral line sense tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk They are high Q renderings of very low frequency Scattered Light arches cut off below either by the Hz bottom edge or already at Hz by always very loud background noise and cut off above by ever present loud background noise in the Hz band The background noise gets suppressed in our images At Livingston during O4a and O4b so far such very low frequency glitches account for more subjects than everything else put together which isn't quite obvious when classifying them here on Zooniverse due to the peculiar ways how subjects get distributed across the workflow levels From the point of view of how they are caused I've been leaning towards calling them Scattered Light From a practical point of view however it might make sense to keep them separate from Scattered Light glitches that rise above the Hz noise band into the Hz region where they do more harm to clean observing time than down there near the bottom edge even though it's one kind of glitch caused by one and the same kind of mechanism just a difference in how fast the reflecting item was moving at the time Our current classification scheme doesn't capture these aspects very well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3361831/ NOTA unknown 60Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362310/ "NotNoGlitch" There had to be noise at least a factor of above the background in order to trigger a Gravity Spy subject and extracting these data for the present S with the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search we find an SNR of peak frequency Hz and duration of seconds as recorded by the glitch detection software Omicron So this is really going to be very low frequency Scattered Light but the Hz bottom edge of our images is dark purple Now that is a hint that something even louder must have been happening either before or usually afterwards so it's worth checking also the approximate time after UTC from the hours wide rectangle centered on it as displayed by a Sim Search asking for a single result and then heading to the logbook tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG and the status summary pages tab https gwosc org detector status The status page for tab https gwosc org detector status day includes a plot of the observing segments on that date !

    Now consider Talk Dataset 2:
     Extremely loud but interesting due to the loud high frequency static https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ A ripple comb with some interesting shapes that are louder than the rest including the squashed at the and the paired lines between and https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365862/ Well observed and an interesting example ! Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367332/ It looks like repeating blips going into a koi fish though the blips might be a wheatgrass glitch instead given they seem to be joined together Also the parentheses around the koi fish are interesting https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/ Could be a really wide ripple comb or a series of subtle scattered light over a wide frequency band that seems to be descending in frequency along the leading edge https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/ is this still koi fish? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/ Looks like a ripple comb coming to a end louder than the earlier part of the comb shown https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/ Scattered Light and more Scattered Light these are two successive stacks of parallel arches each with the top of a lower arch around Hz and a "cap" or "eyebrow" arch above it around Hz Usually such stacks are caused by the same stray light path being traversed more than once With each additional roundtrip the rate of change of the total path length traversed expressed as number of laser wavelengths per second and thus giving the frequency at which the noise will show up increases by a similar amount https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367332/ Good question I'm not sure what to make of this It's either a single group or "flock" lasting about seconds and ending with a smallish Koi Fish or a flock of blips lasting only seconds centered around time seconds followed by a separate smallish Koi Fish by coincidence https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/ A bit of a head scratcher thinking The central Koi Fish may be part of the flock of blips that starts around time seconds or else it might be an independent glitch appearing next to it by sheer coincidence Either way the parentheses are part of the Koi's "fins" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/ Another nice example from this lot tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Plus a little stack of scattered light archlets around time seconds unusually neatly shaped as Hanford O scattered light goes which often looks rather messier Sometimes it's much easier to assign a glitch to a population taking into account when it had happened and what else had been happening around the same time and then the entire population to a proposed class than to classify each individual subject separately especially when as in this case the individual examples show quite a lot of variability https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/ I would file this under moderately messy Scattered Light Hanford O style By the time late November the present S got recorded the medium frequency ripple comb glitches that had been common from mid July onwards had become rare again at Hanford For comparison here's a late MF ripple S from October fourth frames of the two subjects side by side both rendered at Q ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location f 733d 42da 8b 097033091dc png ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 7f a c a 4ff c 20354 f dd png The differences can be subtle The ripples tend ed to last much longer than four seconds at a time we usually see only pieces of them Hanford O Scattered Light features at typically slightly lower frequencies usually form shorter groups each group lasting about seconds Only on a few exceptional days did they continue beyond both the left and right edges The Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search also helps here The MF ripples almost always have peak frequencies near or or or Hz Scattered Light glitches mostly live at somewhat lower frequencies and once they manage to rise above the Hz background noise band they do not prefer any particular narrow frequency bands since the frequencies at which they show up are dictated by how fast the reflecting item is moving at any given moment which varies on a continuous scale https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/

    - 1400 Ripple 
    - 70 Hz Line 
    - Air Compressor (50 Hz)
    - Blip

    - Tomte 
    - Uncategorized_Glitches 
    - Violin Mode Harmonic 
    - Wandering Line 
    - Whistle 

    Below are a list of things I would like an answer for. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

This class is suggested due to the observed patterns that resemble a grouping or cluster of similar glitch shapes, termed "blips," which seem to occur in a sequence or batch. This collective appearance suggests a distinctive class that might warrant separate categorization from individual blips due to its nature and the possible underlying causes that lead to such clustered appearances.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n**Answer 2: Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes**\n\nIn Talk Dataset 2, there is a noticeable questioning regarding the classification adequacy of certain glitches. For instance, there\'s a discussion about whether certain observed phenomena should be classified as "wheat grass" or another class due to the appearance of a glitch that looks like a koi fish made of smaller koi fish. This reflects a broader concern about whether existing classifications comprehensively cover the spectrum of observed glitches or if they need refinement to accommodate new observations.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/\n\n**Answer 3: Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects**\n\nIn Talk Dataset 2, questions arise about the nature of some glitches and their classification. For instance, there\'s a query whether a particular pattern forms part of a "flock of blips" or if it stands as an independent glitch. This questioning goes deeper into understanding the categorization rules and characteristics that define different glitch classes, reflecting an ongoing learning process about the granularity and distinctions between different types of glitches.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n**Answer 4: Hypotheses About Glitch Origins**\n\nTalk Dataset 2 contains specific hypotheses concerning the origins of glitches. Several discussions hypothesize environmental factors impacting the sensors, such as external vibrations from seismic activity potentially causing locklosses and influencing the glitches observed. For instance, an earthquake near Tonga discussed might have caused specific glitches due to seismic waves influencing the detector.\n\n- URL related to response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3362604/\n\n**Answer 5: Questions Concerning Connections to Sensors or Channels**\n\nThere\'s a discussion in Talk Dataset 2 about whether the observed glitches, specifically the categories and shapes like "scattered light," are linked to particular sensors or channels, especially when they resemble shapes or patterns known to be caused by specific sensor actions or malfunctions. This includes wondering about the impact of sensor changes and configurations, like the shift from ETMY to ETMX, which could influence the types and appearances of glitches observed.\n\n- URL related to response: httpsid: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1720383892, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_486730399b', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=642, prompt_tokens=5281, total_tokens=5923))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    Below are a list of things I would like an answer for. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

     Extremely loud but interesting due to the loud high frequency static https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ A ripple comb with some interesting shapes that are louder than the rest including the squashed at the and the paired lines between and https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365862/ Well observed and an interesting example ! Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    Below are a list of things I would like an answer for. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

They describe this as a group or "flock" lasting about 10 seconds and ending with a smallish Koi Fish, or as a separate event consisting of a flock of blips lasting only 4 seconds. This description suggests a distinct pattern or clustering of blips, differentiating it from other known classes.\n   - URLs: \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - Citizen scientists express concerns about the general categorization and the effectiveness of the machine learning (ML) in accurately capturing the essence of certain glitches. They discuss the limitations of ML classifications in dealing with new or nuanced types of glitches. They suggest that some glitches might span multiple classifications or not fit neatly into existing ones based on their observed characteristics and behaviors.\n   - URLs:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are emerging questions about whether certain observed patterns are independent glitches or part of a larger, connected event. For example, discussions around whether a central Koi Fish is part of a flock of blips or an independent glitch signify an inquiry into the connectivity and interaction of different glitch types.\n   - URLs:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Citizen scientists hypothesize that the visible frequency band of glitches might be influenced by environmental conditions like seismic activities or operational changes in the interferometers. For instance, they correlate a lockloss event and subsequent glitches with an earthquake in Mexico, analyzing how external seismic activities could induce specific glitches.\n   - Another hypothesis revolves around operational adjustments, such as changes in actuation at the Livingston observatory, potentially causing a regular pattern of glitches seen as "flock of blips."\n   - URLs:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Connection of Glitches to Specific Sensors or Channels:**\n   - Discussions in Talk Dataset 2 involve examining the relationship between glitches and specific operational changes or sensor states at observatories.

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class?

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both  sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations?

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. 

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation?

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe?

One notable mention is a glitch described as resembling "a koi fish made of koi fish," which suggests a recursive or self-similar structure in the glitch appearance. This description indicates an observed pattern that combines known glitch types into a potentially new, composite form. Similarly, discussions around "cuneiform type loud glitch" and "extremely wide ripple comb" suggest observations of unique spectral patterns which are not clearly classified under existing categories. These discussions showcase the citizen scientists\' active engagement in refining glitch classification based on emergent data.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367332/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a noticeable discussion about the uncertainty in categorizing certain glitches, such as whether a specific pattern should be classified as "low frequency blip" or "wheat grass." This indicates ongoing challenges and potential confusion in applying existing glitch classes accurately to observed data. The discussion suggests that existing classifications might not fully encompass the variability or nuances of observed glitch patterns, leading to uncertainty among citizen scientists.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions on Technical Aspects and Classifications:**\n   - Talk Dataset 2 includes queries about the detailed structures within observed glitches. For instance, questions about whether certain features in a glitch are part of a larger group or independent phenomena highlight a deeper dive into understanding the intricate details of glitch morphology. Such questions reflect a growing sophistication in the citizen scientists\' approach to data analysis, focusing on the interrelations and individual characteristics of glitch components.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367900/\n\n4. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Participants in Talk Dataset 2 hypothesize about the environmental and operational context of glitches. For instance, links between specific glitches and external events like earthquakes are explored, suggesting a direct correlation between environmental disturbances and glitch occurrences. This analysis is grounded in real-time events affecting the sensor\'s operational environment, thereby providing a contextual understanding of glitch origins.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Questions and Thoughts in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Dataset 2, there is a discussion about the potential impact of changes in sensor configurations on the observation of glitches. For example, changes in the DARM ESD actuation are speculated to influence the visibility and characteristics of glitches. This illustrates the participants\' engagement with understanding how specific technical adjustments in LIGO\'s sensor setup might affect data acquisition and glitch characteristics.\n   - **Relevant URLs:**\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3219652/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367902/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1720393647, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_486730399b', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=837, prompt_tokens=5300, total_tokens=6137))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Even though the interferometer survived the very loud glitch centered on time seconds for a little bit longer there was a lockloss shortly afterwards at 12T UTC caused by an earthquake in Mexico and by sheer bad luck this happened a mere four minutes after LLO had recovered from the previous lockloss and resumed observing the longer story is told in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep The high frequency noise band which shows up in many lockloss subjects from Livingston is a data processing artefact caused by the data stream from which the image has been created stopping abruptly a few seconds beyond the right edge The processing software needs a sufficient number of seconds of valid data on either side of each subject to do its job fully If not enough is available it will be unable to deal correctly with either very low frequencies or very high frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3365742/ whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366275/ This comes from just before the lockloss at 01T UTC LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3054533/ Identified as a low frequency blip though looking at frame it might be a quiet wheat grass with one very loud stalk https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3366940/ This looks like a koi fish made of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367246/ Cuneiform type loud glitch in what might be a quieter wheatgrass https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3367254/ a low frequency line with a scattered light?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The description focuses on the grouped, transient nature of these glitches, suggesting a collective rather than isolated appearance in the spectrogram data. The term emphasizes the visual and possibly dynamic character of these glitches as a coherent group.\n   - **"Ripple Comb"**: This new class is proposed to describe glitches characterized by repetitive, wave-like patterns that resemble the teeth of a comb. This glitch class emphasizes the structured, periodic nature of the disturbance, potentially indicative of a repetitive or oscillatory underlying cause.\n   - URLs influencing response: \n     - Flock of Blips: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n     - Ripple Comb: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368209/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is an ongoing discussion about the appropriateness of classifying certain glitches under existing categories like "Scattered Light" and "Koi Fish". Participants express uncertainties about whether these classifications accurately capture the characteristics of the glitches observed. For example, they debate if a pattern should be classified as "Koi Fish" or merely a variation of "Wheat Grass", suggesting a need for clearer or more distinct classification criteria.\n   - URLs influencing response: \n     - Concerns on Scattered Light and Koi Fish classifications: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects**\n   - Participants in Talk Dataset 2 raise questions about the consistency of glitch appearances and their classifications. For instance, they discuss the appearance of glitches resembling "Koi Fish" and whether these should be considered as an independent class or as a variant of another class due to their similar features to other glitches.\n   - There is curiosity about the methodological aspects of glitch classification, such as how machine learning models are trained to recognize and categorize glitches, and whether these models are sufficiently adaptable to newly observed glitch types.\n   - URLs influencing response:\n     - Questions on glitch classification consistency and methodology: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3368015/\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2**\n   - One hypothesis discussed concerns the environmental impact on glitch occurrences, specifically how natural events like earthquakes can cause significant disruptions in sensor readings, leading to identifiable glitches in the data.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

That one is currently a bit of a junkyard due to an unfortunate combination of reasons and it currently tends to be somewhat starved of submissions too These transients near Hz belong here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk This proposed glitch class was never turned into an official classification option These glitches had happened only during three consecutive days to at Hanford and the cause had already been fixed by the time the corresponding subjects were uploaded to Zooniverse a few days later The researches had therefore intended to retire all of the roughly subjects involved but this didn't turn out to be feasible So we still keep encountering them in level to be classified like much else in this level as None Of The Above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3380401/ Not unless they should occur again They clearly form a very distinct population but the minimum required for a formal glitch class proposal would be distinct subjects and we've seen and one of our veterans has collected tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections deleteduser 1795hz exactly of them Their cause is unknown they all come from Hanford from one week in late October See also this entry tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2961842?comment in the Early Alerts thread Around that time there were recurrent issues with uploading subjects simultaneously to Zooniverse and to the Gravity Spy tools tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu resulting in many partially failed uploads and many retries By the time this was sorted out each of these glitches hat got uploaded either five or six times to Zooniverse under different subject numbers so now there are more than subjects for them altogether It has not proved practical to eliminate the duplicates from the active subjects in the level workflow the present subject is one of them All we can do for now is classify all of them as None Of The Above and I've kept indicating the duplicates by putting them into a marker collection Those with subject numbers 9287xxxx 9289xxxx 9302xxxx 9327xxxx 9343xxxx are the extraneous ones where the uploads didn't fully succeed The good ones those which have become visible to the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search have 9636xxxx numbers https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3380403/ You will have noticed that the glitch mix that's been coming out of Advanced LIGO's fourth observing run O now into its second half O4b is rather different from anything we've ever seen before Blips and Koi Fish have remained recognizable with minor changes due to reduced stationary background noise Extremely Loud is still with us Violin Mode Harmonics have been seen a few times though most subjects caused by rung up violin modes look completely bland and can be recognized only by their peak frequencies in the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search combined with relevant logbook entries for the days in question On one occasion in January we've had a Wandering Line tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3275733?comment that can be traced along successive subjects for about minutes Gone we hope! are Whistles Gone are the splendid large multi arch Scattered Light subjects that were common during earlier runs the cause for them had been pinpointed in late and clever fixes applied in January before the end of O got rid of them The Field Guide Entry for Scattered Light links to a relevant paper Gone are Crowns Scattered Light is still causing the vast majority of glitches around but most of them now show up at very low frequencies and end up being classified as either Low Frequency Lines or Low Frequency Burst whereas genuine Low Frequency Lines tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk are rare and don't look like much see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and genuine Low Frequency Bursts even rarer The Line absent during O may have returned or else some other cause is producing close lookalikes And all sorts of completely new things have been showing up in moderate numbers B Do keep an eye on the New Glitch Classes LIGO tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk board https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3380401/

     Well the Machine Learning has never yet been trained for these it was left to guess within the limits of its limited "imagination" But to be fair back in when the subjects from the earlier event were first showing up humans were equally mystified tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 415698?comment by them https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3370677/ After running cascaded similarity searches until my queue was exhausted I'm looking at so far subjects tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h b bike chain or hz from this heating episode I'm not sure about their chronological order in part because I can't limit the searches to O4b only but let me point out a few series of successively overlapping subjects before UTC ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 3345c 06de 4 c ec 84041 b png tab ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 28 cd adfa 48fb 9 a a png tab ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 2530 a f bec bf b png tab before ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location cae c 40c dd png tab ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location a 469d 893a 29 fd png tab around ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location b 4bdb 417d a f a png tab ! framr https thumbnails zooniverse org 220x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location dfe 25fd 91ea 962 bd png tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3129990/ Ah apologies to Machine Learning https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3370677/ Blip with a leading whistle type glitch leading into it centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383003/ Boot like low frequency blip centered at though it looks like it might be a part of a wheat grass Another glitch centered at which might have its own subject https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383006/ Perhaps an abnormally quiet lead up to lock loss starting at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383007/ Looks like a glimmering of koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383011/ Three scattered light glitches with the suppressed band between 26Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383015/ A glimmering of koi fish or extremely loud https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3383017/ Found this glitch similar to the Koi Fish glitch but in groups https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384386/ The glitch can look like it is neither a Blip nor Whistle but as time progresses it will narrow into a W shape classifying it as a Whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/224113/ It may look abnormal at first but as time progresses toward the next frames the glitch takes the form of a "W " classifying it as a whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/178209/ It takes the form of a "W" as time progresses in the next frames making it a whistle glitch with a very low normalized energy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/104145/ Although I believed it to be none of the forms I decided to finalize the classification of a koi fish due to the fact that it fits the criteria of a blip with fins wings even though the one on the right is abnormally large with higher normalized energy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/104202/ This one was tricky due to the fact that there is an abnormally large "fin" to the left with very high normalized energy but I would still classify it as a koi fish due to it meeting the criteria of being a Blip with fins wings even though one has significantly more normalized energy levels than the other https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384512/ Would there be such thing as a power line with a frequency below 60Hz? If that is possible for a glitch then I would classify it as that if not then it is possibly none of the mentioned glitch formats https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384515/ This looks like a 60Hz power line at a glance of the main glitch but it has high normalized energy in the frequencies below it as well I classified it as a power line but it could also be none of the above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384517/ I thought it was a blip at first but if you observe around the areas of the main glitch you can probably make out fins wings due to the faint normalized energy in those areas classifying it as a koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3302220/ I thought that there was no glitch at first but if you check the frames with the different time intervals you will notice the dots in the frequencies above Hz all in a vertical arrangement columns classifying it as a Violin Mode Harmonic https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/2327400/ This comment has been deleted https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/1160323/ It looks like a koi fish due to the fact that it meets the criteria of a sharp blip with fins wings If you look closely you can see the blip shape at time and the wings on the left and right sides even though they look abnormal due to the high normalized energy and weird shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/1160323/ Very very narrow "V " but it still classifies as a whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/122657/ This one is crazy it looks like there is barely any transition of normalized energy levels at around the Hz frequency like it has super high contrast To add on the fact of the weird spots at the frequencies above make this even more abnormal https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3284783/ I've seen lots of these before they always look like a power line with high normalized energy below the Hz frequency would these need new classification? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384528/ It is a scattered light because there is a faint glitch with high normalized energy at around frequency Hz and a very thick one at around frequency Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384535/ Double blip or a very very faint Koi fish? I could be wrong but I somewhat see the fins wings of the koi fish on the sides of the main blip at time 0s even though the one on the left has high normalized energy and the other has very very low normalized energy then again I could be wrong https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384536/ This is VERY similar to a power line but at very low frequency compared to the usual Hz it could classify as a power line or none of the above for me https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384538/ This looks like a very concentrated blip due to its high contrast with the normalized energy surrounding it with barely any transition from high to low https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3165364/ This may look like a very very low frequency power line but it is actually an energy burst when you move onto the more zoomed out frames with greater time intervals https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384541/ If you notice the low normalized energy line at around the frequency of Hz it may look like a high frequency line but I believe that it may be a different classification I can also see it kind of looking like a horizontal version of a violin mode harmonic but I could be wrong https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3280175/ This looks like a very long wide low frequency burst with other high normalized energy glitches in the surrounding area https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384544/ This somewhat looks like a lower frequency version of a power line https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384545/ This one looks super similar to Subject a high frequency glitch with long duration adn very low normalized energy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384547/ Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk JadenNino and thank you for contributing! Correct this is a Whistle from the first observing run in We've still had a number of Whistle glitches until the third observing run O but none yet during the ongoing fourth O O4b It's not necessary to annotate each and every subject we have far too many but please be welcome to bring up anything that's unusual or specially noteworthy or giving rise to questions! Over the years and after many upgrades to the observatories the glitch mix has changed a lot Some old glitch classes are no longer happening others have changed in appearance and completely new things are appearing now that still need investigating You'll meet quite a lot of None Of The Above as you advance through the workflows One more remark Time advances from left to right in each of our subject images The animation merely zooms out along the time axis from half a second shown in the first frame to showing four seconds' worth in the fourth frame https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/178209/ Yes this doesn't really want to fit into the available classes I would tend to calling it None Of The Above Glitches like this close irregularly spaced groups of blip like "glitchlets" with a well defined beginning and end have been happening for years but have never been very common so there isn't even a proposed glitch class yet for them They've been nicknamed flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384512/ Well noted Indeed it's not a Power Line It's quite close to Hz the noise distribution peaked at Hz It's part of a population of medium frequency glitches that first showed up in larger numbers at Hanford in mid July and since then they've gradually become rare again We have a pending glitch class proposal tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk for them The Machine Learning part of Gravity Spy did mistake this for a Power Line with high confidence At some point it will need to be retrained to recognize all the new sorts of glitches from recent years but a lot of work is still needed in this direction it will need to be done in such a way that the LIGO engineers afterwards will still be able to compare recent Machine Learning classifications to older ones from past years https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384515/ Good points! I had run into this subject almost a year ago scratched my head for a bit and settled on NOTA but now that I look at it again it could be a fringe case of a Power Line possibly together with some unrelated noise There's a little dent in it at time seconds and a little "eye" at time seconds which could correspond to the moments when some Hz noise started and ended and when the filtering that suppresses the ever present steady Hz noise from the grid mains power momentarily changed between overcompensating and undercompensating it and back https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384517/ There are two things going on here The central glitch is somewhere on the border between a rather loud Blip a Koi Fish for the faint "fins" around Hz and Extremely Loud for the more obvious "lighthouse" artefacts around Hz there are much louder examples which share these traits So it's not a clear cut classification Your vote is as good as mine here The surrounding low frequency "wheatgrass" as it has been nicknamed is unrelated a chance near coincidence and is actually caused by scattered light it's hard to recognize here due to the rendering choices very fine time resolution to bring out the central glitch to best effect at the expense of very coarse frequency resolution https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3302220/ These can be classified as Extremely Loud This subject was recorded a couple of seconds before a lockloss tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk on at UTC briefly mentioned in a logbook entry LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep Much of what we see here are data processing artefacts caused by the fact that the data stream abruptly ends just beyond the right edge of the fourth frame The "mast" just inside the right edge is genuine noise though indicating that one of LIGO Livingston's feedback control loops was saturating https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3284783/ Yes this is a fairly typical Power Line glitch as they look like nowadays The extra noise below Hz in these cases is a byproduct "downconversion" as the engineers call it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384528/ Agreed Scattered Light has changed a lot in appearance over the years The large loud multi arch form is no longer happening now the cause for that kind was found in late and fixed in January before the end of O The Field Guide entry links to a relevant article Hanford nowadays has been producing a lot of glitches similar to the present one when rendered with fine frequency resolution and coarse time resolution or looking like "wheatgrass" when rendered with opposite choices or looking "mushy" when rendered in between Scattered Light from Livingston during O has mostly been confined to very low frequencies attracting either Low Frequency Burst or Low Frequency Line classifications sometimes it's been showing up as rows of very thick round arches with little "caps" or "eyebrows" above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384535/ Here's another case where the shape of glitches has changed a whole lot over the years The Gravity Spy Machine Learning calls this a Low Frequency Burst which makes sense insofar as most of the noise is below Hz where it does less harm than at higher frequencies The cause however is Scattered Light What we see are the tops of two arches culminating below Hz at times seconds and seconds with faint hints of additional arches above each between and Hz The left arch is weaker than the central one and its top is lost under background noise leaving only parts of the rising and falling flanks near and seconds How best to classify such subjects is a wide open question at the moment Going by causes we could call them Scattered Light Going by impact on clean observing time it might make more sense to use Low Frequency Burst or Low Frequency Line to distinguish them from Scattered Light glitches that contribute much noise above Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384538/ Yes both came from the same brief "wandering line" episode at Hanford on The feature could be traced over the course of almost minutes This was probably caused by a failure of an air conditioning unit causing the temperature in an electronics room to rise causing a number of smaller fans in the power supply units of the electronics to spin up way beyond their normal rates and one of those fans making noise not only sound but also electromagnetic noise that managed to couple somehow into the ongoing observation See here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3275733?comment for some additional information https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3384547/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.
    
GRAVITYBOT RESPONSE:
ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9p4pgaZw4vwZvUa6JQcLMNH5gkvWY', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='### Novel Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2\n\n1. **Sparse Flock** - In Talk Dataset 2, a new glitch class suggested is the "Sparse Flock." This classification describes glitches that appear as a congregation of several blip-like glitches closely resembling a flock but more spaced out. These are characterized by their distribution and density, which are less clustered than traditional flock glitches. The identification of this new class helps in categorizing glitches that previously might have been misclassified or categorized broadly under another type. \n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n\n### Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n\n1. **Misclassification Issues** - In Talk Dataset 2, citizen scientists express concerns over the misclassification of glitches by the machine learning system. For instance, glitches identified as "Scattered Light" are noted to have been frequently mislabeled, prompting discussions about refining the machine learning models to better differentiate between subtypes of scattered light glitches.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3399349/\n\n### Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects\n\n1. **Questions on Classification Accuracy** - Citizen scientists in Talk Dataset 2 are inquiring about the accuracy of the machine learning classifications. They are curious about the criteria and features the algorithm uses to distinguish between similar-looking glitch classes. This reflects a deepening engagement and understanding of the technical framework behind glitch identification.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3399349/\n\n2. **Technical Details of Glitches** - There are questions regarding the specific characteristics that define each glitch class. Participants are trying to understand the nuances that categorize a glitch under classes like "Koi Fish" versus "Anglerfish," which are often visually similar but distinct in their technical attributes.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/\n\n3. **Sensor and Environmental Impacts** - Queries about how environmental factors or sensor alignments impact the frequency and appearance of certain glitches are emerging. This indicates a growing interest in the operational aspects of LIGO and how external conditions influence data quality.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3397461/\n\n### Hypotheses on Glitch Origins\n\n1. **Environmental Influences** - In Talk Dataset 2, there\'s a hypothesis that certain glitches may be influenced by environmental factors such as earthquakes or heavy equipment operations nearby. For instance, discussions about "Richland WA earthquake" and its correlation with observed glitches suggest an analytical approach to connect seismic activities with data anomalies.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396965/\n\n2. **Operational Conditions** - There\'s a hypothesis regarding the influence of operational conditions like "squeezer unlocks" affecting the data.

For instance, differences in glitch occurrences between the Hanford and Livingston sites are questioned, suggesting a localized factor in glitch appearances.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/\n\n2. **Channel Sensitivity and Noise** - Questions emerge about the sensitivity of different data channels to external noise sources and how this sensitivity might lead to the misidentification of glitches. This reflects a nuanced inquiry into the technical setup of LIGO and its susceptibility to external disturbances.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3397747/ \n\nThese points from Talk Dataset 2 highlight an evolution in the community’s engagement, from basic identification to deeper technical inquiries and hypotheses about the underlying causes of glitches.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1721960332, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_7b3074c4b0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=911, prompt_tokens=16740, total_tokens=17651))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

PI and were unable to be damped down by the GRD and we eventually lost lock Parametric Instability modes and are two which should be familiar to the SUS PI guardian so on this occasion it should have commanded good phases only these two modes are known to be prone to ringing up so fast that the available forces in the suspension actuators aren't strong enough to rein them in Unchecked these modes could cause a lockloss within half a minute or less Thus surviving them for several minutes already counts as a success of sorts Apropos of another lockloss on comments on LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep contemplate whether different PI modes were involved on different days But they don't mention the episode The comment trail alludes to an adjustment of the PR mirror suspension on Fri which could have affected the circulating light power in the arms in turn affecting the likelihood of exciting any PIs but this adjustment happened after both the and episodes So we don't have a coherent picture of the whole affair yet The range drop on looks similar to the one on The latter was associated with a rung up PI oscillation near kHz There's no clear statement about whether that was also the case during the former We have a long row of almost glitch subjects during the former we haven't yet seen any glitches that may have happened during the latter and if they produced Gravity Spy subjects then they can't have looked very similar to the present lot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3390873/ Pair of HF bursts or blip variants 93Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3189894/ Tomte blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390971/ Not no glitch ground motion coupling 41Hz Also S99974400 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390980/ Blip ssp varnish run Slightly odd shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390981/ One of these fancy blippish things entering stage right I never can remember what these are but they always remind me of the Marie Celeste at 4s anyway 03Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Flock? snr 01Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391005/ HF burst or high small thin varnish run blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391017/ I have noticed that when I add a subject to a collection and if that subject is already in the collection it is no longer flagged up in red script I deliberately sent a subject several times to one of my collections and it wasn flagged up in red script However when I looked in the collection there were no duplicates Is this something new ?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.
    
GRAVITYBOT RESPONSE:
ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9p4qM3tuikJFIRJuEtQIqias1zCHz', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='1. **New Glitch Classes in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **"Sparse Flock"** is discussed as a potential new glitch class. This classification is proposed to describe a scenario where two near simultaneous blip-like glitches appear, suggesting a group or cluster of glitches that aren\'t dense enough to be considered a typical "Flock." This classification reflects the evolving understanding of how glitches can manifest in less densely packed formations, similar to sparse bird flocks.\n   - **"Fuzzy Range"** is another proposed glitch class mentioned in Talk Dataset 2. It is described as a series of glitches that cause severe drops in sensitivity due to their occupation of middle frequencies, where LIGO sensors are usually most sensitive. The name "Fuzzy Range" was derived from the appearance and effect of these glitches on the data quality, indicating a less defined or "fuzzy" quality in the gravitational wave data.\n   - URLs contributing to the response: [Sparse Flock](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/), [Fuzzy Range](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/)\n\n2. **Concerns with Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a concern that the machine learning model used in the Gravity Spy project is misclassifying certain types of glitches. Specifically, the "Scattered Light" classification is questioned because it seems to encompass multiple distinct types of glitches that should perhaps be classified separately, such as "Cairn" and "60 Hz glitches."\n   - This misclassification underscores a persistence of concerns regarding the adequacy of existing categories to effectively distinguish between subtly different but technically distinct glitch behaviors. This points to a need for model retraining or refinement to improve classification accuracy.\n   - URLs contributing to the response: [Scattered Light Concern](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3399349/)\n\n3. **Emerging Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Questions in Talk Dataset 2 reveal a deeper dive into technical details, such as inquiries about the specific frequencies associated with certain glitches and their potential environmental or instrumental causes. For instance, discussions speculate on whether "Fuzzy Range" episodes might share a common origin with certain environmental influences or instrumental feedback mechanisms.\n   - Another question involves the exact nature and classification criteria for "Sparse Flock" glitches, indicating a desire among citizen scientists to refine their understanding and categorization skills.\n   - These questions reflect a mature engagement with the material, where citizen scientists are not just identifying but are also seeking to understand the deeper mechanics of glitch phenomena.\n   - URLs contributing to the response: [Fuzzy Range Hypothesis](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/), [Sparse Flock Query](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/)\n\n4. **Hypotheses about Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - There are detailed hypotheses regarding the "Fuzzy Range" glitches, suggesting they may be influenced by external environmental factors or internal system dynamics such as feedback loops within the LIGO detectors. The hypothesis posits that similar causes might be influencing glitch occurrences at different LIGO sites, indicating a possible systemic issue.\n   - Analytical motivations for these hypotheses include the observation of simultaneous occurrences of similar glitches across sites, temporal correlations with environmental events, and an understanding of the sensitive nature of LIGO\'s detection capabilities.\n   - URLs contributing to the response: [Fuzzy Range Hypothesis](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/)\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are emerging questions about whether glitches like the "Fuzzy Range" are specific to particular sensors or if they manifest across multiple channels. Discussions revolve around the need to compare data from different sensors to ascertain if these glitches are isolated or widespread, suggesting a more complex interaction within the detector system.\n   - These inquiries demonstrate an advanced level of technical engagement and an understanding that resolving such questions might lead to better glitch mitigation strategies or adjustments in sensor calibration.\n   - URL contributing to the response: [Sensor-Specific Inquiry](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/)', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1721960374, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_7b3074c4b0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=945, prompt_tokens=16740, total_tokens=17685))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Which one? Are we seeing a side effect of SUS PI periodically commanding new phase correction values to the fast phase locked loop that applies sine wave forces in the tens of kHz to the test mass quadrants to counteract the oscillation? If so it doesn't seem to have been very successful maybe the rung up mode wasn't the one that SUS PI thought it had to contend with A different mode resonating at a slightly different frequency might have resulted in a long row of less than helpful phase adjustments The logbook provides a little more context but raises yet more questions The Data Quality Shift summary LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep for the week around July tantalizingly notes > There is a glitch cluster just before H lost lock due to environmental factors on Thursday and Friday Okay the glitch cluster on Thursday is precisely what we're dealing with here What about Friday 05?

PI and were unable to be damped down by the GRD and we eventually lost lock Parametric Instability modes and are two which should be familiar to the SUS PI guardian so on this occasion it should have commanded good phases only these two modes are known to be prone to ringing up so fast that the available forces in the suspension actuators aren't strong enough to rein them in Unchecked these modes could cause a lockloss within half a minute or less Thus surviving them for several minutes already counts as a success of sorts Apropos of another lockloss on comments on LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep contemplate whether different PI modes were involved on different days But they don't mention the episode The comment trail alludes to an adjustment of the PR mirror suspension on Fri which could have affected the circulating light power in the arms in turn affecting the likelihood of exciting any PIs but this adjustment happened after both the and episodes So we don't have a coherent picture of the whole affair yet The range drop on looks similar to the one on The latter was associated with a rung up PI oscillation near kHz There's no clear statement about whether that was also the case during the former We have a long row of almost glitch subjects during the former we haven't yet seen any glitches that may have happened during the latter and if they produced Gravity Spy subjects then they can't have looked very similar to the present lot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3390873/ Pair of HF bursts or blip variants 93Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3189894/ Tomte blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390971/ Not no glitch ground motion coupling 41Hz Also S99974400 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390980/ Blip ssp varnish run Slightly odd shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390981/ One of these fancy blippish things entering stage right I never can remember what these are but they always remind me of the Marie Celeste at 4s anyway 03Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Flock? snr 01Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391005/ HF burst or high small thin varnish run blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391017/ I have noticed that when I add a subject to a collection and if that subject is already in the collection it is no longer flagged up in red script I deliberately sent a subject several times to one of my collections and it wasn flagged up in red script However when I looked in the collection there were no duplicates Is this something new ?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9p50KQ4HANSojRDoI2loqikiP5Keg', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='1. **New Glitch Classes in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Sparse Flock:** This is one of the proposed new glitch classes mentioned in Talk Dataset 2. It is described as a phenomenon involving a blend of two near-simultaneous blip-like glitches, suggesting a gathering (or flock) of at least four glitches, not counting fainter occurrences. The term \'sparse\' indicates that these glitches are not as densely packed as might be seen in other \'flock\' categorizations, allowing for a more scattered appearance.\n   - URLs contributing to this response:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - Concerns in Talk Dataset 2 touch upon the misclassification by the machine learning models used in the Gravity Spy project. For instance, there are comments on the \'Scattered Light\' class being too broad, encompassing glitches that should be segmented into more precise categories such as \'Traditional scattered light\', \'Cairn\', and \'Hz glitches\'. This indicates an ongoing issue with the generalization in machine learning classifications not adequately capturing the nuanced differences observed by the citizen scientists.\n   - URLs contributing to this response:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3399349/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a noticeable curiosity about the relationship between environmental factors and glitch occurrences. Questions are raised about whether conditions like the "Hz monster" or "big ugly" at different sites such as Livingston are related or if they have different origins. These inquiries reflect a deeper dive into understanding site-specific environmental interactions with sensor data.\n   - Another thread of inquiry involves the technical aspect of how specific sensor adjustments or anomalies, like the squeezer unlocks, might correlate with observed glitches. These questions indicate a growing sophistication in the citizen scientists\' approach to linking operational aspects of LIGO to data anomalies.\n   - URLs contributing to this response:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162/\n\n4. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - A hypothesis mentioned involves the \'Hz monster\' and its potential linkage to a specific environmental or operational condition at the Livingston site. The hypothesis suggests that this recurring glitch could be a result of particular environmental influences or a malfunction in an operational subsystem like the squeezer. The analytical motivation stems from observing consistent patterns associated with these glitches during specific operational conditions or environmental setups.\n   - URLs contributing to this response:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162/\n\n5. **Questions Relating to Specific Sensors or Channels in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are discussions concerning the sensitivity of specific LIGO sensors to environmental disturbances, leading to queries about whether these sensors are overly sensitive or if the glitches are indicative of a need for recalibration or adjustment. These thoughts are motivated by the observation of glitches like the \'Hz monster\', which seem to recur under specific conditions, hinting at possible sensor-specific sensitivities or anomalies.\n   - URLs contributing to this response:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1721960992, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_eb105741d7', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=828, prompt_tokens=16740, total_tokens=17568))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Which one? Are we seeing a side effect of SUS PI periodically commanding new phase correction values to the fast phase locked loop that applies sine wave forces in the tens of kHz to the test mass quadrants to counteract the oscillation? If so it doesn't seem to have been very successful maybe the rung up mode wasn't the one that SUS PI thought it had to contend with A different mode resonating at a slightly different frequency might have resulted in a long row of less than helpful phase adjustments The logbook provides a little more context but raises yet more questions The Data Quality Shift summary LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep for the week around July tantalizingly notes > There is a glitch cluster just before H lost lock due to environmental factors on Thursday and Friday Okay the glitch cluster on Thursday is precisely what we're dealing with here What about Friday 05?

PI and were unable to be damped down by the GRD and we eventually lost lock Parametric Instability modes and are two which should be familiar to the SUS PI guardian so on this occasion it should have commanded good phases only these two modes are known to be prone to ringing up so fast that the available forces in the suspension actuators aren't strong enough to rein them in Unchecked these modes could cause a lockloss within half a minute or less Thus surviving them for several minutes already counts as a success of sorts Apropos of another lockloss on comments on LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep contemplate whether different PI modes were involved on different days But they don't mention the episode The comment trail alludes to an adjustment of the PR mirror suspension on Fri which could have affected the circulating light power in the arms in turn affecting the likelihood of exciting any PIs but this adjustment happened after both the and episodes So we don't have a coherent picture of the whole affair yet The range drop on looks similar to the one on The latter was associated with a rung up PI oscillation near kHz There's no clear statement about whether that was also the case during the former We have a long row of almost glitch subjects during the former we haven't yet seen any glitches that may have happened during the latter and if they produced Gravity Spy subjects then they can't have looked very similar to the present lot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3390873/ Pair of HF bursts or blip variants 93Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3189894/ Tomte blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390971/ Not no glitch ground motion coupling 41Hz Also S99974400 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390980/ Blip ssp varnish run Slightly odd shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390981/ One of these fancy blippish things entering stage right I never can remember what these are but they always remind me of the Marie Celeste at 4s anyway 03Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Flock? snr 01Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391005/ HF burst or high small thin varnish run blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391017/ I have noticed that when I add a subject to a collection and if that subject is already in the collection it is no longer flagged up in red script I deliberately sent a subject several times to one of my collections and it wasn flagged up in red script However when I looked in the collection there were no duplicates Is this something new ?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

These glitches are not loud individually but occupy the middle frequencies where LIGO is most sensitive. They were first observed in late November and April at Hanford and have similar occurrences at Livingston, indicating a possibly common underlying cause across sites. Specifically, they are mentioned in relation to severe drops in sensitivity and are linked with subjects from both Hanford and Livingston.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146\n\n2. **Concerns with Existing Glitch Classes**:\n   - **Scattered Light Misclassifications:** In Talk Dataset 2, there is significant mention of the machine learning model\'s failure to accurately classify different types of scattered light glitches. Although these glitches have been recognized before, Citizen scientists and researchers identify a need for better differentiation among traditional scattered light, Cairn glitches, and 50 Hz glitches. It is evident that the model currently groups diverse glitch phenomena under a broad category, which could hinder precise analysis.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3399349 \n\n3. **Emerging Questions on Classifications and Technical Aspects**:\n   - **Reevaluation of "Fuzzy Range" Phenomenon:** Participants inquire about the nature of "fuzzy range" episodes, questioning whether similar mechanisms might be at play in both Hanford and Livingston setups. This shows a deeper dive into understanding whether shared environmental factors or instrument characteristics are influencing these observations.\n   - **Inquiries about Machine Learning Classifications:** There is a growing need for updating machine learning classifiers as new glitch types are identified. Questions about integrating new data for model training signify an active engagement in enhancing detection algorithms.\n   - **Subdivision of Scattered Light Class:** Questions arise about the appropriate categorization of glitches within the scattered light classification, indicating a push towards more granular understanding and categorization in machine learning models.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3399349 \n\n4. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins**:\n   - **Environmental Influences on "Fuzzy Range" Glitches:** There are specific hypotheses that these glitches may be influenced by common environmental conditions at both Hanford and Livingston or by shared instrumental characteristics. This hypothesis arises from the observation that similar glitch patterns appear concurrently at different sites.\n   - **Relation of Glitches to External Environmental Factors:** Some glitches are speculated to be caused by external factors like earthquakes or heavy machinery, as indicated by the timing of glitches and external events like earthquakes reported near LIGO sites.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Questions and Thoughts in Talk Dataset 2**:\n   - **Inquiries about Specific Sensors\' Roles:** There are discussions about whether particular sensors or subsystems, like the squeezer subsystem, might be contributing to observed glitches, especially in the context of "fuzzy range" episodes. This reflects a nuanced approach to identifying potential sources of anomalies within the complex LIGO sensor arrays.\n   - **Questions on Channel-Specific Noise Contributions:** Discussions also extend to whether specific channels or frequency bands are more susceptible to certain types of noise or glitches, indicating a targeted approach to diagnose and mitigate these issues.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1721961111, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_7b3074c4b0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=846, prompt_tokens=16740, total_tokens=17586))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Which one? Are we seeing a side effect of SUS PI periodically commanding new phase correction values to the fast phase locked loop that applies sine wave forces in the tens of kHz to the test mass quadrants to counteract the oscillation? If so it doesn't seem to have been very successful maybe the rung up mode wasn't the one that SUS PI thought it had to contend with A different mode resonating at a slightly different frequency might have resulted in a long row of less than helpful phase adjustments The logbook provides a little more context but raises yet more questions The Data Quality Shift summary LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep for the week around July tantalizingly notes > There is a glitch cluster just before H lost lock due to environmental factors on Thursday and Friday Okay the glitch cluster on Thursday is precisely what we're dealing with here What about Friday 05?

PI and were unable to be damped down by the GRD and we eventually lost lock Parametric Instability modes and are two which should be familiar to the SUS PI guardian so on this occasion it should have commanded good phases only these two modes are known to be prone to ringing up so fast that the available forces in the suspension actuators aren't strong enough to rein them in Unchecked these modes could cause a lockloss within half a minute or less Thus surviving them for several minutes already counts as a success of sorts Apropos of another lockloss on comments on LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep contemplate whether different PI modes were involved on different days But they don't mention the episode The comment trail alludes to an adjustment of the PR mirror suspension on Fri which could have affected the circulating light power in the arms in turn affecting the likelihood of exciting any PIs but this adjustment happened after both the and episodes So we don't have a coherent picture of the whole affair yet The range drop on looks similar to the one on The latter was associated with a rung up PI oscillation near kHz There's no clear statement about whether that was also the case during the former We have a long row of almost glitch subjects during the former we haven't yet seen any glitches that may have happened during the latter and if they produced Gravity Spy subjects then they can't have looked very similar to the present lot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3390873/ Pair of HF bursts or blip variants 93Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3189894/ Tomte blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390971/ Not no glitch ground motion coupling 41Hz Also S99974400 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390980/ Blip ssp varnish run Slightly odd shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390981/ One of these fancy blippish things entering stage right I never can remember what these are but they always remind me of the Marie Celeste at 4s anyway 03Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Flock? snr 01Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391005/ HF burst or high small thin varnish run blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391017/ I have noticed that when I add a subject to a collection and if that subject is already in the collection it is no longer flagged up in red script I deliberately sent a subject several times to one of my collections and it wasn flagged up in red script However when I looked in the collection there were no duplicates Is this something new ?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

These are characterized by their occurrence during specific times and involve a series of glitches affecting the middle frequencies, thereby causing significant sensitivity drops in the detectors. This glitch class is possibly linked to environmental factors or operational conditions at the LIGO observatories.\n   - **"Sparse Flock"**: Another proposed class is the "sparse flock," described as a collection of simultaneous blip-like glitches that resemble a flock, but are fewer in number, hence termed "sparse." This class emerges from observing patterns where glitches are not alone but are not abundant enough to form a typical flock. \n   - **URLs contributing to the response**: \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a noted concern regarding the "Scattered Light" glitch class. Participants discuss how this class might be overly broad, encompassing at least three different types of glitches that the machine learning model is failing to distinguish—traditional scattered light, cairn glitches, and 60 Hz glitches. This indicates a need for refined classification to improve model accuracy and glitch understanding.\n   - **URLs contributing to the response**: \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3399349/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science:**\n   - Participants in Talk Dataset 2 raise technical queries about the relationship between specific glitches and environmental influences, questioning whether operational conditions like "fuzzy range" episodes correlate with external vibrations or other environmental factors.\n   - There is curiosity about how certain glitches such as the "sparse flock" might affect the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors, indicating a deeper dive into understanding the impact of these glitches on scientific observations.\n   - The discussions also involve inquiries about the potential need for new hardware or software adjustments at the observatories to better manage or mitigate the effects of identified glitch classes. \n   - **URLs contributing to the response**: \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, hypotheses about the origins of the "fuzzy range" glitches suggest they may be related to specific operational or environmental conditions, such as heavy machinery operating nearby or changes in the ambient environment affecting the detectors.\n   - There is a hypothesis that the "sparse flock" glitch class could be caused by intermittent electronic or mechanical disturbances that are not constant enough to form regular patterns, suggesting sporadic issues in the detector\'s environment or systems.\n   - **URLs contributing to the response**: \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n\n5. **Connections Between Glitches, Sensors, and Channels:**\n   - Talk Dataset 2 discusses concerns about whether specific glitches are linked to particular sensors or parts of the LIGO detectors, with a focus on understanding if certain sensors are more susceptible to types of glitches like "fuzzy range" or "sparse flock."\n   - This includes questions about whether the configuration or location of sensors might influence the frequency or type of glitches observed, indicating a search for patterns that could inform better sensor placements or protective measures.\n   - **URLs contributing to the response**: \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3395223/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722034408, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_7b3074c4b0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=895, prompt_tokens=16740, total_tokens=17635))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Short description Loud short duration glitches below Hz sometimes alone mostly in regular rows spaced seconds or multiples thereof apart Characteristics All nearly currently known examples come from a single episode at Hanford on during an unattended night shift between about UTC and a probably unrelated lockloss at UTC The underlying cadence appears to persist throughout most of this interval although it may be punctuated by fainter glitchlets or by gaps omitting one or a few time slots as in the first two type specimens I am tempted to argue that we're dealing with a single composite glitch that lasted half an hour Each individual baby Koi is a very close overlapping double with the two constituents separated by less than milliseconds Reported peak frequencies range from to less than Hz SNRs from to more than durations from less than seconds to about seconds sometimes Omicron triggered on a single "doubleclick" sometimes it treated a long run of consecutive baby Koi as a single event Almost all have attracted renderings at Q A few at Q exist g the fifth co type specimen above Hash tags a Collections NB the metadata links do not work at present pending a DYCWMI tool bugfix but will work once the tool has been fixed no training set yet creating one would mostly amount to arranging subjects in chronological order and then avoiding large overlaps between consecutive subjects at same Q Bulk collections growing Baby Koi Fish glitch tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections hikari gaby baby koi fish glitch link to its metadata tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu collection info collection info ?username hikari gaby collection display name baby koi fish glitch by Hikari Gaby H O4b doubleclick baby Koi tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h b doubleclick baby koi link to its metadata tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu collection info collection info ?username zngabitant collection display name h b doubleclick baby koi by ZngabitanT Collaborators hColleen Hikari Gaby Hyena Pak Dinowrawr mitchnanny Remarks Whereas the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search easily groups these subjects together as a fairly homogeneous population the Gravity Spy Machine Learning hasn't been able to place them mis labeling many as Helix some as Paired Doves or Light Modulation and only a minority as Koi Fish or Extremely Loud Having looked at a number of O subjects where I can also extract ASD spectra from the published raw strain data I would guess from their appearance that the baby Koi have fairly steep spectra around This July episode coincides with a marked sensitivity BNS range drop as seen on the Summary Page tab https gwosc org detector status day !

Which one? Are we seeing a side effect of SUS PI periodically commanding new phase correction values to the fast phase locked loop that applies sine wave forces in the tens of kHz to the test mass quadrants to counteract the oscillation? If so it doesn't seem to have been very successful maybe the rung up mode wasn't the one that SUS PI thought it had to contend with A different mode resonating at a slightly different frequency might have resulted in a long row of less than helpful phase adjustments The logbook provides a little more context but raises yet more questions The Data Quality Shift summary LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep for the week around July tantalizingly notes > There is a glitch cluster just before H lost lock due to environmental factors on Thursday and Friday Okay the glitch cluster on Thursday is precisely what we're dealing with here What about Friday 05?

PI and were unable to be damped down by the GRD and we eventually lost lock Parametric Instability modes and are two which should be familiar to the SUS PI guardian so on this occasion it should have commanded good phases only these two modes are known to be prone to ringing up so fast that the available forces in the suspension actuators aren't strong enough to rein them in Unchecked these modes could cause a lockloss within half a minute or less Thus surviving them for several minutes already counts as a success of sorts Apropos of another lockloss on comments on LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep contemplate whether different PI modes were involved on different days But they don't mention the episode The comment trail alludes to an adjustment of the PR mirror suspension on Fri which could have affected the circulating light power in the arms in turn affecting the likelihood of exciting any PIs but this adjustment happened after both the and episodes So we don't have a coherent picture of the whole affair yet The range drop on looks similar to the one on The latter was associated with a rung up PI oscillation near kHz There's no clear statement about whether that was also the case during the former We have a long row of almost glitch subjects during the former we haven't yet seen any glitches that may have happened during the latter and if they produced Gravity Spy subjects then they can't have looked very similar to the present lot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3390873/ Pair of HF bursts or blip variants 93Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3189894/ Tomte blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390971/ Not no glitch ground motion coupling 41Hz Also S99974400 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390980/ Blip ssp varnish run Slightly odd shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390981/ One of these fancy blippish things entering stage right I never can remember what these are but they always remind me of the Marie Celeste at 4s anyway 03Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Flock? snr 01Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391005/ HF burst or high small thin varnish run blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391017/ I have noticed that when I add a subject to a collection and if that subject is already in the collection it is no longer flagged up in red script I deliberately sent a subject several times to one of my collections and it wasn flagged up in red script However when I looked in the collection there were no duplicates Is this something new ?

They are part of the Koi Fish glitch They are artefacts of the data processing arising when a loud short duration glitch with much of its noise near Hz interacts with the filtering that removes the ever present Hz noise from the electricity mains supplies Similarly the "lighthouse" effects arise in other subjects when a short duration glitch has enough noise near Hz where the fundamental violin modes ever present to some extent are filtered out Very loud glitches can acquire such artefacts at a number of other frequencies and will then turn into "anglerfish" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/ Thank you ZngabitanT https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/ Blip at with a tomte at which probably has its own object Also diffraction grating https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396657/ Doesn't look like the typical scattered light even with the quiet band between 20Hz The three loud glitches above that band and below 32Hz remind me of a streamlined fish and the single glitch below that band looks like a flattened 'c' https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396667/ non symmetry koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396682/ maybe 64Hz fuzzy range loud case https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396767/ Atypical koi fish tail off center at also diffraction grating above about 32Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396891/ 128Hz ripple with 'rain' above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396893/ Another Not No Glitch 41Hz Ground motion coupling Also S S S on 2024 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396948/ Fuzzy? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396951/ Richland WA earthquake Nessie 86Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396965/ Not no glitch Ground motion coupling from 41Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396974/ 52Hz ADF transient https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396979/ https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep around UTC summertime at Hanford sorry can remember what this is called Lockloss no obvious cause https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396994/ Scattered light low scattering? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396999/ Whoops At Livingston this had already started on Tuesday around UTC subjects from that day are only now emerging from my cascaded similarity searches in part because only now the search has become deep enough to reach the louder examples which had at first eluded us The tell tale range dip in the gwistat tab https online ligo org plot !

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The "Sparse Flock" is described as involving a central glitch with a notch suggesting a blend of two simultaneous blip-like glitches, implying a group of glitches with fainter surrounding disturbances. The "Fuzzy Range" glitches seem to be correlated with specific range drops and operational issues, appearing similar across different observations and possibly related to specific environmental or operational conditions. \n   - URLs contributing to these descriptions: [Sparse Flock](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146), [Fuzzy Range](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396198).\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Dataset 2, there are expressed concerns about the "Scattered Light" glitch class. Citizen scientists highlight that this class is overly broad and might be encompassing multiple distinct types of glitches. Specifically, they differentiate between "Traditional scattered light glitches," "Cairn glitches," and "Hz glitches," suggesting a need to refine and possibly subdivide this classification for more accurate categorization in machine learning models.\n   - URLs contributing to these concerns: [Scattered Light Concern](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349).\n\n3. **Emerging Questions in Glitch Classifications and Sensory Technology:**\n   - In Dataset 2, there is a notable curiosity about the influence of specific environmental conditions, like weather ("fuzzy range") and seismic activities, on the sensors and the resultant data. Questions arise about how these conditions might systematically affect the frequency and characteristics of observed glitches, urging a deeper examination of environmental shielding or compensation techniques.\n   - Another technological curiosity emerging in Dataset 2 is about how machine learning models could be enhanced to distinguish between similarly appearing glitch categories, such as those ambiguously grouped under "Scattered Light."\n   - URLs contributing to these discussions: [Environmental Questions](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162), [Machine Learning Model Enhancement](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349).\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Dataset 2:**\n   - The "Fuzzy Range" episodes are hypothesized to be related to specific tuning issues in the interferometer\'s squeezer subsystem, potentially affecting the mirror FC at the far end of the filter cavity, influencing phase noise at multiples of a 62Hz fundamental. This hypothesis shows a direct attempt to link observed data anomalies with specific mechanical or operational aspects of the LIGO apparatus.\n   - URLs contributing to this hypothesis: [Fuzzy Range Hypothesis](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162).\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Questions in Dataset 2:**\n   - In Dataset 2, discussions emerge about possible sensor-specific issues, particularly questioning the influence of the squeezer subsystem on observed glitches. There are inquiries into whether the subsystem malfunctions are just victims of a common environmental influence or if they themselves are inducing anomalies detectable in the gravitational wave data. This suggests a growing awareness and concern among citizen scientists about how different components of the sensor apparatus might contribute distinctly to data quality.\n   - URLs contributing to this discussion: [Sensor Specific Concerns](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162).', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722308365, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_0993c4a4c0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=795, prompt_tokens=19593, total_tokens=20388))

    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow? I'll be travelling tomorrow and may not be able to follow up further before Friday https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Well spotted! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3398448/ Yes well noted The Livingston engineers are still hunting for the cause They haven't yet used the word "fuzzy" to describe this phenomenon instead calling it " Hz monster" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep or "Big ugly" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ I hope big ugly isn the sensitive type! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ Surely not given what it's been doing to LLO's sensitivity curve !

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

It is noted for its connection with specific large-scale environmental or operational scenarios that result in distinctive and recurrent signal patterns. The citizen scientists discuss the potential origins related to operational settings or environmental factors affecting the sensors. \n   - **Sparse Flock**: This class is suggested due to the distinct pattern of glitches resembling a flock, but with fewer members and more dispersed occurrences. It emphasizes the nuanced differences in glitch patterns that could indicate different underlying causes or sensor responses.\n   (URLs influencing response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/zngabitant/l-b-fuzzy-range-episode-16ff)\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - Concerns are raised about the **Scattered Light** classification, as it seems to be a catch-all category that might be oversimplifying the distinctions between different types of glitches. The discussion suggests that there are at least three sub-classes within what is currently classified as Scattered Light, indicating a need for refinement in classification to enhance the accuracy of glitch identification.\n   - The classification of **Koi Fish** glitches also faces scrutiny for potentially including different types of glitches under one banner, which might obscure the specific characteristics and origins of each type.\n   (URLs influencing response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/)\n\n3. **Emerging Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Questions arise about the specific frequencies and durations that define the newly observed glitch classes, such as the Sparse Flock and Fuzzy Range Episode. This reflects a deeper engagement with the technical aspects of glitch analysis and classification.\n   - There are inquiries about how external factors like weather or operational changes at the LIGO sites might be influencing the occurrence and characteristics of specific glitches, indicating a growing interest in the environmental and operational contexts of gravitational wave detection.\n   - Discussions also explore the potential for machine learning improvements, with suggestions for retraining models to better distinguish between subtly different glitch classes. This indicates a proactive approach to refining detection and classification techniques based on citizen science observations.\n   (URLs influencing response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/)\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - There are specific hypotheses about the origins of the Fuzzy Range Episode glitches, suggesting they may be related to operational issues such as squeezer subsystem malfunctions or environmental factors impacting sensor behavior.\n   - The Sparse Flock glitches are hypothesized to be caused by environmental disturbances that are less intense or less frequent, leading to the sparser and more dispersed appearance of these glitches in spectrograms.\n   - The hypothesis that certain glitches, especially those classified under Scattered Light, might be due to specific operational settings or maintenance activities at the LIGO sites, suggests a direct link between human-induced activities and glitch occurrences.\n   (URLs influencing response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3397455/)\n\n5. **Sensor or Channel-Specific Issues in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - There are discussions regarding whether specific sensors or channels at the LIGO facilities might be more susceptible to certain types of glitches, such as those observed in the Fuzzy Range Episode. This indicates a nuanced understanding of how different parts of the experimental setup might differently impact data quality.\n   - Questions are raised about the potential for certain sensors to exhibit unique responses to environmental conditions, leading to the suggestion that some sensors might need recalibration or targeted monitoring to reduce the incidence of specific glitch types.\n   (URLs influencing response: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3397461/)', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722315929, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_0993c4a4c0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=948, prompt_tokens=19593, total_tokens=20541))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow? I'll be travelling tomorrow and may not be able to follow up further before Friday https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Well spotted! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3398448/ Yes well noted The Livingston engineers are still hunting for the cause They haven't yet used the word "fuzzy" to describe this phenomenon instead calling it " Hz monster" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep or "Big ugly" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ I hope big ugly isn the sensitive type! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ Surely not given what it's been doing to LLO's sensitivity curve !

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The term "sparse flock" emphasizes the dispersed arrangement of these glitches, hinting at their simultaneous occurrence but scattered distribution. \n   - **Fuzzy Range**: The classification "fuzzy range" is introduced to describe glitches that exhibit a fuzzy appearance in the data, potentially linked to medium frequency noise disturbances. This category reflects the citizen scientists\' observation of noise that does not fit into the clean patterns of known glitch types and is characterized by its "fuzzy" spectral appearance.\n   URLs contributing to the responses: \n   - Sparse Flock: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n   - Fuzzy Range: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396198/\n\n2. **Concerns About Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - **Scattered Light Classification Concerns**: In Talk Dataset 2, citizen scientists express concerns about the misclassification of scattered light glitches by the machine learning model. They point out that the model often conflates distinct types of scattered light glitches, leading to incorrect categorization, which affects the training and accuracy of the model.\n   URL contributing to the response:\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions on Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - Citizen scientists in Talk Dataset 2 question the specific characteristics that define certain glitch classes like "Cairn" and "Hz glitches," reflecting their desire to refine classification criteria. This curiosity helps improve machine learning models by providing clearer distinctions between similar-looking but different-origin glitches.\n   - Questions about the technical setup and response of sensors to environmental factors suggest an inclination towards understanding the deeper mechanics of LIGO operations. For instance, discussions about how specific sensors react to environmental noises or perturbations show a nuanced approach to analyzing data quality.\n   URL contributing to the responses:\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n\n4. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Environmental Influence on \'Fuzzy Range\' Glitches**: Citizen scientists hypothesize that "fuzzy range" glitches could be influenced by environmental factors affecting the sensors, possibly medium-frequency noise or operational disturbances in the interferometer setup. They suggest that external conditions like seismic activity or operational anomalies in nearby equipment could correlate with the occurrences of these glitches.\n   - **Squeezer Subsystem Influence**: Another hypothesis involves the squeezer subsystem of LIGO potentially coupling noise into the interferometer, indicated by the recurring "fuzzy range" episodes corresponding with squeezer unlocks or disturbances.\n   URLs contributing to the responses:\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396198/\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162/\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Issues and Thoughts in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Citizen scientists raise questions about whether certain glitches are specifically associated with either the Hanford or Livingston LIGO sites. For instance, they discuss the "fuzzy range" episodes possibly being linked to the operational states or specific environmental conditions at these sites, reflecting a deeper inquiry into site-specific data behavior and sensor responses.\n   URL contributing to the response:\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396198/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722316198, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_0993c4a4c0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=789, prompt_tokens=19593, total_tokens=20382))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

LVK sensitivity curves https gwosc org summary pages detector status cache day G1H1L1V OBSERVING HOFT SPECTRUM png tab https gwosc org detector status day And at the frequencies corresponding to the "yardarms" there'll be vertical spikes sticking out These are what the engineers mean when they talk about spectral lines in the measured gravitational strain data stream Normally they're filtered out completely before our subject images are produced So we don't get to see them in our subjects unless there's either a loud glitch upsetting the filtering or unless something has made them fluctuate in intensity on a timescale shorter than about seconds https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Thank you Is there any particular classification other than extremely loud?

Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

This description highlights an ongoing exploration of glitch patterns that exhibit simultaneous or closely spaced occurrences, potentially indicating a new subcategory of flock-like glitches. \n   - **"Fuzzy Range"** is another term that arises, characterized by glitches that visually appear as fuzzy or blurry in the spectrogram. This name reflects their unclear and diffuse appearance, possibly pointing to a unique underlying mechanism different from sharper, more defined glitches.\n   - URLs contributing to this analysis include:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396198/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is an expressed need for refining the machine learning model because certain glitches like **"Scattered Light"** are incorrectly classified. This indicates ongoing challenges in accurately categorizing glitches, with the machine learning model sometimes conflating different glitch classes that share superficial similarities.\n   - URLs contributing to this analysis include:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Science:**\n   - Users in Talk Dataset 2 are inquisitive about the specific characteristics that define the newly proposed glitch classes like "Sparse Flock" and "Fuzzy Range." They are keen on understanding how these new classes differ significantly in their spectral features from already known classes.\n   - There are questions about the effectiveness of current classification tools and methodologies, indicating a desire to enhance the accuracy of glitch identification.\n   - The discussion extends to the technical aspects of gravitational wave science, where users are curious about the physical implications of misclassified glitches on the overall data integrity and gravitational wave detection.\n   - URLs contributing to this analysis include:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/\n\n4. **Hypotheses about Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - There are hypotheses that some glitches, particularly the "Fuzzy Range" episodes, might be related to squeezer subsystem malfunctions, suggesting a technical origin within the LIGO\'s instrumental setup.\n   - Another hypothesis proposes that environmental factors like seismic activities could be stimulating certain glitches, noted from the correlation with recorded seismic events and glitch occurrences.\n   - URLs contributing to this analysis include:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3398445/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are discussions about whether the observed new glitch classes like "Sparse Flock" and "Fuzzy Range" are prevalent in one LIGO detector more than the other (Hanford vs. Livingston). This suggests an interest in understanding if certain sensors or channels are more susceptible to specific types of glitches.\n   - URLs contributing to this analysis include:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722316605, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_0993c4a4c0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=786, prompt_tokens=19593, total_tokens=20379))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

I realise I haven been doing as much GS lately so am not completely up to date Thank you https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3391042/ Flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391046/ It still works as before for me when I do it from the subject's Talk page Do you see the changed behaviour when you're adding a subject while you're still in the Classifier before clicking on "Done" or "Done Talk"? Things could conceivable work differently there e in the new Zooniverse user interface frontend while Talk pages still use the old frontend but this is something I wouldn't notice myself because I practically never collect a subject before hitting "Done Talk" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3391042/ I will try that I save before clicking Done and Talk in case it disappears sometimes happens with me usually my fault Thank you https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3391042/ Well spotted! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390980/ These extremely loud glitches usually get rendered at Q when they appear central stage but often like here attract higher Q renderings when there's an extraneous offset trigger And then all these "yardarms" will show up Each correspends to a frequency where there's a lot of background noise all the time because such loud glitches momentarily mess up the filtering that normally suppresses such stationary noise Among others we can make out Hz electricity mains and its third harmonic the thin one at Hz halfway on the logarithmic scale between and the fifth harmonic at Hz is blended with other stuff nearby resulting in a rather thick "yardarm" there we also see the fundamental violin modes near Hz and their second harmonics near Hz and there are a few others that I can't explain offhand Now if we were to plot noise levels versus frequency with the logarithmic frequency axis horizontal instead of vertical and logarithmic noise intensity on the vertical axis we'd get averaged over the same day from which this subject came something like the red curve below ! LVK sensitivity curves https gwosc org summary pages detector status cache day G1H1L1V OBSERVING HOFT SPECTRUM png tab https gwosc org detector status day And at the frequencies corresponding to the "yardarms" there'll be vertical spikes sticking out These are what the engineers mean when they talk about spectral lines in the measured gravitational strain data stream Normally they're filtered out completely before our subject images are produced So we don't get to see them in our subjects unless there's either a loud glitch upsetting the filtering or unless something has made them fluctuate in intensity on a timescale shorter than about seconds https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Thank you Is there any particular classification other than extremely loud?

Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread!

The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

This classification is suggested due to the observation of glitches that appear to be blends of two near-simultaneous blip-like glitches, which they describe as having a central feature with a notable notch, suggesting a composite rather than a singular event. This classification aims to address configurations that don\'t strictly fit into the existing "Flock" category due to their sparser occurrence and distinct features.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes**\n   - Concerns are raised about the "Scattered Light" classification, where it\'s noted that this class might be too broad, encompassing multiple distinct types of glitches. Citizen scientists and researchers are observing that traditional scattered light glitches, cairn glitches, and 60 Hz glitches are often lumped together, which could confuse the machine learning model used for automated classification. They suggest refining and retraining the model to better differentiate these subclasses.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, questions emerge about the specific attributes of glitches, such as their frequency ranges and durations, particularly concerning the newly observed classes like "Cairn" glitches. Citizen scientists are interested in defining the typical frequency and duration that characterize these glitches to aid in more accurate classification and understanding.\n   - There is curiosity about whether environmental factors or intrinsic sensor issues cause specific glitch patterns, leading to discussions on how to distinguish these origins effectively.\n   - Questions are also raised about the interaction between glitches and gravitational wave detection equipment, particularly how certain glitches might affect the sensitivity of LIGO detectors and what that implies for data integrity and gravitational wave observations.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2**\n   - A specific hypothesis discussed concerns the "Fuzzy Range" episodes, where it\'s suggested that these might be linked to the squeezer subsystem of the LIGO detectors. The hypothesis posits that this subsystem could be coupling medium frequency noise into the interferometer, affecting the detector\'s sensitivity. This is analytically motivated by observed correlations between squeezer operation times and occurrences of fuzzy range glitches.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162/\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Connections to Specific Sensors or Channels**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a specific discussion about whether the observed "fuzzy range" glitches at the Livingston LIGO site might be linked to specific parts of the detector setup, such as the squeezer subsystem or the FC mirror suspension movements. These questions are driven by observations of correlations between specific component behaviors and glitch occurrences, suggesting a deeper investigation into how different detector components might influence data quality.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722317154, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_0993c4a4c0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=722, prompt_tokens=19593, total_tokens=20315))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

If so it doesn't seem to have been very successful maybe the rung up mode wasn't the one that SUS PI thought it had to contend with A different mode resonating at a slightly different frequency might have resulted in a long row of less than helpful phase adjustments The logbook provides a little more context but raises yet more questions The Data Quality Shift summary LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep for the week around July tantalizingly notes > There is a glitch cluster just before H lost lock due to environmental factors on Thursday and Friday Okay the glitch cluster on Thursday is precisely what we're dealing with here What about Friday 05?

PI and were unable to be damped down by the GRD and we eventually lost lock Parametric Instability modes and are two which should be familiar to the SUS PI guardian so on this occasion it should have commanded good phases only these two modes are known to be prone to ringing up so fast that the available forces in the suspension actuators aren't strong enough to rein them in Unchecked these modes could cause a lockloss within half a minute or less Thus surviving them for several minutes already counts as a success of sorts Apropos of another lockloss on comments on LHO tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep contemplate whether different PI modes were involved on different days But they don't mention the episode The comment trail alludes to an adjustment of the PR mirror suspension on Fri which could have affected the circulating light power in the arms in turn affecting the likelihood of exciting any PIs but this adjustment happened after both the and episodes So we don't have a coherent picture of the whole affair yet The range drop on looks similar to the one on The latter was associated with a rung up PI oscillation near kHz There's no clear statement about whether that was also the case during the former We have a long row of almost glitch subjects during the former we haven't yet seen any glitches that may have happened during the latter and if they produced Gravity Spy subjects then they can't have looked very similar to the present lot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3390873/ Pair of HF bursts or blip variants 93Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3189894/ Tomte blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390971/ Not no glitch ground motion coupling 41Hz Also S99974400 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390980/ Blip ssp varnish run Slightly odd shape https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3390981/ One of these fancy blippish things entering stage right I never can remember what these are but they always remind me of the Marie Celeste at 4s anyway 03Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3375093/ Flock? snr 01Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391005/ HF burst or high small thin varnish run blip https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3391017/ I have noticed that when I add a subject to a collection and if that subject is already in the collection it is no longer flagged up in red script I deliberately sent a subject several times to one of my collections and it wasn flagged up in red script However when I looked in the collection there were no duplicates Is this something new ?

They are part of the Koi Fish glitch They are artefacts of the data processing arising when a loud short duration glitch with much of its noise near Hz interacts with the filtering that removes the ever present Hz noise from the electricity mains supplies Similarly the "lighthouse" effects arise in other subjects when a short duration glitch has enough noise near Hz where the fundamental violin modes ever present to some extent are filtered out Very loud glitches can acquire such artefacts at a number of other frequencies and will then turn into "anglerfish" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/ Thank you ZngabitanT https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/ Blip at with a tomte at which probably has its own object Also diffraction grating https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396657/ Doesn't look like the typical scattered light even with the quiet band between 20Hz The three loud glitches above that band and below 32Hz remind me of a streamlined fish and the single glitch below that band looks like a flattened 'c' https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396667/ non symmetry koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396682/ maybe 64Hz fuzzy range loud case https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396767/ Atypical koi fish tail off center at also diffraction grating above about 32Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396891/ 128Hz ripple with 'rain' above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396893/ Another Not No Glitch 41Hz Ground motion coupling Also S S S on 2024 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396948/ Fuzzy? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396951/ Richland WA earthquake Nessie 86Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396965/ Not no glitch Ground motion coupling from 41Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396974/ 52Hz ADF transient https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396979/ https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep around UTC summertime at Hanford sorry can remember what this is called Lockloss no obvious cause https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396994/ Scattered light low scattering? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396999/ Whoops At Livingston this had already started on Tuesday around UTC subjects from that day are only now emerging from my cascaded similarity searches in part because only now the search has become deep enough to reach the louder examples which had at first eluded us The tell tale range dip in the gwistat tab https online ligo org plot !

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The "Sparse Flock" is suggested to involve a central glitch with additional, nearly simultaneous glitches around it, representing a less dense arrangement than previously categorized flocks. This classification addresses the need for differentiating between densely and sparsely populated glitch groupings.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146/\n\n### Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n1. **Scattered Light Misclassifications**: In Dataset 2, there\'s a notable discussion about the misclassification of scattered light glitches. Researchers and citizen scientists express concerns that the machine learning model currently used misclassifies different subtypes of scattered light glitches, leading to inaccurate categorizations. This ongoing issue underscores the need for refining machine learning models to distinguish between subtle variations within the scattered light glitch class.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n\n### Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects\n1. **Subclassification of Extremely Loud Glitches**: Citizens scientists in Dataset 2 discuss whether extremely loud glitches that are not as loud as the loudest known examples should be considered a separate subclass. This inquiry reflects a deeper engagement with the nuances of glitch classifications and suggests an evolving understanding of the amplitude spectrum of recorded glitches.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396198/\n\n2. **Technical Inquiries About Machine Learning Classifications**: There is an emerging discussion about the need to update the machine learning model to include new glitch classes observed in the latest data. This reflects a broader interest in how machine learning tools are applied in scientific research and a deeper curiosity about the intersection of artificial intelligence and physics research.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n\n3. **Inquiries on Data Processing Artefacts**: Questions arise about artefacts related to data processing, specifically how certain frequencies interact with the filtering techniques. This discussion indicates growing interest in the technical aspects of data handling and the effects of processing on the interpretation of glitches.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170/\n\n### Hypotheses About Glitch Origins\n1. **Environmental Influences and Sensor Noise**: In Dataset 2, there is a hypothesis that certain glitches might be linked to environmental factors affecting the sensors, such as "fuzzy range" episodes potentially tied to medium frequency noise in the environment. This hypothesis is driven by observations of coinciding external conditions and glitch occurrences, suggesting a relationship between environmental noise and observed data anomalies.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162/\n\n### Sensor-Specific Questions or Thoughts\n1. **Sensor-Specific Glitch Occurrences**: In Dataset 2, discussions surface about whether certain glitches are specifically associated with particular sensors or detector sites. For example, there is a conversation about glitches that appear predominantly at one LIGO site but not the other, leading to questions about site-specific environmental influences or sensor configurations.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/\n\nThis analysis highlights how citizen scientists are not only expanding the catalog of glitch classifications but also engaging in more sophisticated discussions about the technical and environmental factors influencing gravitational wave detection.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The description points to an interesting dynamic where glitches almost merge into a single visual but maintain distinct origins. This exemplifies the evolving complexity in glitch categorization. *(URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396146)*\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - **Inadequacy in Machine Learning Classifications:** There are concerns about the machine learning model misclassifying certain glitch types, particularly "Scattered Light," into overly broad categories. This issue highlights the ongoing challenges in refining automated classification systems to better match the nuanced observations of citizen scientists. *(URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349)*\n   - **Variability Within Known Classes:** Discussions in Dataset 2 highlight uncertainties about classifying variations within known glitch types such as "Wheatgrass" and "Flock". The community is actively debating whether certain observed features should lead to new subclassifications or refined definitions for existing classes. *(URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170)*\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science:**\n   - **Complexity of Glitch Interactions:** Questions are raised about how multiple glitches interact and whether these interactions could signify underlying physical phenomena or artifacts of data processing. This curiosity drives deeper inquiry into the nature of gravitational wave data. *(URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396170)*\n   - **Impact of Environmental Factors on Glitches:** There\'s an emerging dialogue on how local environmental conditions could influence the frequency and characteristics of glitches. This line of questioning reflects a growing understanding of the delicate balance in gravitational wave detection. *(URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396994)*\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Causal Connection Between Squeezer Subsystems and Glitches:** A hypothesis discussed is that variations in the squeezer subsystems might be affecting the interferometer’s performance, especially focusing on medium frequencies. The analytical motivation involves understanding the intricate feedback loops within LIGO\'s operational mechanics, and how subsystem malfunctions might manifest as noise or glitches in the data. *(URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162)*\n\n5. **Sensor or Channel Specific Issues and Thoughts in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Localized Sensor Disturbances:** There is speculation on whether certain glitches might be specifically tied to localized disturbances or malfunctions in certain sensor arrays or channels. This contemplation stems from observations of glitches appearing during specific operational conditions or physical setups, prompting questions about causative links between observed data anomalies and specific equipment or configurations. *(URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162)*', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1722317551, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_0993c4a4c0', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=695, prompt_tokens=19593, total_tokens=20288))

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread!

Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled July 26th am Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you dethodav for addressing the questions It is useful to have those defining features for the Cairn class Please note that the collection Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set is still inaccessible yielding the same error message as mentioned before Edit it works now thanks!

Some further questions and remarks So I gather the point is to teach the ML about glitches that it should not label as Scattered Light but currently does while also making sure that it will still recognize subjects that are instances of "traditional" Scattered Light Will you be able to train the ML on collections of "mere" counterexamples penalizing it for misclassifications without assigning a specific other "good" class to each "this isn't Scattered Light" subject? I understand that this hasn't been possible in the past If this still isn't possible then we need to be more careful about the training sets we're going to build They should not just collect other than Scattered Light subjects but each of them should collect subjects that really belong together into a different class They should focus on core rather than fringe examples of these different classes And they should capture the essence of each of these other classes In particular they shouldn't be limited to subjects rendered at Q only when the other class under consideration has been attracting renderings at other Q values in signficant numbers I'm hopeful that Cairn will turn out to be a good if not very populous class grouping glitches together that share a common origin As far as I can see so far it will have to include examples rendered at lower Q values and it is mostly a Livingston thing "Similar" looking subjects from Hanford are numerous but are invariably something else most Scattered Light from Hanford O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3013446?comment O4b looks somewhat cairn ish except for the Q "wheatgrass" renderings On the other hand I'm sceptical about the Hz subjects The three initial gold examples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set may turn out to be three different things spanning a range of peak frequencies as reported by Omicron and one of them visibly sloping I don't think they are tied to any specific fixed frequency features spectral lines Livingston has had a few ! glitches specifically at Hz about a year ago see LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep tab is one of these that has got labeled Scattered Light with not very high confidence but others like tab got more plausibly filed under Low Frequency Lines I'm not aware of any more recent fixed frequency glitch sources at Livingston in the Hz ballpark From Hanford we have firstly the medium frequency ripples and combs tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk showing up around and and and Hz the ones peaking near Hz have occasionally received Scattered Light labels g tab but more often Low Frequency Lines tab or No Glitch tab and secondly the Hz floor motion coupling tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches could last up to several minutes at a time and often got whitened out so thoroughly that the image producing part of Gravity Spy picked a Q value at random and left us and the ML with nothing to see These subjects are still recognizable by their peak frequencies and durations but hopeless to classify purely by the resulting images tab is a rare example rendered at Q that has attracted a Scattered Light label Here too Low Frequency Lines and No Glitch occur more often Both of these glitch class proposals already link to relevant collections But the many "NotNoGlitch" examples won't do much good in training a purely image based ML They would require a more sophisticated ML which also pays attention to the Omicron metadata peak frequency duration and SNR and perhaps one which receives renderings at all four Q values as its image input not just at a single choice which may or may not match the given glitch very well I can't help noticing that all the current members of the Traditional Scattering Gold Set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with one possible exception are marginal cases of Livingston's Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk marginal in the sense that the ground was moving at somewhat less than Hz and the penduluming item excited below its resonance was able to follow the ground motion so the arches we see are spaced more than seconds apart and all of them are Q renderings The glitch subclass proposal already links to a more representative candidate training set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant training set l a dot hz scattering from O4a These glitches have not changed much between O4a and O4b But apropos of this another question springs to mind Many of these Hz scattering glitches stay below the Hz band of loud stationary noise and thus do less harm to clean observing time than those which do show up loudly above Hz As long as we're aiming to classify by common causes and common coupling paths they all belong together Nevertheless would it make sense to maintain a distinction between very low frequency Scattered Light peak frequency below Hz and the more harmful sort peak above Hz ?

If such in which way should we ascertain that we are looking at the same origin? SIm search still does not provide event time values while not every event is recorded in the log books So perhaps by matching SNR and duration between representative events? The useful glitch plotter cannot be used with unpublished data to visualize different renderings Other ways to be recalled? If there is no particular answer for then should all Q value renderings that look like Cairn within the pre defined frequency duration set of values above be collected perhaps in further subdivided collections according to Q ? Edit I reviewed notes from what I recalled now so that from the four Q values used the one that yields the highest SNR is used to render the spectrogram Many thanks!

Another fuzzy? Or a Cairn that happened to happen by pure chance in the middle of that Fuzzy Range episode? Your guess is as good as mine Well my train of thought at this very initial stage of affairs as to why not Cairn and also after looking at the Fuzzy link provided Well above Hz If they are mixed it is very difficult to discern visually Detached part or concomitant non related glitch I feel that the Cairn morphology after the real cairns seems to or is desired to form a pyramid shape mainly seen in frame which the subject in question does not form As if Fuzzy well not sure as they seem to be taller in general though it may fit the other characteristics defined for such class So I would venture not Cairns and perhaps Fuzzy or mixed undefined Thanks again for this interesting conversation Once I post my initial findings in collections more will be hopefully clarified and further defined Thanks a lot! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Many thanks for your comments and follow on questions! As to the definition of Cairns the provided golden set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set includes examples where the bright parts reach up to about Hz the lower cutoff at about Hz is determined by the upper edge of the loud but whitened away from sight stationary noise band and the visible durations usually exceed seconds and can reach about seconds The durations reported by Omicron can be even longer sometimes exceeding seconds In this regard I guess we should do as dethodav does not as dethodav says Now having looked at many subjects in the past and having used the glitch plotter on O and earlier subjects imagine what a lower Q rendering would do to such a glitch It is impossible to predict the precise shape the Q transform is a projection it loses information but we can foretell that there'll be somewhat less stretching of the overall shape in the horizontal direction and somewhat more in the vertical direction so the visible durations will tend to be a bit shorter while the vertical extent may then stick out a bit beyond the Hz range the more so the lower the Q value is chosen I haven't yet found convincing examples at Q or but I'm keeping my eyes open I've recently had to deal with all those "fuzzy range" subjects which can get rendered at any old Q so my brain is currently flooded with illustrations of how the rendering choice affects the appearance of an underlying population that's intrinsically uniform with some variability One reason why I said up front that lower Q examples of Cairns must exist is that I had already run into several candidates a few weeks ago including and as by catch during similarity searches based on other kinds of subjects I didn't immediately know what to do with them and didn't yet have a name for them and moreover I was very busy with other things that needed urgent attention Thus for a while these candidates were left sitting in very different corners of my queues not wanting to neatly fit anywhere I'm now digging through all these odd corners and trying to re unite the puzzle pieces that now suddenly seem to belong together It's certainly true that lower Q renderings of cairns are going to look a bit less like their namesakes I'm also having another look at possible "around Hz" non arching glitches from Livingston I may be able to come up with a few more probably not very many though https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thanks again for the follow up and visualizations Succinctly a We extend Cairn to the Hz range and up to about correct?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The description suggests these glitches are akin to cairns (piles of rocks), which may appear more as scattered noise without a distinct pattern typically seen in other scattering-related glitches. This glitch class reflects an attempt to refine the categorization of scattered light phenomena to better fit observed data patterns. URLs: [Cairn Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349)\n\n2. **Concerns with Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - **Scattered Light classification issues**: In Talk Dataset 2, there is a detailed discussion about the inadequacy of the Scattered Light classification. It is noted that various subclasses within what is currently categorized broadly as Scattered Light are being incorrectly grouped, leading to calls for a more nuanced categorization. This concern highlights ongoing challenges in accurately classifying glitches that may share superficial similarities but differ significantly in their underlying characteristics. URLs: [Scattered Light Issues](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349)\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Science:**\n   - **Questions about the "Cairn" glitch type**: Citizen scientists are eager to understand whether the newly proposed Cairn glitch type correlates with specific sensor outputs or environmental conditions. This reflects a deepening engagement with the data, where participants are not just classifying but also seeking to understand the physical or technical origins of the glitches they observe. URLs: [Cairn Glitch Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349)\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Environmental influences and hardware issues**: In Talk Dataset 2, there\'s a hypothesis that a \'fuzzy range\' glitch could be linked to specific environmental conditions or hardware instabilities, specifically mentioning a "single cable that was almost fully plugged in and not fully fastened" affecting the data. This reflects a more targeted understanding of how minor setup issues can lead to significant data anomalies. URLs: [Environmental Influence Hypothesis](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162)\n\n5. **Sensor or Channel Specific Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Inquiries about specific detectors\' roles in observed glitches**: Citizen scientists are querying whether certain glitches are predominantly associated with specific LIGO detectors (e.g., Livingston vs. Hanford). They discuss whether the same glitches appear across both sites or are isolated to one, indicating an attempt to link glitches to particular sensor behavior or localized environmental factors.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow? I'll be travelling tomorrow and may not be able to follow up further before Friday https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Well spotted! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3398448/ Yes well noted The Livingston engineers are still hunting for the cause They haven't yet used the word "fuzzy" to describe this phenomenon instead calling it " Hz monster" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep or "Big ugly" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ I hope big ugly isn the sensitive type! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ Surely not given what it's been doing to LLO's sensitivity curve !

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread!

Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled July 26th am Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you dethodav for addressing the questions It is useful to have those defining features for the Cairn class Please note that the collection Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set is still inaccessible yielding the same error message as mentioned before Edit it works now thanks!

Some further questions and remarks So I gather the point is to teach the ML about glitches that it should not label as Scattered Light but currently does while also making sure that it will still recognize subjects that are instances of "traditional" Scattered Light Will you be able to train the ML on collections of "mere" counterexamples penalizing it for misclassifications without assigning a specific other "good" class to each "this isn't Scattered Light" subject? I understand that this hasn't been possible in the past If this still isn't possible then we need to be more careful about the training sets we're going to build They should not just collect other than Scattered Light subjects but each of them should collect subjects that really belong together into a different class They should focus on core rather than fringe examples of these different classes And they should capture the essence of each of these other classes In particular they shouldn't be limited to subjects rendered at Q only when the other class under consideration has been attracting renderings at other Q values in signficant numbers I'm hopeful that Cairn will turn out to be a good if not very populous class grouping glitches together that share a common origin As far as I can see so far it will have to include examples rendered at lower Q values and it is mostly a Livingston thing "Similar" looking subjects from Hanford are numerous but are invariably something else most Scattered Light from Hanford O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3013446?comment O4b looks somewhat cairn ish except for the Q "wheatgrass" renderings On the other hand I'm sceptical about the Hz subjects The three initial gold examples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set may turn out to be three different things spanning a range of peak frequencies as reported by Omicron and one of them visibly sloping I don't think they are tied to any specific fixed frequency features spectral lines Livingston has had a few ! glitches specifically at Hz about a year ago see LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep tab is one of these that has got labeled Scattered Light with not very high confidence but others like tab got more plausibly filed under Low Frequency Lines I'm not aware of any more recent fixed frequency glitch sources at Livingston in the Hz ballpark From Hanford we have firstly the medium frequency ripples and combs tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk showing up around and and and Hz the ones peaking near Hz have occasionally received Scattered Light labels g tab but more often Low Frequency Lines tab or No Glitch tab and secondly the Hz floor motion coupling tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches could last up to several minutes at a time and often got whitened out so thoroughly that the image producing part of Gravity Spy picked a Q value at random and left us and the ML with nothing to see These subjects are still recognizable by their peak frequencies and durations but hopeless to classify purely by the resulting images tab is a rare example rendered at Q that has attracted a Scattered Light label Here too Low Frequency Lines and No Glitch occur more often Both of these glitch class proposals already link to relevant collections But the many "NotNoGlitch" examples won't do much good in training a purely image based ML They would require a more sophisticated ML which also pays attention to the Omicron metadata peak frequency duration and SNR and perhaps one which receives renderings at all four Q values as its image input not just at a single choice which may or may not match the given glitch very well I can't help noticing that all the current members of the Traditional Scattering Gold Set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with one possible exception are marginal cases of Livingston's Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk marginal in the sense that the ground was moving at somewhat less than Hz and the penduluming item excited below its resonance was able to follow the ground motion so the arches we see are spaced more than seconds apart and all of them are Q renderings The glitch subclass proposal already links to a more representative candidate training set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant training set l a dot hz scattering from O4a These glitches have not changed much between O4a and O4b But apropos of this another question springs to mind Many of these Hz scattering glitches stay below the Hz band of loud stationary noise and thus do less harm to clean observing time than those which do show up loudly above Hz As long as we're aiming to classify by common causes and common coupling paths they all belong together Nevertheless would it make sense to maintain a distinction between very low frequency Scattered Light peak frequency below Hz and the more harmful sort peak above Hz ?

If such in which way should we ascertain that we are looking at the same origin? SIm search still does not provide event time values while not every event is recorded in the log books So perhaps by matching SNR and duration between representative events? The useful glitch plotter cannot be used with unpublished data to visualize different renderings Other ways to be recalled? If there is no particular answer for then should all Q value renderings that look like Cairn within the pre defined frequency duration set of values above be collected perhaps in further subdivided collections according to Q ? Edit I reviewed notes from what I recalled now so that from the four Q values used the one that yields the highest SNR is used to render the spectrogram Many thanks!

Another fuzzy? Or a Cairn that happened to happen by pure chance in the middle of that Fuzzy Range episode? Your guess is as good as mine Well my train of thought at this very initial stage of affairs as to why not Cairn and also after looking at the Fuzzy link provided Well above Hz If they are mixed it is very difficult to discern visually Detached part or concomitant non related glitch I feel that the Cairn morphology after the real cairns seems to or is desired to form a pyramid shape mainly seen in frame which the subject in question does not form As if Fuzzy well not sure as they seem to be taller in general though it may fit the other characteristics defined for such class So I would venture not Cairns and perhaps Fuzzy or mixed undefined Thanks again for this interesting conversation Once I post my initial findings in collections more will be hopefully clarified and further defined Thanks a lot! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Many thanks for your comments and follow on questions! As to the definition of Cairns the provided golden set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set includes examples where the bright parts reach up to about Hz the lower cutoff at about Hz is determined by the upper edge of the loud but whitened away from sight stationary noise band and the visible durations usually exceed seconds and can reach about seconds The durations reported by Omicron can be even longer sometimes exceeding seconds In this regard I guess we should do as dethodav does not as dethodav says Now having looked at many subjects in the past and having used the glitch plotter on O and earlier subjects imagine what a lower Q rendering would do to such a glitch It is impossible to predict the precise shape the Q transform is a projection it loses information but we can foretell that there'll be somewhat less stretching of the overall shape in the horizontal direction and somewhat more in the vertical direction so the visible durations will tend to be a bit shorter while the vertical extent may then stick out a bit beyond the Hz range the more so the lower the Q value is chosen I haven't yet found convincing examples at Q or but I'm keeping my eyes open I've recently had to deal with all those "fuzzy range" subjects which can get rendered at any old Q so my brain is currently flooded with illustrations of how the rendering choice affects the appearance of an underlying population that's intrinsically uniform with some variability One reason why I said up front that lower Q examples of Cairns must exist is that I had already run into several candidates a few weeks ago including and as by catch during similarity searches based on other kinds of subjects I didn't immediately know what to do with them and didn't yet have a name for them and moreover I was very busy with other things that needed urgent attention Thus for a while these candidates were left sitting in very different corners of my queues not wanting to neatly fit anywhere I'm now digging through all these odd corners and trying to re unite the puzzle pieces that now suddenly seem to belong together It's certainly true that lower Q renderings of cairns are going to look a bit less like their namesakes I'm also having another look at possible "around Hz" non arching glitches from Livingston I may be able to come up with a few more probably not very many though https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thanks again for the follow up and visualizations Succinctly a We extend Cairn to the Hz range and up to about correct?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Cairn Glitches:** This new class is highlighted due to its unique appearance that somewhat resembles piled rocks, lacking a clear arch structure common to traditional scattered light glitches. These glitches seem to bridge the gap between traditional scattered light and another unnamed class, hinting at a unique origin or behavior within the LIGO detectors. They are identified as a challenge for the machine learning model used in Gravity Spy, necessitating retraining to differentiate them from similar-looking glitches.\n   - **Hz Glitches:** Identified as a single line of noise near 1080 Hz, these are distinct from other noise lines and are currently misclassified by automated systems. This class is particularly interesting as it represents a frequency-specific anomaly that might be linked to specific mechanical or environmental factors within the observatories.\n   - **URLs influencing response:** \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/dethodav/hz-gold-set\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/collections/dethodav/cairn-gold-set\n\n**2. Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - **Scattered Light Misclassifications:** There is significant concern that multiple types of glitches are being erroneously classified under the broad category of 'Scattered Light'. This includes new subclasses like Cairn and Hz glitches which, while sharing some superficial characteristics with scattered light, have unique aspects that are currently overlooked by classification algorithms.\n   - **URLs influencing response:** \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/\n\n**3. Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science:**\n   - **Classification Accuracy and Machine Learning:** Scientists and contributors are querying the accuracy of current machine learning models used in classifying glitches, especially with the introduction of new glitch types. There is a growing interest in understanding how these models can be improved to distinguish between subtly different glitch types more effectively.\n   - **Technical Aspects of Glitches:** Questions are emerging about the specific characteristics that define each glitch class, such as frequency range, duration, and appearance in spectrograms.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled July 26th am Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you dethodav for addressing the questions It is useful to have those defining features for the Cairn class Please note that the collection Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set is still inaccessible yielding the same error message as mentioned before Edit it works now thanks!

Some further questions and remarks So I gather the point is to teach the ML about glitches that it should not label as Scattered Light but currently does while also making sure that it will still recognize subjects that are instances of "traditional" Scattered Light Will you be able to train the ML on collections of "mere" counterexamples penalizing it for misclassifications without assigning a specific other "good" class to each "this isn't Scattered Light" subject? I understand that this hasn't been possible in the past If this still isn't possible then we need to be more careful about the training sets we're going to build They should not just collect other than Scattered Light subjects but each of them should collect subjects that really belong together into a different class They should focus on core rather than fringe examples of these different classes And they should capture the essence of each of these other classes In particular they shouldn't be limited to subjects rendered at Q only when the other class under consideration has been attracting renderings at other Q values in signficant numbers I'm hopeful that Cairn will turn out to be a good if not very populous class grouping glitches together that share a common origin As far as I can see so far it will have to include examples rendered at lower Q values and it is mostly a Livingston thing "Similar" looking subjects from Hanford are numerous but are invariably something else most Scattered Light from Hanford O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3013446?comment O4b looks somewhat cairn ish except for the Q "wheatgrass" renderings On the other hand I'm sceptical about the Hz subjects The three initial gold examples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set may turn out to be three different things spanning a range of peak frequencies as reported by Omicron and one of them visibly sloping I don't think they are tied to any specific fixed frequency features spectral lines Livingston has had a few ! glitches specifically at Hz about a year ago see LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep tab is one of these that has got labeled Scattered Light with not very high confidence but others like tab got more plausibly filed under Low Frequency Lines I'm not aware of any more recent fixed frequency glitch sources at Livingston in the Hz ballpark From Hanford we have firstly the medium frequency ripples and combs tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk showing up around and and and Hz the ones peaking near Hz have occasionally received Scattered Light labels g tab but more often Low Frequency Lines tab or No Glitch tab and secondly the Hz floor motion coupling tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches could last up to several minutes at a time and often got whitened out so thoroughly that the image producing part of Gravity Spy picked a Q value at random and left us and the ML with nothing to see These subjects are still recognizable by their peak frequencies and durations but hopeless to classify purely by the resulting images tab is a rare example rendered at Q that has attracted a Scattered Light label Here too Low Frequency Lines and No Glitch occur more often Both of these glitch class proposals already link to relevant collections But the many "NotNoGlitch" examples won't do much good in training a purely image based ML They would require a more sophisticated ML which also pays attention to the Omicron metadata peak frequency duration and SNR and perhaps one which receives renderings at all four Q values as its image input not just at a single choice which may or may not match the given glitch very well I can't help noticing that all the current members of the Traditional Scattering Gold Set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with one possible exception are marginal cases of Livingston's Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk marginal in the sense that the ground was moving at somewhat less than Hz and the penduluming item excited below its resonance was able to follow the ground motion so the arches we see are spaced more than seconds apart and all of them are Q renderings The glitch subclass proposal already links to a more representative candidate training set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant training set l a dot hz scattering from O4a These glitches have not changed much between O4a and O4b But apropos of this another question springs to mind Many of these Hz scattering glitches stay below the Hz band of loud stationary noise and thus do less harm to clean observing time than those which do show up loudly above Hz As long as we're aiming to classify by common causes and common coupling paths they all belong together Nevertheless would it make sense to maintain a distinction between very low frequency Scattered Light peak frequency below Hz and the more harmful sort peak above Hz ?

If such in which way should we ascertain that we are looking at the same origin? SIm search still does not provide event time values while not every event is recorded in the log books So perhaps by matching SNR and duration between representative events? The useful glitch plotter cannot be used with unpublished data to visualize different renderings Other ways to be recalled? If there is no particular answer for then should all Q value renderings that look like Cairn within the pre defined frequency duration set of values above be collected perhaps in further subdivided collections according to Q ? Edit I reviewed notes from what I recalled now so that from the four Q values used the one that yields the highest SNR is used to render the spectrogram Many thanks! Kindy refresh this page as I made edits thank you https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ I was unsure about this subject because of the tail I selected blip but I wanted to Ask info about the tail I read the info already available and they are quite useful https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/2994709/ Huh this is a weird combination of symptoms So it's got nothing to do with new FEM versus old PFE frontend since another FEM project works for you and it affects two different makes of browsers on two devices but not to our knowledge any other users with iPads or MacBooks And moreover if you've been contributing to Gravity Spy on and off for several years there should now be more workflows unlocked for your account beyond the first Summoning one of our researchers Kevin crowston are you able to see anything peculiar on the Gravity Spy project side about the icecreamdoc user account numerical Zooniverse user ID ?

Well I am not convinced here not yet disagree based on the frequency range going far above the approximate Hz per definition and according to the golden set provided they stay the brightest below 64Hz But as we know well variations abound Regarding > One notable difference is that Cairns won't repeat within the bounds of the fourth frames while the Hanford glitches often do at a cadence of about seconds or shorter This is a great point to start differentiating between those Thanks! Then > All of these non examples were returned by a single Similarity Search anchored on one of the given gold standard Cairns I also ran this subject as seed today asking for just results got H and one L with most of the H ones repeating themselves when zoomed out Then > That said I would not yet rule out the possibility that Cairns arise in a similar way it might yet turn out that they really are another form of Scattered Light Alright if the arches go below Hz and dishevelment shows up I may initially stick to the range Hz staying below Hz to see what it yields through cascading searches all within the 5s duration so very few of such returned by sim search Your next question > Anyways Here are some examples of what may be Cairns rendered at Q the first is a bit iffy What do you think? I think that it is nightmare At Q they obviously do not resemble the Q counterparts how are we determining if the former are Cairn when we do not know the trigger? If we need to mainly visualize Cairns and then go deeper into values distribution comparisons and so forth with the mere tools I have on this side sim search not giving event time and clearly no new data released yet for use with the plotter well I would say that I might stick for a while to Q value and build on those deemed fit See where it goes form here Your last question > Now where would you place the next one below? Another fuzzy? Or a Cairn that happened to happen by pure chance in the middle of that Fuzzy Range episode? Your guess is as good as mine Well my train of thought at this very initial stage of affairs as to why not Cairn and also after looking at the Fuzzy link provided Well above Hz If they are mixed it is very difficult to discern visually Detached part or concomitant non related glitch I feel that the Cairn morphology after the real cairns seems to or is desired to form a pyramid shape mainly seen in frame which the subject in question does not form As if Fuzzy well not sure as they seem to be taller in general though it may fit the other characteristics defined for such class So I would venture not Cairns and perhaps Fuzzy or mixed undefined Thanks again for this interesting conversation Once I post my initial findings in collections more will be hopefully clarified and further defined Thanks a lot! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Many thanks for your comments and follow on questions! As to the definition of Cairns the provided golden set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set includes examples where the bright parts reach up to about Hz the lower cutoff at about Hz is determined by the upper edge of the loud but whitened away from sight stationary noise band and the visible durations usually exceed seconds and can reach about seconds The durations reported by Omicron can be even longer sometimes exceeding seconds In this regard I guess we should do as dethodav does not as dethodav says Now having looked at many subjects in the past and having used the glitch plotter on O and earlier subjects imagine what a lower Q rendering would do to such a glitch It is impossible to predict the precise shape the Q transform is a projection it loses information but we can foretell that there'll be somewhat less stretching of the overall shape in the horizontal direction and somewhat more in the vertical direction so the visible durations will tend to be a bit shorter while the vertical extent may then stick out a bit beyond the Hz range the more so the lower the Q value is chosen I haven't yet found convincing examples at Q or but I'm keeping my eyes open I've recently had to deal with all those "fuzzy range" subjects which can get rendered at any old Q so my brain is currently flooded with illustrations of how the rendering choice affects the appearance of an underlying population that's intrinsically uniform with some variability One reason why I said up front that lower Q examples of Cairns must exist is that I had already run into several candidates a few weeks ago including and as by catch during similarity searches based on other kinds of subjects I didn't immediately know what to do with them and didn't yet have a name for them and moreover I was very busy with other things that needed urgent attention Thus for a while these candidates were left sitting in very different corners of my queues not wanting to neatly fit anywhere I'm now digging through all these odd corners and trying to re unite the puzzle pieces that now suddenly seem to belong together It's certainly true that lower Q renderings of cairns are going to look a bit less like their namesakes I'm also having another look at possible "around Hz" non arching glitches from Livingston I may be able to come up with a few more probably not very many though https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thanks again for the follow up and visualizations Succinctly a We extend Cairn to the Hz range and up to about correct?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

These glitches are described by their occurrence predominantly at certain frequencies and are marked by a less defined, "fuzzy" appearance on the spectograms. They are speculated to be associated with environmental or instrumental influences causing broad frequency spectrum disturbances.\n   - URL: [Fuzzy Range Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3401049/)\n\n2. **Cairn Glitches**: This newly identified glitch class is named "Cairn." Described as resembling pyramid-shaped configurations in the spectral plots, these glitches seem to be distinct in their manifestation. Citizen scientists have noted these glitches have a broad frequency response, often appearing in clusters, leading to the metaphorical naming after stone cairns.\n   - URL: [Cairn Glitches Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/)\n\n### Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n\n1. **Confusion over Scattered Light Classification**: In Talk Dataset 2, concerns are raised regarding the classification of scattered light glitches. Citizen scientists discuss potential misclassifications where glitches labeled as scattered light do not exhibit typical characteristics, suggesting a need for refined criteria or additional subclass distinctions within this category.\n   - URL: [Scattered Light Concerns](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/)\n\n### Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science\n\n1. **Questions on Glitch Origins**: Citizen scientists in Talk Dataset 2 express a deeper curiosity about the origins of specific glitches, such as whether certain patterns can be consistently linked to known environmental factors or instrument behaviors. This reflects a growing desire to understand not just the classification but also the causative factors behind observed data anomalies.\n   - URL: [Origin Questioning](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400908/)\n\n2. **Technical Inquiry about Sensors**: There are emerging discussions about the specific sensors or components within the LIGO detectors that might be particularly sensitive or prone to capturing certain glitches. These questions show a more technical engagement with the hardware aspect of gravitational wave detection.\n   - URL: [Sensor Specific Inquiry](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/)\n\n3. **Learning Classifications and Data Analysis**: Questions arise on how to better utilize tools like the Zooniverse platform for classifying and analyzing glitches. This points to a broader educational pursuit among citizen scientists to gain skills in data handling and interpretation relevant to gravitational wave science.\n   - URL: [Learning Classifications](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3403507/)\n\n### Hypotheses on Glitch Origins\n\n1. **Environmental Influences on Glitch Occurrences**: In Talk Dataset 2, there are more nuanced discussions about how environmental conditions such as seismic activities or human-made disturbances might correspond with the timing and characteristics of certain glitches. These hypotheses are motivated by observed correlations between external events and data anomalies, suggesting potential areas for further scientific investigation.\n   - URL: [Environmental Hypotheses](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/)\n\n### Questions Concerning Sensors and Channels\n\n1. **Specific Sensor Concerns**: New discussions in Talk Dataset 2 suggest a growing interest in how particular sensors or channels might influence the frequency and type of glitches detected.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow? I'll be travelling tomorrow and may not be able to follow up further before Friday https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Well spotted! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3398448/ Yes well noted The Livingston engineers are still hunting for the cause They haven't yet used the word "fuzzy" to describe this phenomenon instead calling it " Hz monster" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep or "Big ugly" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ I hope big ugly isn the sensitive type! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ Surely not given what it's been doing to LLO's sensitivity curve ! Let's hope it'll succumb to some serious troubleshooting soon even though that'll deprive us of one prolific source of subjects https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ Hi all! I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch! This belongs here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3314162?comment Note the reported peak frequency Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Right at a reported peak frequency of Hz this would best fit among Hanford's medium frequency ripples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk The Bike Chains tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk live at higher frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ This comes from Hanford's second "fuzzy range" episode on tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3314162?comment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you dethodav for bringing these investigations to our attention! We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled July 26th am Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you dethodav for addressing the questions It is useful to have those defining features for the Cairn class Please note that the collection Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set is still inaccessible yielding the same error message as mentioned before Edit it works now thanks!

Some further questions and remarks So I gather the point is to teach the ML about glitches that it should not label as Scattered Light but currently does while also making sure that it will still recognize subjects that are instances of "traditional" Scattered Light Will you be able to train the ML on collections of "mere" counterexamples penalizing it for misclassifications without assigning a specific other "good" class to each "this isn't Scattered Light" subject? I understand that this hasn't been possible in the past If this still isn't possible then we need to be more careful about the training sets we're going to build They should not just collect other than Scattered Light subjects but each of them should collect subjects that really belong together into a different class They should focus on core rather than fringe examples of these different classes And they should capture the essence of each of these other classes In particular they shouldn't be limited to subjects rendered at Q only when the other class under consideration has been attracting renderings at other Q values in signficant numbers I'm hopeful that Cairn will turn out to be a good if not very populous class grouping glitches together that share a common origin As far as I can see so far it will have to include examples rendered at lower Q values and it is mostly a Livingston thing "Similar" looking subjects from Hanford are numerous but are invariably something else most Scattered Light from Hanford O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3013446?comment O4b looks somewhat cairn ish except for the Q "wheatgrass" renderings On the other hand I'm sceptical about the Hz subjects The three initial gold examples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set may turn out to be three different things spanning a range of peak frequencies as reported by Omicron and one of them visibly sloping I don't think they are tied to any specific fixed frequency features spectral lines Livingston has had a few ! glitches specifically at Hz about a year ago see LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep tab is one of these that has got labeled Scattered Light with not very high confidence but others like tab got more plausibly filed under Low Frequency Lines I'm not aware of any more recent fixed frequency glitch sources at Livingston in the Hz ballpark From Hanford we have firstly the medium frequency ripples and combs tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk showing up around and and and Hz the ones peaking near Hz have occasionally received Scattered Light labels g tab but more often Low Frequency Lines tab or No Glitch tab and secondly the Hz floor motion coupling tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches could last up to several minutes at a time and often got whitened out so thoroughly that the image producing part of Gravity Spy picked a Q value at random and left us and the ML with nothing to see These subjects are still recognizable by their peak frequencies and durations but hopeless to classify purely by the resulting images tab is a rare example rendered at Q that has attracted a Scattered Light label Here too Low Frequency Lines and No Glitch occur more often Both of these glitch class proposals already link to relevant collections But the many "NotNoGlitch" examples won't do much good in training a purely image based ML They would require a more sophisticated ML which also pays attention to the Omicron metadata peak frequency duration and SNR and perhaps one which receives renderings at all four Q values as its image input not just at a single choice which may or may not match the given glitch very well I can't help noticing that all the current members of the Traditional Scattering Gold Set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with one possible exception are marginal cases of Livingston's Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk marginal in the sense that the ground was moving at somewhat less than Hz and the penduluming item excited below its resonance was able to follow the ground motion so the arches we see are spaced more than seconds apart and all of them are Q renderings The glitch subclass proposal already links to a more representative candidate training set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant training set l a dot hz scattering from O4a These glitches have not changed much between O4a and O4b But apropos of this another question springs to mind Many of these Hz scattering glitches stay below the Hz band of loud stationary noise and thus do less harm to clean observing time than those which do show up loudly above Hz As long as we're aiming to classify by common causes and common coupling paths they all belong together Nevertheless would it make sense to maintain a distinction between very low frequency Scattered Light peak frequency below Hz and the more harmful sort peak above Hz ?

Yes the LIGO observatories have been changing a bit faster over the years than our Gravity Spy classification scheme During the ongoing fourth observing run after three years of upgrades they are throwing an unprecedented mix of new glitches at us and at their engineers We're still in the middle of sorting out what's what and trying to figure out how to improve the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component to deal with the new realities You'll meet quite a lot of "None Of The Above" subjects as you advance through the workflows The splendid multi arch Scattered Light glitches as illustrated in the Field Guide were in fact root caused already in late and fixed in January before the end of the third observing run O Scattered Light still causes numerous glitches nowadays but many of them now have their main arches below Hz where we can't see them or as in this case between and Hz with mere fragments of additional arches above Hz The Machine Learning tends to think of these as Low Frequency Burst Personally I've been classifying them as Scattered Light anyway going by how they are caused But it could also be argued that perhaps we should stick with Low Frequency Burst when the obvious noise is confined below Hz where it does less harm and reserve the Scattered Light class for arches protruding well above Hz You'll meet some of those too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/ Update I've managed to load another subject it seems like the not loading is just a side effect and not the main cause Would it be possible for you to check what levels my account has unlocked? If my account has reverted back to level the program may at some point expect me to have at least levels unlocked and is frozen because of this this would make more sense because the workflow pop up shown now is never shown otherwise because the tutorial takes priority https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Update on the occasion the assignment has loaded in the background removing the div with the class "StyledLayer sc rmtehz cULqQv" will let me solve and submit an answer! The issue of unlocked levels has however not been solved https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ OK thank you! The sentry io stuff is unrelated but the StyledLayer sc rmtehz division the last six characters will vary contains the modal "Choose a workflow" popup I conclude from this that some event isn't happening that in the normal course of things ought to dismiss the popup and give way to the Classifier This still leaves a number of possibilities what should have happened in the background includes a Zooniverse API call to load workflow number a request to fetch the workflow's json file with various content details fetching a number of JavaScript resources providing classification related functionality fetching the subject images themselves along with the little thumbnail images for the classifier buttons as well as fetching the project preferences JSON object for the current account and project combination from the API NB I'm not familiar with all the implementation details and I can't check anything on the server side myself moderator privileges extend only to the Talk pages Researcher Kevin crowston has been looking into the matter from the server angle thank you! Perhaps a comparison with the Black Hole Hunters tab projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters project which like Gravity Spy uses the new Zooniverse UI frontend may yield some useful further data But the workflow promotion machinery is specific to Gravity Spy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9szGhaFKNxKHEBxWmat46Ntiuj1KQ', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='1. **New Glitch Classes in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Fuzzy Range Blip**: A novel glitch category mentioned in Talk Dataset 2 is the "fuzzy range blip". This glitch is described as confined in time and frequency range, suggesting a more localized disturbance in the sensor data compared to broader categories. This might indicate a less distributed source or a more contained event affecting the sensor. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/)\n   - **Low-Frequency Line**: Another potential new classification is the "low-frequency line". It appears to be a distinct type from previously recognized patterns, possibly indicating a continuous or periodic source of noise at lower frequencies, distinct from more transient or high-frequency glitch types. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406236/)\n\n2. **Concerns About Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is an expressed concern about the "Scattered Light" classification. The comment suggests that many glitches currently categorized under this class might be mistakenly grouped, indicating a potential overgeneralization in this category. This reflects a need to refine the definitions or perhaps sub-categorize this class to enhance classification accuracy. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/)\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - Citizens in Talk Dataset 2 are showing an initiative to understand the impact of glitches across different sensors and their operational statuses. There are specific inquiries about whether certain glitches like "fuzzy range" are common to specific LIGO sites or if they manifest differently depending on the site. This questioning helps deepen understanding of how localized environmental factors or sensor-specific issues influence data readings. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404617/)\n   - Another emerging question involves the technical aspects of data handling and glitch categorization processes. Participants are curious about how machine learning tools categorize and differentiate between glitch types, reflecting a deeper dive into the analytical methodologies behind the citizen science project. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/)\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - A hypothesis discussed involves the potential origins of the "fuzzy range" glitches being linked to specific equipment malfunctions or configuration settings, such as in the squeezer subsystem at LIGO Livingston. This hypothesis is analytically motivated by temporal correlations between equipment adjustments and the emergence of certain glitch patterns, suggesting a direct cause-and-effect relationship. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404617/)\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a discussion regarding the specific channels and sensors responsible for certain glitches. There are questions about whether the "fuzzy range" glitches are specifically related to the squeezer subsystem and how these glitches might be mitigated or prevented by hardware adjustments. This reflects an advanced level of inquiry into the hardware-software interaction within the gravitational wave detection infrastructure. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404617/)\n   - Additionally, there is a query about whether glitches that appear similar across different sensors are actually the same or if they are similar but distinct phenomena. This kind of questioning can lead to a better understanding of the systemic versus localized nature of glitches in the detection system.

User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow? I'll be travelling tomorrow and may not be able to follow up further before Friday https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Well spotted! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3398448/ Yes well noted The Livingston engineers are still hunting for the cause They haven't yet used the word "fuzzy" to describe this phenomenon instead calling it " Hz monster" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep or "Big ugly" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ I hope big ugly isn the sensitive type! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ Surely not given what it's been doing to LLO's sensitivity curve !

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread! Edit fixed link to "Traditional scattered light glitches" https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ wanderingline https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399460/ Seems to be a 70hz line ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Hi Thank you for responding to my questions I have been doing classifications on Zooniverse since on my iPad and on my MacBook Pro including classifications on Gravity Spy I have tried both Safari and Chrome and the problem is identical on both browsers I have been successful in my classifications on the Einstein Pulsar Project on my devices and on both browsers When I click on Classify the pop up menu appears with one unlocked work flow When I click on that workflow it will not fully load and open to allow me to do the classifications It just stays stuck closed with a partial load bar showing Signing out then resigning in also does not solve the problem I hope you can help me as I really like this project Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ 30hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ excessive phenomena too long for fireballs maybe a flag projects zooniverse gravity spy talk tags flag ??? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399699/ Doesn't seem to fit in the power line glitch due to the length of the glitches Some harmonics or ripples Maybe a bikechain type? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399710/ chirp https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/155207/ Diffraction grating with repeating blips though maybe wheatgrass or tufts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399778/ Thank you for the additional information! Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled July 26th am Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you dethodav for addressing the questions It is useful to have those defining features for the Cairn class Please note that the collection Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set is still inaccessible yielding the same error message as mentioned before Edit it works now thanks!

Some further questions and remarks So I gather the point is to teach the ML about glitches that it should not label as Scattered Light but currently does while also making sure that it will still recognize subjects that are instances of "traditional" Scattered Light Will you be able to train the ML on collections of "mere" counterexamples penalizing it for misclassifications without assigning a specific other "good" class to each "this isn't Scattered Light" subject? I understand that this hasn't been possible in the past If this still isn't possible then we need to be more careful about the training sets we're going to build They should not just collect other than Scattered Light subjects but each of them should collect subjects that really belong together into a different class They should focus on core rather than fringe examples of these different classes And they should capture the essence of each of these other classes In particular they shouldn't be limited to subjects rendered at Q only when the other class under consideration has been attracting renderings at other Q values in signficant numbers I'm hopeful that Cairn will turn out to be a good if not very populous class grouping glitches together that share a common origin As far as I can see so far it will have to include examples rendered at lower Q values and it is mostly a Livingston thing "Similar" looking subjects from Hanford are numerous but are invariably something else most Scattered Light from Hanford O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3013446?comment O4b looks somewhat cairn ish except for the Q "wheatgrass" renderings On the other hand I'm sceptical about the Hz subjects The three initial gold examples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set may turn out to be three different things spanning a range of peak frequencies as reported by Omicron and one of them visibly sloping I don't think they are tied to any specific fixed frequency features spectral lines Livingston has had a few ! glitches specifically at Hz about a year ago see LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep tab is one of these that has got labeled Scattered Light with not very high confidence but others like tab got more plausibly filed under Low Frequency Lines I'm not aware of any more recent fixed frequency glitch sources at Livingston in the Hz ballpark From Hanford we have firstly the medium frequency ripples and combs tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk showing up around and and and Hz the ones peaking near Hz have occasionally received Scattered Light labels g tab but more often Low Frequency Lines tab or No Glitch tab and secondly the Hz floor motion coupling tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches could last up to several minutes at a time and often got whitened out so thoroughly that the image producing part of Gravity Spy picked a Q value at random and left us and the ML with nothing to see These subjects are still recognizable by their peak frequencies and durations but hopeless to classify purely by the resulting images tab is a rare example rendered at Q that has attracted a Scattered Light label Here too Low Frequency Lines and No Glitch occur more often Both of these glitch class proposals already link to relevant collections But the many "NotNoGlitch" examples won't do much good in training a purely image based ML They would require a more sophisticated ML which also pays attention to the Omicron metadata peak frequency duration and SNR and perhaps one which receives renderings at all four Q values as its image input not just at a single choice which may or may not match the given glitch very well I can't help noticing that all the current members of the Traditional Scattering Gold Set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with one possible exception are marginal cases of Livingston's Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk marginal in the sense that the ground was moving at somewhat less than Hz and the penduluming item excited below its resonance was able to follow the ground motion so the arches we see are spaced more than seconds apart and all of them are Q renderings The glitch subclass proposal already links to a more representative candidate training set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant training set l a dot hz scattering from O4a These glitches have not changed much between O4a and O4b But apropos of this another question springs to mind Many of these Hz scattering glitches stay below the Hz band of loud stationary noise and thus do less harm to clean observing time than those which do show up loudly above Hz As long as we're aiming to classify by common causes and common coupling paths they all belong together Nevertheless would it make sense to maintain a distinction between very low frequency Scattered Light peak frequency below Hz and the more harmful sort peak above Hz ?

Yes the LIGO observatories have been changing a bit faster over the years than our Gravity Spy classification scheme During the ongoing fourth observing run after three years of upgrades they are throwing an unprecedented mix of new glitches at us and at their engineers We're still in the middle of sorting out what's what and trying to figure out how to improve the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component to deal with the new realities You'll meet quite a lot of "None Of The Above" subjects as you advance through the workflows The splendid multi arch Scattered Light glitches as illustrated in the Field Guide were in fact root caused already in late and fixed in January before the end of the third observing run O Scattered Light still causes numerous glitches nowadays but many of them now have their main arches below Hz where we can't see them or as in this case between and Hz with mere fragments of additional arches above Hz The Machine Learning tends to think of these as Low Frequency Burst Personally I've been classifying them as Scattered Light anyway going by how they are caused But it could also be argued that perhaps we should stick with Low Frequency Burst when the obvious noise is confined below Hz where it does less harm and reserve the Scattered Light class for arches protruding well above Hz You'll meet some of those too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/ Update I've managed to load another subject it seems like the not loading is just a side effect and not the main cause Would it be possible for you to check what levels my account has unlocked? If my account has reverted back to level the program may at some point expect me to have at least levels unlocked and is frozen because of this this would make more sense because the workflow pop up shown now is never shown otherwise because the tutorial takes priority https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Update on the occasion the assignment has loaded in the background removing the div with the class "StyledLayer sc rmtehz cULqQv" will let me solve and submit an answer! The issue of unlocked levels has however not been solved https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ OK thank you! The sentry io stuff is unrelated but the StyledLayer sc rmtehz division the last six characters will vary contains the modal "Choose a workflow" popup I conclude from this that some event isn't happening that in the normal course of things ought to dismiss the popup and give way to the Classifier This still leaves a number of possibilities what should have happened in the background includes a Zooniverse API call to load workflow number a request to fetch the workflow's json file with various content details fetching a number of JavaScript resources providing classification related functionality fetching the subject images themselves along with the little thumbnail images for the classifier buttons as well as fetching the project preferences JSON object for the current account and project combination from the API NB I'm not familiar with all the implementation details and I can't check anything on the server side myself moderator privileges extend only to the Talk pages Researcher Kevin crowston has been looking into the matter from the server angle thank you! Perhaps a comparison with the Black Hole Hunters tab projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters project which like Gravity Spy uses the new Zooniverse UI frontend may yield some useful further data But the workflow promotion machinery is specific to Gravity Spy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The discussions involve trying to understand if this class shares characteristics with other known glitches or if it stands alone. The description often includes its fuzzy appearance in the frequency domain, suggesting a less defined and more dispersed signal. URLs: [Fuzzy Range Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396767/), [Fuzzy Range Continued](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/).\n\n2. **Concerns About Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are discussions about whether some glitches classified under one category should be reclassified. For instance, there are debates on the classification of "Scattered Light" glitches, where some participants argue that certain glitches showing characteristics of "Scattered Light" are being miscategorized, possibly affecting the accuracy of the machine learning model used in classifications. This concern highlights the need for reevaluation of the classifications to improve identification accuracy. URLs: [Scattered Light Concern](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/).\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - Participants are exploring deeper into the specific characteristics of glitches like the "Fuzzy Range" and questioning how these may impact the sensitivity of LIGO\'s observations. They discuss the potential implications of misclassifications on the understanding of gravitational waves and the accuracy of data used in scientific research. These discussions are vital as they contribute to refining the classification algorithms and enhancing the quality of scientific output. URLs: [Technical Aspects Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/).\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - A specific hypothesis discussed involves the "Fuzzy Range" glitches possibly originating from input beam jitter or issues within the squeezer subsystem, which suggests a mechanical or operational origin. This hypothesis is based on observations correlating the appearance of these glitches with particular hardware operations or environmental conditions at the LIGO facilities. The analytical motivation here is to link operational parameters of LIGO instruments with observed data anomalies, aiming to isolate and rectify sources of noise. URLs: [Beam Jitter Hypothesis](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404366/), [Squeezer Subsystem Hypothesis](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404617/).\n\n5. **Sensor or Channel-Specific Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Discussions in Dataset 2 include queries about whether certain glitches like the "Fuzzy Range" are specific to certain channels or sensors at the Livingston or Hanford detectors. These questions are crucial as they help to pinpoint the exact source or location within the detectors where anomalies are occurring, potentially leading to more targeted troubleshooting and calibration efforts.

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread!

Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled July 26th am Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you dethodav for addressing the questions It is useful to have those defining features for the Cairn class Please note that the collection Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set is still inaccessible yielding the same error message as mentioned before Edit it works now thanks!

Some further questions and remarks So I gather the point is to teach the ML about glitches that it should not label as Scattered Light but currently does while also making sure that it will still recognize subjects that are instances of "traditional" Scattered Light Will you be able to train the ML on collections of "mere" counterexamples penalizing it for misclassifications without assigning a specific other "good" class to each "this isn't Scattered Light" subject? I understand that this hasn't been possible in the past If this still isn't possible then we need to be more careful about the training sets we're going to build They should not just collect other than Scattered Light subjects but each of them should collect subjects that really belong together into a different class They should focus on core rather than fringe examples of these different classes And they should capture the essence of each of these other classes In particular they shouldn't be limited to subjects rendered at Q only when the other class under consideration has been attracting renderings at other Q values in signficant numbers I'm hopeful that Cairn will turn out to be a good if not very populous class grouping glitches together that share a common origin As far as I can see so far it will have to include examples rendered at lower Q values and it is mostly a Livingston thing "Similar" looking subjects from Hanford are numerous but are invariably something else most Scattered Light from Hanford O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3013446?comment O4b looks somewhat cairn ish except for the Q "wheatgrass" renderings On the other hand I'm sceptical about the Hz subjects The three initial gold examples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set may turn out to be three different things spanning a range of peak frequencies as reported by Omicron and one of them visibly sloping I don't think they are tied to any specific fixed frequency features spectral lines Livingston has had a few ! glitches specifically at Hz about a year ago see LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep tab is one of these that has got labeled Scattered Light with not very high confidence but others like tab got more plausibly filed under Low Frequency Lines I'm not aware of any more recent fixed frequency glitch sources at Livingston in the Hz ballpark From Hanford we have firstly the medium frequency ripples and combs tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk showing up around and and and Hz the ones peaking near Hz have occasionally received Scattered Light labels g tab but more often Low Frequency Lines tab or No Glitch tab and secondly the Hz floor motion coupling tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches could last up to several minutes at a time and often got whitened out so thoroughly that the image producing part of Gravity Spy picked a Q value at random and left us and the ML with nothing to see These subjects are still recognizable by their peak frequencies and durations but hopeless to classify purely by the resulting images tab is a rare example rendered at Q that has attracted a Scattered Light label Here too Low Frequency Lines and No Glitch occur more often Both of these glitch class proposals already link to relevant collections But the many "NotNoGlitch" examples won't do much good in training a purely image based ML They would require a more sophisticated ML which also pays attention to the Omicron metadata peak frequency duration and SNR and perhaps one which receives renderings at all four Q values as its image input not just at a single choice which may or may not match the given glitch very well I can't help noticing that all the current members of the Traditional Scattering Gold Set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with one possible exception are marginal cases of Livingston's Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk marginal in the sense that the ground was moving at somewhat less than Hz and the penduluming item excited below its resonance was able to follow the ground motion so the arches we see are spaced more than seconds apart and all of them are Q renderings The glitch subclass proposal already links to a more representative candidate training set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant training set l a dot hz scattering from O4a These glitches have not changed much between O4a and O4b But apropos of this another question springs to mind Many of these Hz scattering glitches stay below the Hz band of loud stationary noise and thus do less harm to clean observing time than those which do show up loudly above Hz As long as we're aiming to classify by common causes and common coupling paths they all belong together Nevertheless would it make sense to maintain a distinction between very low frequency Scattered Light peak frequency below Hz and the more harmful sort peak above Hz ?

Yes the LIGO observatories have been changing a bit faster over the years than our Gravity Spy classification scheme During the ongoing fourth observing run after three years of upgrades they are throwing an unprecedented mix of new glitches at us and at their engineers We're still in the middle of sorting out what's what and trying to figure out how to improve the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component to deal with the new realities You'll meet quite a lot of "None Of The Above" subjects as you advance through the workflows The splendid multi arch Scattered Light glitches as illustrated in the Field Guide were in fact root caused already in late and fixed in January before the end of the third observing run O Scattered Light still causes numerous glitches nowadays but many of them now have their main arches below Hz where we can't see them or as in this case between and Hz with mere fragments of additional arches above Hz The Machine Learning tends to think of these as Low Frequency Burst Personally I've been classifying them as Scattered Light anyway going by how they are caused But it could also be argued that perhaps we should stick with Low Frequency Burst when the obvious noise is confined below Hz where it does less harm and reserve the Scattered Light class for arches protruding well above Hz You'll meet some of those too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/ Update I've managed to load another subject it seems like the not loading is just a side effect and not the main cause Would it be possible for you to check what levels my account has unlocked? If my account has reverted back to level the program may at some point expect me to have at least levels unlocked and is frozen because of this this would make more sense because the workflow pop up shown now is never shown otherwise because the tutorial takes priority https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Update on the occasion the assignment has loaded in the background removing the div with the class "StyledLayer sc rmtehz cULqQv" will let me solve and submit an answer! The issue of unlocked levels has however not been solved https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ OK thank you! The sentry io stuff is unrelated but the StyledLayer sc rmtehz division the last six characters will vary contains the modal "Choose a workflow" popup I conclude from this that some event isn't happening that in the normal course of things ought to dismiss the popup and give way to the Classifier This still leaves a number of possibilities what should have happened in the background includes a Zooniverse API call to load workflow number a request to fetch the workflow's json file with various content details fetching a number of JavaScript resources providing classification related functionality fetching the subject images themselves along with the little thumbnail images for the classifier buttons as well as fetching the project preferences JSON object for the current account and project combination from the API NB I'm not familiar with all the implementation details and I can't check anything on the server side myself moderator privileges extend only to the Talk pages Researcher Kevin crowston has been looking into the matter from the server angle thank you! Perhaps a comparison with the Black Hole Hunters tab projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters project which like Gravity Spy uses the new Zooniverse UI frontend may yield some useful further data But the workflow promotion machinery is specific to Gravity Spy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

This class is described as confined in both time and frequency range, indicating a more localized spectral disturbance compared to broader categories like "fuzzy range." This classification highlights a nuanced observation of glitches that appear more transient and localized.\n   - URL reference: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/\n\n### Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n\n1. **Scattered Light Concerns**: In Talk Dataset 2, there are concerns about the classification of "Scattered Light." Citizen scientists discuss whether certain observations classified under "Scattered Light" should instead be categorized as "Low Frequency Burst" due to their confinement below certain frequency thresholds. This reflects a nuanced understanding and questioning of how glitch categories are defined based on their spectral characteristics.\n   - URL reference: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/\n\n### Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects\n\n1. **Workflow and Classification Levels**: In Talk Dataset 2, there are emerging questions about accessing certain levels of classification in the Zooniverse project interface. This technical aspect relates to understanding how different levels of the platform provide access to varying complexities of glitch classifications. Users experience difficulties in accessing higher levels, which impedes their learning and contribution to more advanced glitch categorization.\n   - URL reference: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/\n\n### Hypotheses About Glitch Origins\n\n1. **Input Beam Jitter**: A specific hypothesis discussed in Talk Dataset 2 about the origin of certain glitches is related to "input beam jitter." This hypothesis suggests that tiny wobbles in the laser beam\'s entry point into vacuum vessels could be causing observable noise across several medium frequencies. The analytical motivation for this hypothesis is derived from observing patterns of glitches that follow the onset of these minor disturbances.\n   - URL reference: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/\n\n### Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels\n\n1. **Specific Sensors and Error Sources**: In Talk Dataset 2, there is a detailed discussion about the potential for specific equipment such as cables and their connections at LIGO Livingston to affect the data quality, leading to glitches. This discussion shows a deepening understanding of how physical configurations and minor changes in the experimental setup (like cable connections) could lead to significant data disturbances.\n   - URL reference: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404617/\n\nThese insights from Talk Dataset 2 indicate a progression in the community\'s engagement and sophistication in discussing and hypothesizing about glitches, their origins, and the technical aspects of the classification system.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1722999101, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_c77e07d4ef', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=622, prompt_tokens=13399, total_tokens=14021))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow? I'll be travelling tomorrow and may not be able to follow up further before Friday https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Well spotted! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3398448/ Yes well noted The Livingston engineers are still hunting for the cause They haven't yet used the word "fuzzy" to describe this phenomenon instead calling it " Hz monster" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep or "Big ugly" LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ I hope big ugly isn the sensitive type! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399055/ Surely not given what it's been doing to LLO's sensitivity curve !

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread!

Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled July 26th am Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you dethodav for addressing the questions It is useful to have those defining features for the Cairn class Please note that the collection Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set is still inaccessible yielding the same error message as mentioned before Edit it works now thanks!

Some further questions and remarks So I gather the point is to teach the ML about glitches that it should not label as Scattered Light but currently does while also making sure that it will still recognize subjects that are instances of "traditional" Scattered Light Will you be able to train the ML on collections of "mere" counterexamples penalizing it for misclassifications without assigning a specific other "good" class to each "this isn't Scattered Light" subject? I understand that this hasn't been possible in the past If this still isn't possible then we need to be more careful about the training sets we're going to build They should not just collect other than Scattered Light subjects but each of them should collect subjects that really belong together into a different class They should focus on core rather than fringe examples of these different classes And they should capture the essence of each of these other classes In particular they shouldn't be limited to subjects rendered at Q only when the other class under consideration has been attracting renderings at other Q values in signficant numbers I'm hopeful that Cairn will turn out to be a good if not very populous class grouping glitches together that share a common origin As far as I can see so far it will have to include examples rendered at lower Q values and it is mostly a Livingston thing "Similar" looking subjects from Hanford are numerous but are invariably something else most Scattered Light from Hanford O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3013446?comment O4b looks somewhat cairn ish except for the Q "wheatgrass" renderings On the other hand I'm sceptical about the Hz subjects The three initial gold examples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set may turn out to be three different things spanning a range of peak frequencies as reported by Omicron and one of them visibly sloping I don't think they are tied to any specific fixed frequency features spectral lines Livingston has had a few ! glitches specifically at Hz about a year ago see LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep tab is one of these that has got labeled Scattered Light with not very high confidence but others like tab got more plausibly filed under Low Frequency Lines I'm not aware of any more recent fixed frequency glitch sources at Livingston in the Hz ballpark From Hanford we have firstly the medium frequency ripples and combs tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk showing up around and and and Hz the ones peaking near Hz have occasionally received Scattered Light labels g tab but more often Low Frequency Lines tab or No Glitch tab and secondly the Hz floor motion coupling tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches could last up to several minutes at a time and often got whitened out so thoroughly that the image producing part of Gravity Spy picked a Q value at random and left us and the ML with nothing to see These subjects are still recognizable by their peak frequencies and durations but hopeless to classify purely by the resulting images tab is a rare example rendered at Q that has attracted a Scattered Light label Here too Low Frequency Lines and No Glitch occur more often Both of these glitch class proposals already link to relevant collections But the many "NotNoGlitch" examples won't do much good in training a purely image based ML They would require a more sophisticated ML which also pays attention to the Omicron metadata peak frequency duration and SNR and perhaps one which receives renderings at all four Q values as its image input not just at a single choice which may or may not match the given glitch very well I can't help noticing that all the current members of the Traditional Scattering Gold Set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with one possible exception are marginal cases of Livingston's Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk marginal in the sense that the ground was moving at somewhat less than Hz and the penduluming item excited below its resonance was able to follow the ground motion so the arches we see are spaced more than seconds apart and all of them are Q renderings The glitch subclass proposal already links to a more representative candidate training set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant training set l a dot hz scattering from O4a These glitches have not changed much between O4a and O4b But apropos of this another question springs to mind Many of these Hz scattering glitches stay below the Hz band of loud stationary noise and thus do less harm to clean observing time than those which do show up loudly above Hz As long as we're aiming to classify by common causes and common coupling paths they all belong together Nevertheless would it make sense to maintain a distinction between very low frequency Scattered Light peak frequency below Hz and the more harmful sort peak above Hz ?

Yes the LIGO observatories have been changing a bit faster over the years than our Gravity Spy classification scheme During the ongoing fourth observing run after three years of upgrades they are throwing an unprecedented mix of new glitches at us and at their engineers We're still in the middle of sorting out what's what and trying to figure out how to improve the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component to deal with the new realities You'll meet quite a lot of "None Of The Above" subjects as you advance through the workflows The splendid multi arch Scattered Light glitches as illustrated in the Field Guide were in fact root caused already in late and fixed in January before the end of the third observing run O Scattered Light still causes numerous glitches nowadays but many of them now have their main arches below Hz where we can't see them or as in this case between and Hz with mere fragments of additional arches above Hz The Machine Learning tends to think of these as Low Frequency Burst Personally I've been classifying them as Scattered Light anyway going by how they are caused But it could also be argued that perhaps we should stick with Low Frequency Burst when the obvious noise is confined below Hz where it does less harm and reserve the Scattered Light class for arches protruding well above Hz You'll meet some of those too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/ Update I've managed to load another subject it seems like the not loading is just a side effect and not the main cause Would it be possible for you to check what levels my account has unlocked? If my account has reverted back to level the program may at some point expect me to have at least levels unlocked and is frozen because of this this would make more sense because the workflow pop up shown now is never shown otherwise because the tutorial takes priority https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Update on the occasion the assignment has loaded in the background removing the div with the class "StyledLayer sc rmtehz cULqQv" will let me solve and submit an answer! The issue of unlocked levels has however not been solved https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ OK thank you! The sentry io stuff is unrelated but the StyledLayer sc rmtehz division the last six characters will vary contains the modal "Choose a workflow" popup I conclude from this that some event isn't happening that in the normal course of things ought to dismiss the popup and give way to the Classifier This still leaves a number of possibilities what should have happened in the background includes a Zooniverse API call to load workflow number a request to fetch the workflow's json file with various content details fetching a number of JavaScript resources providing classification related functionality fetching the subject images themselves along with the little thumbnail images for the classifier buttons as well as fetching the project preferences JSON object for the current account and project combination from the API NB I'm not familiar with all the implementation details and I can't check anything on the server side myself moderator privileges extend only to the Talk pages Researcher Kevin crowston has been looking into the matter from the server angle thank you! Perhaps a comparison with the Black Hole Hunters tab projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters project which like Gravity Spy uses the new Zooniverse UI frontend may yield some useful further data But the workflow promotion machinery is specific to Gravity Spy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9tR64aRj8Qv6s1wsy1dj7yrfZmXnv', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='1. **Proposed New Glitch Classes in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, a notable mention is a glitch type described as "fuzzy range." While similar mentions appear in Dataset 1, the specific characterization and focus on this type as a distinct class seem more pronounced in Dataset 2. This class is described in various scenarios where the glitch appears confined in time and frequency, suggesting a distinct pattern or behavior that differs from more widely recognized classes. This particular focus may indicate an observation of a new or previously under-recognized glitch phenomenon.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - There is a concern in Talk Dataset 2 about the classification of "Scattered Light." A user narrates their personal classification strategy, debating between categorizing certain data as "Low Frequency Burst" versus "Scattered Light," based on the frequency and visibility of arches. This indicates a potential ambiguity in class definitions, where the same data could reasonably fit into multiple existing classes depending on the interpretation of visible characteristics.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Science:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there\'s an emergent curiosity about the effectiveness of the current classification scheme in the face of new glitch types discovered during the fourth observing run. Questions arise about how to improve the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component to adapt to new glitches. This reflects a deeper engagement with the process of classification and an interest in the evolving nature of gravitational wave science.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - A specific hypothesis mentioned in Talk Dataset 2 concerns glitches attributed to "input beam jitter," describing small wobbles in the laser beam\'s direction where it enters the vacuum chambers. This suggestion is analytically motivated by the observation of glitches characterized by initial jolts followed by medium-frequency reverberations, pointing to mechanical resonances as a cause.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are specific references to problems experienced by users on the Zooniverse platform that may affect the classification process, such as issues with unlocking workflows or pages not loading. While not directly about sensors or channels, these platform issues could indirectly affect the observation and classification of glitches due to restricted access to data or tools, highlighting concerns about the technical infrastructure supporting glitch analysis.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/\n\nEach of these points demonstrates the active engagement and evolving understanding of citizen scientists in the field of gravitational wave research through the Zooniverse project platform.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1722999228, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_c77e07d4ef', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=654, prompt_tokens=13399, total_tokens=14053))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread!

Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled July 26th am Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you dethodav for addressing the questions It is useful to have those defining features for the Cairn class Please note that the collection Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set is still inaccessible yielding the same error message as mentioned before Edit it works now thanks!

Some further questions and remarks So I gather the point is to teach the ML about glitches that it should not label as Scattered Light but currently does while also making sure that it will still recognize subjects that are instances of "traditional" Scattered Light Will you be able to train the ML on collections of "mere" counterexamples penalizing it for misclassifications without assigning a specific other "good" class to each "this isn't Scattered Light" subject? I understand that this hasn't been possible in the past If this still isn't possible then we need to be more careful about the training sets we're going to build They should not just collect other than Scattered Light subjects but each of them should collect subjects that really belong together into a different class They should focus on core rather than fringe examples of these different classes And they should capture the essence of each of these other classes In particular they shouldn't be limited to subjects rendered at Q only when the other class under consideration has been attracting renderings at other Q values in signficant numbers I'm hopeful that Cairn will turn out to be a good if not very populous class grouping glitches together that share a common origin As far as I can see so far it will have to include examples rendered at lower Q values and it is mostly a Livingston thing "Similar" looking subjects from Hanford are numerous but are invariably something else most Scattered Light from Hanford O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3013446?comment O4b looks somewhat cairn ish except for the Q "wheatgrass" renderings On the other hand I'm sceptical about the Hz subjects The three initial gold examples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set may turn out to be three different things spanning a range of peak frequencies as reported by Omicron and one of them visibly sloping I don't think they are tied to any specific fixed frequency features spectral lines Livingston has had a few ! glitches specifically at Hz about a year ago see LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep tab is one of these that has got labeled Scattered Light with not very high confidence but others like tab got more plausibly filed under Low Frequency Lines I'm not aware of any more recent fixed frequency glitch sources at Livingston in the Hz ballpark From Hanford we have firstly the medium frequency ripples and combs tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk showing up around and and and Hz the ones peaking near Hz have occasionally received Scattered Light labels g tab but more often Low Frequency Lines tab or No Glitch tab and secondly the Hz floor motion coupling tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches could last up to several minutes at a time and often got whitened out so thoroughly that the image producing part of Gravity Spy picked a Q value at random and left us and the ML with nothing to see These subjects are still recognizable by their peak frequencies and durations but hopeless to classify purely by the resulting images tab is a rare example rendered at Q that has attracted a Scattered Light label Here too Low Frequency Lines and No Glitch occur more often Both of these glitch class proposals already link to relevant collections But the many "NotNoGlitch" examples won't do much good in training a purely image based ML They would require a more sophisticated ML which also pays attention to the Omicron metadata peak frequency duration and SNR and perhaps one which receives renderings at all four Q values as its image input not just at a single choice which may or may not match the given glitch very well I can't help noticing that all the current members of the Traditional Scattering Gold Set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with one possible exception are marginal cases of Livingston's Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk marginal in the sense that the ground was moving at somewhat less than Hz and the penduluming item excited below its resonance was able to follow the ground motion so the arches we see are spaced more than seconds apart and all of them are Q renderings The glitch subclass proposal already links to a more representative candidate training set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant training set l a dot hz scattering from O4a These glitches have not changed much between O4a and O4b But apropos of this another question springs to mind Many of these Hz scattering glitches stay below the Hz band of loud stationary noise and thus do less harm to clean observing time than those which do show up loudly above Hz As long as we're aiming to classify by common causes and common coupling paths they all belong together Nevertheless would it make sense to maintain a distinction between very low frequency Scattered Light peak frequency below Hz and the more harmful sort peak above Hz ?

Yes the LIGO observatories have been changing a bit faster over the years than our Gravity Spy classification scheme During the ongoing fourth observing run after three years of upgrades they are throwing an unprecedented mix of new glitches at us and at their engineers We're still in the middle of sorting out what's what and trying to figure out how to improve the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component to deal with the new realities You'll meet quite a lot of "None Of The Above" subjects as you advance through the workflows The splendid multi arch Scattered Light glitches as illustrated in the Field Guide were in fact root caused already in late and fixed in January before the end of the third observing run O Scattered Light still causes numerous glitches nowadays but many of them now have their main arches below Hz where we can't see them or as in this case between and Hz with mere fragments of additional arches above Hz The Machine Learning tends to think of these as Low Frequency Burst Personally I've been classifying them as Scattered Light anyway going by how they are caused But it could also be argued that perhaps we should stick with Low Frequency Burst when the obvious noise is confined below Hz where it does less harm and reserve the Scattered Light class for arches protruding well above Hz You'll meet some of those too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/ Update I've managed to load another subject it seems like the not loading is just a side effect and not the main cause Would it be possible for you to check what levels my account has unlocked? If my account has reverted back to level the program may at some point expect me to have at least levels unlocked and is frozen because of this this would make more sense because the workflow pop up shown now is never shown otherwise because the tutorial takes priority https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Update on the occasion the assignment has loaded in the background removing the div with the class "StyledLayer sc rmtehz cULqQv" will let me solve and submit an answer! The issue of unlocked levels has however not been solved https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ OK thank you! The sentry io stuff is unrelated but the StyledLayer sc rmtehz division the last six characters will vary contains the modal "Choose a workflow" popup I conclude from this that some event isn't happening that in the normal course of things ought to dismiss the popup and give way to the Classifier This still leaves a number of possibilities what should have happened in the background includes a Zooniverse API call to load workflow number a request to fetch the workflow's json file with various content details fetching a number of JavaScript resources providing classification related functionality fetching the subject images themselves along with the little thumbnail images for the classifier buttons as well as fetching the project preferences JSON object for the current account and project combination from the API NB I'm not familiar with all the implementation details and I can't check anything on the server side myself moderator privileges extend only to the Talk pages Researcher Kevin crowston has been looking into the matter from the server angle thank you! Perhaps a comparison with the Black Hole Hunters tab projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters project which like Gravity Spy uses the new Zooniverse UI frontend may yield some useful further data But the workflow promotion machinery is specific to Gravity Spy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

It is distinguished by its confinement in both time and frequency, indicating a potentially unique source or interaction not previously cataloged. This class seems to carry implications about the nature of the noise and its boundaries, which might hint at a localized or temporary disturbance affecting the sensors.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404367\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are discussions questioning the accuracy of machine learning classifications, particularly around the "Scattered Light" glitch class. Participants discuss whether certain observations wrongly classified as "Scattered Light" should belong to other classes due to their distinctive characteristics, suggesting a review and possible refinement of classification criteria or the machine learning model itself.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science:**\n   - Participants in Dataset 2 express curiosity about the specific impacts of environmental factors on glitch classifications and ask for clarifications on how certain glitches are classified based on their appearance in spectograms. They seek deeper understanding of the criteria used for classifications, indicating a desire to better understand the technical aspects of gravitational wave detection and the operational characteristics of LIGO.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, a hypothesis is discussed regarding glitches related to "input beam jitter," describing small wobbles in the laser beam at the point of entry into vacuum vessels as a possible source of observed noise. This hypothesis is analytically motivated by the observation of glitches occurring at specific frequencies and their temporal behavior, suggesting mechanical resonances might be involved.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels:**\n   - In Dataset 2, discussions reflect concerns about whether specific glitches, like those classified under "Fuzzy Range," are peculiar to certain sensors or result from specific conditions at the Livingston or Hanford sites. These queries aim to discern if localized environmental conditions or sensor-specific issues could be influencing the data, thus impacting the reliability or consistency of glitch detection across different LIGO installations.\n     - URLs: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404367', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1722999288, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_c77e07d4ef', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=598, prompt_tokens=13399, total_tokens=13997))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

And sorry to hear about the difficulties What kind of PC laptop tablet or mobile device are you using and what kind of browser? Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ? What should happen is a popup embedded in the page which allows you to pick any unlocked workflow If this popup does appear what happens next when you pick a workflow?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread!

Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled July 26th am Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you dethodav for addressing the questions It is useful to have those defining features for the Cairn class Please note that the collection Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set is still inaccessible yielding the same error message as mentioned before Edit it works now thanks!

Some further questions and remarks So I gather the point is to teach the ML about glitches that it should not label as Scattered Light but currently does while also making sure that it will still recognize subjects that are instances of "traditional" Scattered Light Will you be able to train the ML on collections of "mere" counterexamples penalizing it for misclassifications without assigning a specific other "good" class to each "this isn't Scattered Light" subject? I understand that this hasn't been possible in the past If this still isn't possible then we need to be more careful about the training sets we're going to build They should not just collect other than Scattered Light subjects but each of them should collect subjects that really belong together into a different class They should focus on core rather than fringe examples of these different classes And they should capture the essence of each of these other classes In particular they shouldn't be limited to subjects rendered at Q only when the other class under consideration has been attracting renderings at other Q values in signficant numbers I'm hopeful that Cairn will turn out to be a good if not very populous class grouping glitches together that share a common origin As far as I can see so far it will have to include examples rendered at lower Q values and it is mostly a Livingston thing "Similar" looking subjects from Hanford are numerous but are invariably something else most Scattered Light from Hanford O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3013446?comment O4b looks somewhat cairn ish except for the Q "wheatgrass" renderings On the other hand I'm sceptical about the Hz subjects The three initial gold examples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set may turn out to be three different things spanning a range of peak frequencies as reported by Omicron and one of them visibly sloping I don't think they are tied to any specific fixed frequency features spectral lines Livingston has had a few ! glitches specifically at Hz about a year ago see LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep tab is one of these that has got labeled Scattered Light with not very high confidence but others like tab got more plausibly filed under Low Frequency Lines I'm not aware of any more recent fixed frequency glitch sources at Livingston in the Hz ballpark From Hanford we have firstly the medium frequency ripples and combs tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk showing up around and and and Hz the ones peaking near Hz have occasionally received Scattered Light labels g tab but more often Low Frequency Lines tab or No Glitch tab and secondly the Hz floor motion coupling tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches could last up to several minutes at a time and often got whitened out so thoroughly that the image producing part of Gravity Spy picked a Q value at random and left us and the ML with nothing to see These subjects are still recognizable by their peak frequencies and durations but hopeless to classify purely by the resulting images tab is a rare example rendered at Q that has attracted a Scattered Light label Here too Low Frequency Lines and No Glitch occur more often Both of these glitch class proposals already link to relevant collections But the many "NotNoGlitch" examples won't do much good in training a purely image based ML They would require a more sophisticated ML which also pays attention to the Omicron metadata peak frequency duration and SNR and perhaps one which receives renderings at all four Q values as its image input not just at a single choice which may or may not match the given glitch very well I can't help noticing that all the current members of the Traditional Scattering Gold Set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with one possible exception are marginal cases of Livingston's Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk marginal in the sense that the ground was moving at somewhat less than Hz and the penduluming item excited below its resonance was able to follow the ground motion so the arches we see are spaced more than seconds apart and all of them are Q renderings The glitch subclass proposal already links to a more representative candidate training set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant training set l a dot hz scattering from O4a These glitches have not changed much between O4a and O4b But apropos of this another question springs to mind Many of these Hz scattering glitches stay below the Hz band of loud stationary noise and thus do less harm to clean observing time than those which do show up loudly above Hz As long as we're aiming to classify by common causes and common coupling paths they all belong together Nevertheless would it make sense to maintain a distinction between very low frequency Scattered Light peak frequency below Hz and the more harmful sort peak above Hz ?

Yes the LIGO observatories have been changing a bit faster over the years than our Gravity Spy classification scheme During the ongoing fourth observing run after three years of upgrades they are throwing an unprecedented mix of new glitches at us and at their engineers We're still in the middle of sorting out what's what and trying to figure out how to improve the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component to deal with the new realities You'll meet quite a lot of "None Of The Above" subjects as you advance through the workflows The splendid multi arch Scattered Light glitches as illustrated in the Field Guide were in fact root caused already in late and fixed in January before the end of the third observing run O Scattered Light still causes numerous glitches nowadays but many of them now have their main arches below Hz where we can't see them or as in this case between and Hz with mere fragments of additional arches above Hz The Machine Learning tends to think of these as Low Frequency Burst Personally I've been classifying them as Scattered Light anyway going by how they are caused But it could also be argued that perhaps we should stick with Low Frequency Burst when the obvious noise is confined below Hz where it does less harm and reserve the Scattered Light class for arches protruding well above Hz You'll meet some of those too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/ Update I've managed to load another subject it seems like the not loading is just a side effect and not the main cause Would it be possible for you to check what levels my account has unlocked? If my account has reverted back to level the program may at some point expect me to have at least levels unlocked and is frozen because of this this would make more sense because the workflow pop up shown now is never shown otherwise because the tutorial takes priority https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Update on the occasion the assignment has loaded in the background removing the div with the class "StyledLayer sc rmtehz cULqQv" will let me solve and submit an answer! The issue of unlocked levels has however not been solved https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ OK thank you! The sentry io stuff is unrelated but the StyledLayer sc rmtehz division the last six characters will vary contains the modal "Choose a workflow" popup I conclude from this that some event isn't happening that in the normal course of things ought to dismiss the popup and give way to the Classifier This still leaves a number of possibilities what should have happened in the background includes a Zooniverse API call to load workflow number a request to fetch the workflow's json file with various content details fetching a number of JavaScript resources providing classification related functionality fetching the subject images themselves along with the little thumbnail images for the classifier buttons as well as fetching the project preferences JSON object for the current account and project combination from the API NB I'm not familiar with all the implementation details and I can't check anything on the server side myself moderator privileges extend only to the Talk pages Researcher Kevin crowston has been looking into the matter from the server angle thank you! Perhaps a comparison with the Black Hole Hunters tab projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters project which like Gravity Spy uses the new Zooniverse UI frontend may yield some useful further data But the workflow promotion machinery is specific to Gravity Spy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

These glitches might be associated with specific frequency bands and described using "fuzzy" to possibly denote a lack of clear, defined lines or patterns in the spectral display, indicating an indistinct or noise-dominated signal.\n     - URLs: \n       - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/\n       - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3396767/\n\n2. **Concerns with Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a continuation of the concerns regarding the classification of glitches such as "Scattered Light." A user discusses how the current machine learning model tends to misclassify other glitch types as "Scattered Light" and suggests that new categories might be needed for accurate categorization, reflecting ongoing issues with models not keeping pace with new glitch patterns.\n     - URLs:\n       - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Learning Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, users are more actively questioning the detailed characteristics and classification criteria of glitches. For example, discussions around whether specific patterns should be classified under existing glitch classes or if new classifications are needed indicate a deeper engagement with understanding the nuances of glitch categories and their defining features.\n     - Examples include questions about the appropriateness of labeling certain observed phenomena as "Scattered Light" when the arches are confined to specific frequency ranges or appear fragmentary.\n     - URLs:\n       - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/\n\n4. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - There is a detailed hypothesis regarding the "fuzzy range" glitches potentially originating from issues related to "input beam jitter" — small wobbles in the laser beam\'s direction at the entry of vacuum vessels. This suggests a nuanced understanding of the mechanical and operational aspects of the LIGO detectors that could influence data quality.\n     - The hypothesis provides a connection between observed data anomalies and specific operational challenges, promoting a deeper discussion about the mechanical stability and precision required in gravitational wave detection.\n     - URLs:\n       - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are discussions about whether observed glitches are linked to specific LIGO sites (e.g., Hanford or Livingston). This reflects a growing curiosity about how localized environmental conditions or site-specific operational issues might influence the type and frequency of glitches observed.\n     - Such discussions underscore an increasing awareness among citizen scientists of the complexity and sensitivity of the instruments involved in gravitational wave detection and the importance of site-specific factors in data interpretation.\n     - URLs:\n       - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/\n       - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404617/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1722999353, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_c77e07d4ef', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=722, prompt_tokens=13399, total_tokens=14121))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

Have you recently been able to work successfully in other Zooniverse projects? Which ones? I'm asking because Zooniverse is gradually migrating to new frontend user interface software Gravity Spy is already on the new frontend while many other projects are still on the old one It's possible that the new frontend might not work correctly on older browsers What exactly happens when you click on "CLASSIFY" on the Gravity Spy start page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy ?

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread!

Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled July 26th am Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you dethodav for addressing the questions It is useful to have those defining features for the Cairn class Please note that the collection Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set is still inaccessible yielding the same error message as mentioned before Edit it works now thanks!

Some further questions and remarks So I gather the point is to teach the ML about glitches that it should not label as Scattered Light but currently does while also making sure that it will still recognize subjects that are instances of "traditional" Scattered Light Will you be able to train the ML on collections of "mere" counterexamples penalizing it for misclassifications without assigning a specific other "good" class to each "this isn't Scattered Light" subject? I understand that this hasn't been possible in the past If this still isn't possible then we need to be more careful about the training sets we're going to build They should not just collect other than Scattered Light subjects but each of them should collect subjects that really belong together into a different class They should focus on core rather than fringe examples of these different classes And they should capture the essence of each of these other classes In particular they shouldn't be limited to subjects rendered at Q only when the other class under consideration has been attracting renderings at other Q values in signficant numbers I'm hopeful that Cairn will turn out to be a good if not very populous class grouping glitches together that share a common origin As far as I can see so far it will have to include examples rendered at lower Q values and it is mostly a Livingston thing "Similar" looking subjects from Hanford are numerous but are invariably something else most Scattered Light from Hanford O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3013446?comment O4b looks somewhat cairn ish except for the Q "wheatgrass" renderings On the other hand I'm sceptical about the Hz subjects The three initial gold examples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set may turn out to be three different things spanning a range of peak frequencies as reported by Omicron and one of them visibly sloping I don't think they are tied to any specific fixed frequency features spectral lines Livingston has had a few ! glitches specifically at Hz about a year ago see LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep tab is one of these that has got labeled Scattered Light with not very high confidence but others like tab got more plausibly filed under Low Frequency Lines I'm not aware of any more recent fixed frequency glitch sources at Livingston in the Hz ballpark From Hanford we have firstly the medium frequency ripples and combs tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk showing up around and and and Hz the ones peaking near Hz have occasionally received Scattered Light labels g tab but more often Low Frequency Lines tab or No Glitch tab and secondly the Hz floor motion coupling tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches could last up to several minutes at a time and often got whitened out so thoroughly that the image producing part of Gravity Spy picked a Q value at random and left us and the ML with nothing to see These subjects are still recognizable by their peak frequencies and durations but hopeless to classify purely by the resulting images tab is a rare example rendered at Q that has attracted a Scattered Light label Here too Low Frequency Lines and No Glitch occur more often Both of these glitch class proposals already link to relevant collections But the many "NotNoGlitch" examples won't do much good in training a purely image based ML They would require a more sophisticated ML which also pays attention to the Omicron metadata peak frequency duration and SNR and perhaps one which receives renderings at all four Q values as its image input not just at a single choice which may or may not match the given glitch very well I can't help noticing that all the current members of the Traditional Scattering Gold Set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with one possible exception are marginal cases of Livingston's Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk marginal in the sense that the ground was moving at somewhat less than Hz and the penduluming item excited below its resonance was able to follow the ground motion so the arches we see are spaced more than seconds apart and all of them are Q renderings The glitch subclass proposal already links to a more representative candidate training set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant training set l a dot hz scattering from O4a These glitches have not changed much between O4a and O4b But apropos of this another question springs to mind Many of these Hz scattering glitches stay below the Hz band of loud stationary noise and thus do less harm to clean observing time than those which do show up loudly above Hz As long as we're aiming to classify by common causes and common coupling paths they all belong together Nevertheless would it make sense to maintain a distinction between very low frequency Scattered Light peak frequency below Hz and the more harmful sort peak above Hz ?

Yes the LIGO observatories have been changing a bit faster over the years than our Gravity Spy classification scheme During the ongoing fourth observing run after three years of upgrades they are throwing an unprecedented mix of new glitches at us and at their engineers We're still in the middle of sorting out what's what and trying to figure out how to improve the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component to deal with the new realities You'll meet quite a lot of "None Of The Above" subjects as you advance through the workflows The splendid multi arch Scattered Light glitches as illustrated in the Field Guide were in fact root caused already in late and fixed in January before the end of the third observing run O Scattered Light still causes numerous glitches nowadays but many of them now have their main arches below Hz where we can't see them or as in this case between and Hz with mere fragments of additional arches above Hz The Machine Learning tends to think of these as Low Frequency Burst Personally I've been classifying them as Scattered Light anyway going by how they are caused But it could also be argued that perhaps we should stick with Low Frequency Burst when the obvious noise is confined below Hz where it does less harm and reserve the Scattered Light class for arches protruding well above Hz You'll meet some of those too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/ Update I've managed to load another subject it seems like the not loading is just a side effect and not the main cause Would it be possible for you to check what levels my account has unlocked? If my account has reverted back to level the program may at some point expect me to have at least levels unlocked and is frozen because of this this would make more sense because the workflow pop up shown now is never shown otherwise because the tutorial takes priority https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Update on the occasion the assignment has loaded in the background removing the div with the class "StyledLayer sc rmtehz cULqQv" will let me solve and submit an answer! The issue of unlocked levels has however not been solved https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ OK thank you! The sentry io stuff is unrelated but the StyledLayer sc rmtehz division the last six characters will vary contains the modal "Choose a workflow" popup I conclude from this that some event isn't happening that in the normal course of things ought to dismiss the popup and give way to the Classifier This still leaves a number of possibilities what should have happened in the background includes a Zooniverse API call to load workflow number a request to fetch the workflow's json file with various content details fetching a number of JavaScript resources providing classification related functionality fetching the subject images themselves along with the little thumbnail images for the classifier buttons as well as fetching the project preferences JSON object for the current account and project combination from the API NB I'm not familiar with all the implementation details and I can't check anything on the server side myself moderator privileges extend only to the Talk pages Researcher Kevin crowston has been looking into the matter from the server angle thank you! Perhaps a comparison with the Black Hole Hunters tab projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters project which like Gravity Spy uses the new Zooniverse UI frontend may yield some useful further data But the workflow promotion machinery is specific to Gravity Spy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

This glitch is characterized by disturbances occurring in specific frequency ranges, often described in conjunction with other known glitch types but with a distinct ‘fuzzy’ appearance and confined behavior in time and frequency. For instance, discussions about whether features are "fuzzy range blips" suggest these are localized disruptions potentially linked to equipment or environmental conditions.\n   - URLs: \n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404367/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, concerns are raised about the adequacy of existing classifications, particularly regarding the "Scattered Light" classification. Discussions suggest that the manifestations of what is being classified as Scattered Light are diverse, prompting suggestions that additional sub-categories or entirely new classes might be needed to more accurately categorize these observations. This concern reflects an ongoing evaluation of the classification schema in light of new data.\n   - URLs:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, questions emerge about the technical aspects of glitches, notably concerning the specific characteristics that distinguish one class from another. There are also inquiries about the implications of these glitches on the overall reliability and sensitivity of the LIGO detectors, reflecting a deeper interest in both the scientific and operational aspects of gravitational wave research.\n   - URLs:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Several hypotheses about glitch origins are discussed, including environmental factors such as loose connections or equipment instability noted in specific incidents where a glitch coincided with equipment issues (e.g., a loose cable at Livingston). These discussions exemplify a more nuanced understanding of how external conditions and hardware issues may manifest as observable glitches in data.\n   - Analytical motivation for these hypotheses often stems from temporal correlations between observed glitches and logged equipment issues or environmental conditions, suggesting direct or indirect causative links.\n   - URLs:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404617/\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Glitches Connected to Specific Sensors or Channels:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is explicit discussion about the implications of glitches being specifically related to certain sensors or signal channels. For example, the distinction between glitches observed at Hanford and Livingston sites is scrutinized, with attempts to determine if similar patterns at different sites have common causes or if site-specific factors play a role.\n   - These discussions reflect a sophisticated level of engagement, where citizen scientists are not just categorizing glitches but are also considering the broader implications of where and how these glitches are detected.\n   - URLs:\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404363/\n     - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404367/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1722999430, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_c77e07d4ef', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=728, prompt_tokens=13399, total_tokens=14127))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

I a scientist working with the Gravity Spy team and the LIGO Detector Characterization group I wanted to reach out to everyone here on Zooniverse to enlist your help in improving the Gravity Spy machine learning based classifications As all of you are aware there have been a few new glitch classes in this past observing run that are quite different from previous observing runs As such the Gravity Spy team is working to update our machine learning models to include these new classes One class of glitch that is particularly confusing the machine learning model is Scattered Light Looking through the set of glitches classified as Scattered Light LIGO researchers have identified at least three different classes that have been placed in this class by the machine learning model These are Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with the arch structure expected of scattered light Cairn glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set like the pile of rocks https en wikipedia org wiki Cairn that are somewhat similar to traditional scattering but without a clear arch structure Hz glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set that are a single line of noise near Hz We need a large dataset of each glitch class particularly for Cairn and Hz glitches to help retrain the Gravity Spy model on these classes It would be very helpful if users could be on the lookout for these types of glitches to create larger collections the larger the collection of glitches that we can identify from each class the better the Gravity Spy model will be able to learn the difference between these classes If you notice these glitches or already have a related collection please add a link to your collection in this thread!

Do you have any ad blockers installed that could interact with both Chrome and Safari and that might mistakenly prevent them from contacting some of Zooniverse's backend servers while still allowing the main www zooniverse org site to pass? The project Einstein Home Pulsar Seekers projects rsengar einstein at home pulsar seekers is still on the old Zooniverse user interface frontend like Gravity Spy was until about a year ago For an example of another project that's already on the new UI frontend like Gravity Spy is now may I ask you to have a brief look at Black Hole Hunters projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters is that one usable for you or does it show similar symptoms? If that project's Classifier also fails to load properly then we're dealing with some issue between the Zooniverse infrastructure and your setup and not with something specific to Gravity Spy In this case I would recomment to start a new thread in the Zooniverse > Talk > Troubleshooting tab talk board following the instructions in the thread pinned at the top there tab talk If Black Hole Hunters works for you while Gravity Spy does not then further browser side debugging may be required to isolate which step exactly is failing Have you used g Safari's Web Inspector tool before? It could be used to look at the dozens of browser server interactions during each single page load in detail and compare at which point the sequence begins to differ between the two projects Good luck and do let me know how it goes! I hope you'll soon be able to contribute to Gravity Spy again and participate in discussions about all the weird new glitches the LIGO interferometers have been producing of late! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I'd go for None Of The Above Whatever this is it seems to have been a one of a kind affair so far recorded on with a reported peak frequency of Hz it can't be related to the glitches for which the Hz Line class had been introduced and which had happened only during a few days in April The Field Guide entry links to a logbook entry with the longer story https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399475/ Interesting catch Given when it happened and given the faint feature just above Hz this must actually belong with Hanford's Bike Chain glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Several of those have shown reverberations in the Hz ballpark and at some other frequencies in addition to the main feature near Hz and a few of them have come with reported peak frequencies around Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3399565/ Pretty catch!

We'll be glad to assist Since the "New glitch classes " boards are writable only for moderators and researchers I have moved this thread over to the Collections board where everyone will have a chance to participate Could you please double check the URL pointing at your "traditional gold set" collection and make sure it isn't marked as private? It is not currently accessible under the link above I'd like to be sure what you have in mind there since there are quite a number of different looking sub classes of glitches whose arch shapes betray a scattering origin and even more that must have a scattered light origin but don't show recognizable arches For starters already the Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk glitches exhibit a fairly wide range of morphologies depending on the circumstances of the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Note Re posting here my earlier comment from a temporary thread with comments enabled July 26th am Hi It is always interesting to further help in training the ML model Please note that the first collection in the list Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set yields a There was an error retrieving this collection I have a couple of questions by looking at the last two collections in the list Are you interested in only O4b glitches or the whole O run? Is it in particular for L that it is needed or for H too? To find better suited glitches through sim search is there a constraining frequency range and duration for Cairn glitches that needs to be applied in order to filter out irrelevant events? Thank you Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ A highway with crossroads type glitch though centered at about with the mark being the beginning of the glitch and a parallel road centered at about https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ A very dense compacted koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400374/ Maybe just wheatgrass but seems more dense closer to a forest fire I think https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400377/ Harmonic glitches 350Hz though the middle glitch isn't consistently as loud as the other two about every 7s looks like there might be more after https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400532/ Thanks ZngabitanT for noting the issue in my original post this how now been fixed Answering a few question from you and Coralbell I agree that there's quite a wide range of different morphologies that could be fit into the scattered light model We haven't noticed as many issues with the Hz scattering being misclassified so that subclass is not as high of a concern for the machine learning classifications at present We are interested in glitches from all of O if they are present The collections I linked are only some of the most recent glitches that researchers had identified as problematic for the machine learning classifications We are also interested in H glitches if present That's a good question about the frequency and duration of the glitches I would say oen of the defining features of the Cairn class is that there is broadband noise from Hz to over Hz Furthermore each glitch only lasts 5s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you dethodav for addressing the questions It is useful to have those defining features for the Cairn class Please note that the collection Traditional scattered light glitches https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional gold set is still inaccessible yielding the same error message as mentioned before Edit it works now thanks!

Some further questions and remarks So I gather the point is to teach the ML about glitches that it should not label as Scattered Light but currently does while also making sure that it will still recognize subjects that are instances of "traditional" Scattered Light Will you be able to train the ML on collections of "mere" counterexamples penalizing it for misclassifications without assigning a specific other "good" class to each "this isn't Scattered Light" subject? I understand that this hasn't been possible in the past If this still isn't possible then we need to be more careful about the training sets we're going to build They should not just collect other than Scattered Light subjects but each of them should collect subjects that really belong together into a different class They should focus on core rather than fringe examples of these different classes And they should capture the essence of each of these other classes In particular they shouldn't be limited to subjects rendered at Q only when the other class under consideration has been attracting renderings at other Q values in signficant numbers I'm hopeful that Cairn will turn out to be a good if not very populous class grouping glitches together that share a common origin As far as I can see so far it will have to include examples rendered at lower Q values and it is mostly a Livingston thing "Similar" looking subjects from Hanford are numerous but are invariably something else most Scattered Light from Hanford O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3013446?comment O4b looks somewhat cairn ish except for the Q "wheatgrass" renderings On the other hand I'm sceptical about the Hz subjects The three initial gold examples tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav hz gold set may turn out to be three different things spanning a range of peak frequencies as reported by Omicron and one of them visibly sloping I don't think they are tied to any specific fixed frequency features spectral lines Livingston has had a few ! glitches specifically at Hz about a year ago see LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep tab is one of these that has got labeled Scattered Light with not very high confidence but others like tab got more plausibly filed under Low Frequency Lines I'm not aware of any more recent fixed frequency glitch sources at Livingston in the Hz ballpark From Hanford we have firstly the medium frequency ripples and combs tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk showing up around and and and Hz the ones peaking near Hz have occasionally received Scattered Light labels g tab but more often Low Frequency Lines tab or No Glitch tab and secondly the Hz floor motion coupling tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches could last up to several minutes at a time and often got whitened out so thoroughly that the image producing part of Gravity Spy picked a Q value at random and left us and the ML with nothing to see These subjects are still recognizable by their peak frequencies and durations but hopeless to classify purely by the resulting images tab is a rare example rendered at Q that has attracted a Scattered Light label Here too Low Frequency Lines and No Glitch occur more often Both of these glitch class proposals already link to relevant collections But the many "NotNoGlitch" examples won't do much good in training a purely image based ML They would require a more sophisticated ML which also pays attention to the Omicron metadata peak frequency duration and SNR and perhaps one which receives renderings at all four Q values as its image input not just at a single choice which may or may not match the given glitch very well I can't help noticing that all the current members of the Traditional Scattering Gold Set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav traditional scattering gold set with one possible exception are marginal cases of Livingston's Hz scattering tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk marginal in the sense that the ground was moving at somewhat less than Hz and the penduluming item excited below its resonance was able to follow the ground motion so the arches we see are spaced more than seconds apart and all of them are Q renderings The glitch subclass proposal already links to a more representative candidate training set tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant training set l a dot hz scattering from O4a These glitches have not changed much between O4a and O4b But apropos of this another question springs to mind Many of these Hz scattering glitches stay below the Hz band of loud stationary noise and thus do less harm to clean observing time than those which do show up loudly above Hz As long as we're aiming to classify by common causes and common coupling paths they all belong together Nevertheless would it make sense to maintain a distinction between very low frequency Scattered Light peak frequency below Hz and the more harmful sort peak above Hz ?

Yes the LIGO observatories have been changing a bit faster over the years than our Gravity Spy classification scheme During the ongoing fourth observing run after three years of upgrades they are throwing an unprecedented mix of new glitches at us and at their engineers We're still in the middle of sorting out what's what and trying to figure out how to improve the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component to deal with the new realities You'll meet quite a lot of "None Of The Above" subjects as you advance through the workflows The splendid multi arch Scattered Light glitches as illustrated in the Field Guide were in fact root caused already in late and fixed in January before the end of the third observing run O Scattered Light still causes numerous glitches nowadays but many of them now have their main arches below Hz where we can't see them or as in this case between and Hz with mere fragments of additional arches above Hz The Machine Learning tends to think of these as Low Frequency Burst Personally I've been classifying them as Scattered Light anyway going by how they are caused But it could also be argued that perhaps we should stick with Low Frequency Burst when the obvious noise is confined below Hz where it does less harm and reserve the Scattered Light class for arches protruding well above Hz You'll meet some of those too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/ Update I've managed to load another subject it seems like the not loading is just a side effect and not the main cause Would it be possible for you to check what levels my account has unlocked? If my account has reverted back to level the program may at some point expect me to have at least levels unlocked and is frozen because of this this would make more sense because the workflow pop up shown now is never shown otherwise because the tutorial takes priority https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Update on the occasion the assignment has loaded in the background removing the div with the class "StyledLayer sc rmtehz cULqQv" will let me solve and submit an answer! The issue of unlocked levels has however not been solved https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ OK thank you! The sentry io stuff is unrelated but the StyledLayer sc rmtehz division the last six characters will vary contains the modal "Choose a workflow" popup I conclude from this that some event isn't happening that in the normal course of things ought to dismiss the popup and give way to the Classifier This still leaves a number of possibilities what should have happened in the background includes a Zooniverse API call to load workflow number a request to fetch the workflow's json file with various content details fetching a number of JavaScript resources providing classification related functionality fetching the subject images themselves along with the little thumbnail images for the classifier buttons as well as fetching the project preferences JSON object for the current account and project combination from the API NB I'm not familiar with all the implementation details and I can't check anything on the server side myself moderator privileges extend only to the Talk pages Researcher Kevin crowston has been looking into the matter from the server angle thank you! Perhaps a comparison with the Black Hole Hunters tab projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters project which like Gravity Spy uses the new Zooniverse UI frontend may yield some useful further data But the workflow promotion machinery is specific to Gravity Spy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9tRAcOcQV2zvdPP28FEIRe4erVfd6', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='1. **New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Fuzzy Range Glitch:** Repeatedly mentioned throughout Talk Dataset 2, the "fuzzy range glitch" seems to be a new classification. Descriptions suggest these glitches appear as fuzzy, blurry disturbances in the spectograms, potentially indicative of a subtle, yet wide-reaching impact on the sensor data. This category underscores a nuanced type of interference possibly missed in broader classifications.\n   - **Violin Mode Harmonic Glitch:** Although "Violin Mode Harmonic" already exists, its specific mention with the "300Hz violin" phrase suggests a nuanced understanding or a sub-category focusing on the 300Hz frequency specifically, indicating a more refined analysis by the citizen scientists.\n\n   URLs: \n   - Fuzzy Range Glitch: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402076/, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3402079/\n   - Violin Mode Harmonic Glitch: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404366/\n\n2. **Concerns with Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - Several participants in Talk Dataset 2 express concerns about the classification accuracy and specificity, particularly around classes like "Scattered Light." They notice that many glitches classified under this traditional category exhibit significant differences, suggesting the potential need for reclassification or the creation of sub-categories to better reflect their unique characteristics. This indicates an ongoing challenge in fitting observed data neatly into existing categories without losing critical detail.\n   \n   URLs:\n   - Concerns about "Scattered Light": https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a notable curiosity about specific frequency bands and their relation to known glitch types, like questioning the 300Hz range in relation to violin mode harmonics. These questions show a deepening engagement and understanding of how specific frequencies might correlate with certain physical phenomena or sensor characteristics.\n   - Another prevalent inquiry revolves around the effectiveness and reliability of classification algorithms. Citizen scientists are interested in how machine learning models are trained with new data, particularly how anomalies are integrated into these models to improve predictive accuracy.\n   - There\'s also a discussion regarding how environmental factors like earthquakes could influence the sensors and lead to specific glitches, pointing towards a broader multidisciplinary engagement with geophysical and engineering data.\n\n   URLs:\n   - Classification and frequency queries: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404366/\n\n4. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - Several contributions hypothesize that specific hardware components, such as the squeezer subsystem, when malfunctioning, are responsible for a series of related glitches observed as "fuzzy range glitches." The analytical motivation here is the temporal alignment of these glitches with recorded hardware issues, suggesting a direct causal relationship.\n   - Another hypothesis involves environmental influences like seismic activities potentially causing or influencing certain types of glitches. This is backed by the observation of glitch occurrences in synchrony with external seismic events, leading to hypotheses about ground movement affecting sensor stability.\n\n   URLs:\n   - Hardware and environmental hypotheses: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404617/\n\n5. **Sensor-Specific Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there emerges a clearer focus on how specific sensors or sensor arrays might be particularly susceptible or reactive to certain types of glitches. Questions arise about whether patterns of glitches can be linked to particular sensor channels, which could suggest localized physical or electronic issues affecting data integrity.\n   - There\'s also a noticeable interest in whether the behaviors of glitches are consistent across different LIGO sites, pointing towards inquiries on systemic versus localized instrumental behaviors. These discussions could lead to more targeted maintenance or calibration strategies for specific sensors.\n\n   URLs:\n   - Sensor-specific discussions: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3404366/', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1722999510, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_c77e07d4ef', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=878, prompt_tokens=13399, total_tokens=14277))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk Dataset 1:

It had been working flawlessly for the last couple of years https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I just tried level with my own account a test account and not logged in and did not see a problem I will check the user ID you mentioned https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk to and thank you for the bug report sorry to hear about the issue! Yours seems to be the second account affected in this way after a recent similar report tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Our researchers are still investigating Would you be able to delve into some further details with browser debug tools? There might be some explicit error message hiding in the JavaScript console or some query sent to the Zooniverse servers during the page loading that returns an unexpected result to the browser But don't worry if that sounds too challenging https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Actually I can change the user's workflow but can't read it If they are still having problems I think they will need to contact Zooniverse for support https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Thank you Kevin for investigating! Would you be able to adjust both affected accounts icecreamdoc's and t 's to have levels inclusive unlocked and we'll see what happens next and whether level will be unlocked in due course?

Yes the LIGO observatories have been changing a bit faster over the years than our Gravity Spy classification scheme During the ongoing fourth observing run after three years of upgrades they are throwing an unprecedented mix of new glitches at us and at their engineers We're still in the middle of sorting out what's what and trying to figure out how to improve the Gravity Spy Machine Learning component to deal with the new realities You'll meet quite a lot of "None Of The Above" subjects as you advance through the workflows The splendid multi arch Scattered Light glitches as illustrated in the Field Guide were in fact root caused already in late and fixed in January before the end of the third observing run O Scattered Light still causes numerous glitches nowadays but many of them now have their main arches below Hz where we can't see them or as in this case between and Hz with mere fragments of additional arches above Hz The Machine Learning tends to think of these as Low Frequency Burst Personally I've been classifying them as Scattered Light anyway going by how they are caused But it could also be argued that perhaps we should stick with Low Frequency Burst when the obvious noise is confined below Hz where it does less harm and reserve the Scattered Light class for arches protruding well above Hz You'll meet some of those too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3406037/ Update I've managed to load another subject it seems like the not loading is just a side effect and not the main cause Would it be possible for you to check what levels my account has unlocked? If my account has reverted back to level the program may at some point expect me to have at least levels unlocked and is frozen because of this this would make more sense because the workflow pop up shown now is never shown otherwise because the tutorial takes priority https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Update on the occasion the assignment has loaded in the background removing the div with the class "StyledLayer sc rmtehz cULqQv" will let me solve and submit an answer! The issue of unlocked levels has however not been solved https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ OK thank you! The sentry io stuff is unrelated but the StyledLayer sc rmtehz division the last six characters will vary contains the modal "Choose a workflow" popup I conclude from this that some event isn't happening that in the normal course of things ought to dismiss the popup and give way to the Classifier This still leaves a number of possibilities what should have happened in the background includes a Zooniverse API call to load workflow number a request to fetch the workflow's json file with various content details fetching a number of JavaScript resources providing classification related functionality fetching the subject images themselves along with the little thumbnail images for the classifier buttons as well as fetching the project preferences JSON object for the current account and project combination from the API NB I'm not familiar with all the implementation details and I can't check anything on the server side myself moderator privileges extend only to the Talk pages Researcher Kevin crowston has been looking into the matter from the server angle thank you! Perhaps a comparison with the Black Hole Hunters tab projects cobalt lensing black hole hunters project which like Gravity Spy uses the new Zooniverse UI frontend may yield some useful further data But the workflow promotion machinery is specific to Gravity Spy https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Would it be possible to promote me to level manually? I wonder if the popup functions correctly if I have more than one workflow unlocked https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Any ideas to help me out as at this point I have given up hope to be able to classify in Gravity Spy going forward https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ I updated their preferences see if that helps https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Disorganized glitches across the time frame between about 32Hz and 300Hz It doesn't look dense enough to be fuzzy range though it might lead into that https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3407499/ That seems to have fixed it! I can now access level and without any issues https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi This fixed it for me also I can now access levels and with no problems!! THANKS! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Very small teardrop? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3407641/ Extremely loud koifish? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3407656/ Thanks a lot Kevin! And thanks also icecreamdoc and to for the prompt feedback have fun with our weird and wonderful glitches! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Per the companion thread tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk the issue has been resolved for both accounts https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Yes it's another item from Livingston's "fuzzy range" " Hz monster" episode tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3314162?comment Date and approximate time and peak frequency reported as Hz and general appearance all fit into the bigger picture https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3407499/ Yes a small very slim fringe case of a blip By the way the fainter low frequency noise features flanking it in frames and are a form of scattered light nicknamed "wheatgrass" In workflow levels we may ignore them focusing on the central feature the glitch which actually triggered the subject https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3407641/ Pretty catch! This is a chance coincidence of two unrelated glitches a rather loud but not quite extremely loud central blip with enough energy in the Hz region to have produced "lighthouse" artefacts up there plus a whole lot of probably scattered light noise at frequencies below Hz appearing distorted by the way this subject has been processed with very fine time resolution at the expense of very coarse frequency resolution so as to show the central short duration glitch to best effect I'm unable to tell whether Koi Fish "fins" are also present flanking the central glitch if they are present then they are hidden under the other low frequency noise When I first ran into this subject in the level workflow I called it "None Of The Above" which is always an option when something doesn't want to neatly fit into the available classes A few weeks later I met it again in the level workflow and this time I went for "Blip" "Koi Fish" is another possibility The Gravity Spy Machine Learning was confused and picked Violin Mode When in doubt you can always play it safe and choose None Of The Above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3407656/ Good to hear Not sure what was wrong https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Blip? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3409141/ Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and thank you for contributing! Repeating Blips would be an option for subjects like this from the level workflow onwards in the early three levels you could use Blip for the central shape or None Of The Above on the assumption that this whole group probably comes from a common cause and should be treated as a single compound glitch rather than as a chance near coincidence of independently caused glitches https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3409141/ Hi I seem to have gotten the same problem as mentioned above Hope you could try the same for me https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ AlexanderWehl I set your level to level but can change it to something else if that's appropriate But just resetting it might help I think there might be a more systemic problem so I will report it to Zooniverse and ask them to investigate https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Not sure what this is But think it looks a bit like a amplified whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3409504/ Looked like 'Ah' between and Could be scattered light maybe but very low frequency but I'm not confident of that https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3409512/ I have gotten this glitch quite a few times before Should there be a new category for it? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3409514/ Thank you very much for your reply I am trying to learn as much as I can so that I can make a better contribution to this project https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3409141/ Yes this is a Whistle three in a row in fact plus unrelated lower frequency noise in frame from early February Whistles are a kind of glitch that hasn't yet reoccurred during the ongoing fourth observing run so we've kept a few examples from the third in the early workflow levels Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and thank you for contributing! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3409504/ Yes these glitches first occurred at Hanford in larger numbers in July and gradually disappeared again towards the end of that year There's a pending glitch class proposal tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk for them For now they can be classified as None Of The Above https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3409514/ Agreed A marginal example of this subclass tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk with the arches staying below Hz and spaced a little more than seconds apart from one culmination to the next https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3409512/ Thank you! You'll encounter quite a lot of "None Of The Above" subjects as you advance through the workflows During the ongoing fourth observing run after three years of upgrades the LIGO interferometers have been producing a glitch mix that's rather different from anything we had seen before Some glitch classes no longer occur some still do but look different and some completely new stuff has been coming up We're still in the middle of working out what's what Please be welcome to comment or ask about anything that looks peculiar! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3409141/ Seems a bit like a sea serpent between about and classified as scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3409713/ I have difficulty classifying this glitch and have encountered it some times now Is this Violin Mode Harmonics or Wandering Line or should this be classified as None of the above? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/331/3409728/ Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk! You're on the right track This is a Wandering Line a spectral line tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk that wanders around on timescales of seconds or hours or months on the frequency axis In the early workflow levels where this class is not yet available None Of The Above is appropriate See here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3275733?comment for more about what had happened at Hanford on this particular occasion Thank you for contributing!

there's no need to preach to the converted I should also mention that you're setting a good example here When using similarity searches to explore one hypothetical or confirmed glitch class it's important to stop every once in a while and take a close look at the marginal cases outliers and probable non examples that have come up among the sim search results in other words to explore the boundaries of the glitch population of interest both from the inside and from the outside It also helps to switch focus every once in a while working with one glitch class for a couple of hours at a time and then proceeding to another and later to a third to keep one's own perception evenly calibrated Looking at only one kind of glitches only from the inside for a week or more at a time would be a recipe for mission creep one would be tempted to subsume more and more stuff that doesn't really belong into the topic of investigation That seems to be a built in drawback of our human bio neural

still don't know what had caused them Around that time there were some issue with uploading fresh subjects to Zooniverse and simultaneously to the Gravity Spy tools tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu which resulted in a number of incomplete uploads and repeat attempts ultimately each of these glitches has ended up on Zooniverse five or six times with different subject numbers while only the final uploads those with 9636xxxx subject numbers have successfully made it into the Similarity Search tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search tool You can use the Similarity Search tool to among other things read out the peak frequency of subject tab the good one of which the present subject is now an extraneous duplicate Hz The incompletely uploaded subjects

your own collection of these Hz glitches For the reasons just listed I would however recommend to collect only the 9636xxxx specimens and ignore the earlier duplicates and not to comment on their

initial request at the top of this thread I curated two growing investigative collections Cairn O H tab https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections coralbell cairn h o Cairn O L tab https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections coralbell cairn l o I began by using as sim search seed each of the eight Cairn O L subjects in the gold set collection https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy collections dethodav cairn gold set provided by dethodav I looked into O H and L through many more iterations small batch of results trying to narrow down on particular features and according to what we had initially discussed in this conversation so far DYCWMI Next in here I use to add the DYCWMI details and histograms for reference but there are current issues with this tool I have been getting a No data available in table message Both my Cairn collections are built from sim search only they are representative and public My username is entered correctly If the tool comes back I shall update this section accordingly Notes There are not many subjects collected as it turned out that sim searches are flooded by similar looking types Such other similar glitch types might have been included in my collections as we need to better understand Cairn I collected single glitches appearing in the frames with no other visually prominent glitch alongside All subjects are rendered with Q value Added in order to keep both collections visually coherent Hopefully will collect subjects with the other three Q values to have a broader view Hz and up to about Slightly to no arching lines in frame Did not collect gold subjects returned by sim search in order to keep to new results I included some seemingly borderline subjects These are raw initial collections that may evolve according to new information gathered over time Observations There are seeming Cairn glitches in H as well even more abundant than in L as initially suspected but they need to be further investigated to be distinguished from very similar glitch types Duration can go further up to per gold set subject https www zooniverse org but most results considered turned under Collection results initially span O4a for H and both O4a and O4b for L Some O L results I presume resemble L ER O4a Power Line https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy

How many minimum lines are we looking for with prominent energy at Q value 25? Gold subject https www zooniverse org ? has one thick line in frame and no stacking dome shape in frame would this qualify as cairn ? Are we looking at slightly to no arching lines only in frame at Q 25? Frames mostly show arched lines in a dome shape A Sim Search Ongoing Consideration ZngabitanT Sim search dichotomy https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2504250?comment is an issue I believe to keep considering as it is entrenched in the tool For this current O run I am not sure if we can have a clear map of what subject sets lie on which dichotomy side to act accordingly as we did for O and earlier especially for very large searches when it starts to weigh down and constrain results even more Thank you Minor edits for clarity https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Well thank you for the compliment!

We would focus on the glitch closest to time seconds or dominant at this time when there are different kinds of unrelated glitches in view by coincidence In the present case we're dealing with a compound glitch that lasted rather longer than seconds and where the whole affair should be treated as a single event In fact it's part of an episode at Hanford that lasted more than a day on and it was a new kind of glitch for LIGO then though similar things have happened on a couple of other occasions since and there were enough of them already back in November to earn their own glitch class proposal tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk For now we can classify them as None Of The Above Fun fact The Hanford operators also used the word "fuzzy" although they were referring to what these glitches were doing to the observatory sensitivity not to their appearance in our images It is sometimes hard to tell whether a subject shows a compound glitch group or a chance near coincidence of independently caused glitches years of experience help There are even some cases tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk where ultimately a single cause had been at work interfering with the proper workings of the interferometer in multiple ways and indirectly leading to a multitude of near simultaneous glitches of different types Returning to the present subject The small bright central feature here had indeed rung in at Hz as you can verify by feeding the subject number to the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search close to Hz but not quite there Power Line glitches have been absent at Hanford during the fourth observing run so far as far as I can tell although we've had a number of them from Livingston ER and O4a tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant l er a power line Which reminds me one of these days I'll need to start a collection of those from Livingston during Engineering Run and O4b They often show a tell tale pair of "eyes" There's always some Hz noise present which always needs to be carefully subtracted When there's a sudden brief excess it will be momentarily overcompensated then undercompensated then overcompensated again producing those "eye" features https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/331/3411355/ Thanks for the great answer I too noticed that a similar pattern returned at other times such as in Livingstone 04b Well at least I share the intuition of naming things https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/331/3411355/ Thank you Coralbell!

     Thank you Coralbell for your thoughts! At the moment I don't have much more to say about Cairns while we wait for feedback from the researchers I'll keep working on my enqueued sim search results and adding to my collections as appropriate However it doesn't look like we're going to end up with sufficiently many subjects to build a decent training set the lower limit of subjects for a glitch class proposal exists for a reason Not unless more of these glitches arrive in the coming weeks and months I've already provided links to several collections of subjects that I believe should be classified as Scattered Light so there's not much more to say here either for now I took a serious look at the Hz stuff yesterday and this morning and one lightbulb after another lit up bulb bulb bulb This will turn into a sufficiently long story to be written up elsewhere but again there aren't really enough subjects for a training set Executive summary Yes there's a well defined population of glitches that have attracted Scattered Light mis labelings from the ML It lives near Hz upconversion often produces additional noise near Hz it's practically all from Livingston unrelated to the Hanford glitches near and Hz already mentioned earlier! and it had mostly got fixed by early July so O4b examples are rare https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Thank you for the summaries ZngabitanT!

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.
    
GRAVITYBOT RESPONSE:
ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-9xxIM8LXHJPkh4hrJ6y6fbBTtx4Gh', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='1. **New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **HXTS Bounce and Roll Modes**: This new glitch class proposed in Talk Dataset 2 concerns long duration horizontal lines at specific frequencies, identified predominantly at Livingston. The glitches are categorized into \'bounce\' and \'roll\' modes based on their frequency characteristics, with bounce modes near 70 Hz and roll modes around 140 Hz. The hypothesis is that these glitches might be caused by the mechanical motion of the suspended optics in the detectors.\n\n   URLs influencing response: \n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3418449\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - A significant concern raised in Talk Dataset 2 is the misclassification by the Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Specific glitches like those around 70 Hz, which have distinct characteristics (related to the new proposed class of HXTS bounce and roll modes), are often mislabeled as "Scattered Light" due to their appearance in spectograms. This points to a need for retraining or adjustment of the ML algorithms to better distinguish these types of glitches.\n\n   URLs influencing response:\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3418449\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - There are inquiries regarding the effectiveness of the current ML algorithms, particularly their ability to correctly classify new types of glitches that do not fit neatly into existing categories. This stems from the observation that new glitch behaviors are appearing that are not well-represented in the current training sets.\n   - Questions are also emerging about whether the physical characteristics of the sensors, such as orientation or location, might be influencing the occurrence or detection of certain glitches.\n   - There is a technical interest in understanding how environmental conditions, particularly seismic activities, may influence the frequency and type of glitches observed, leading to questions about correlating external environmental data with glitch occurrences for better predictive analysis.\n\n   URLs influencing response:\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3418449\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3416650\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins:**\n   - One hypothesis discussed in Talk Dataset 2 is the effect of mechanical resonances of the detector\'s suspension system (specifically bounce and roll modes) on the glitches observed around 70 Hz and 140 Hz. This hypothesis is analytically motivated by observed correlations between these glitches and specific mechanical configurations and movements within the detector setup.\n   - Another hypothesis involves the environmental impact, such as logging activities near the LIGO observatories, which are suggested as potential causes of specific glitch patterns due to the vibration they introduce into the ground and subsequently into the detector apparatus.\n\n   URLs influencing response:\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3418449\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Connections of Glitches to Specific Sensors or Channels:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are discussions about the specific sensors and their contributions to the recorded glitches, particularly those linked to the suspension system\'s mechanical movements. Questions are raised regarding how different components of the suspension system, such as the bounce and roll modes, might differentially contribute to the glitches observed.\n   - There is also a question about whether certain channels or sensors are more sensitive to external disturbances, such as earthquakes or anthropogenic activities, and how these might be better monitored or adjusted to reduce false positives in glitch detection.\n\n   URLs influencing response:\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3418449\n   - https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3416650', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1724076310, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_c77e07d4ef', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=820, prompt_tokens=18771, total_tokens=19591))

After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

It definitely endorses me to dive into gravity spy data again and again knowing my questions are going to be addressed in a very comprehensive and friendly manner I will definitely try to get familiar with similarity search tool so far I am trying to establish some kind of a pipeline of subsequent actions which one should do in general to investigate different glitches I've just started to understand time frequency resolution tradeoffs which on its own is kind of hard to wrap one's head around now there are additional tools At least it seems to me there are so many different sources to consider but I've got a feeling something settles in my head at last https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3416650/ Thank you sounds like a plan! Do take it easy though Rome LIGO wasn't built in a day and there's no substitute for experience acquired over many weeks months and years Keep going and experience will settle on your shoulders like snow on a tree My personal subject studying routine is somewhat complicated but it has evolved over more then five years and is underpinned by having looked at more than a hundred thousand glitches and by keeping long lists of subject numbers and annotations in offline files Let me recommend one additional source of information It's worth keeping a corner of an eye on what other people both veterans and new volunteers are posting in our Talk boards tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk There are some gems to be found also among comments from past years so when you're just finishing classifying something interesting looking you can click Done Talk instead of Done to see the subject's Talk page and any prior discussions linked from it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3416650/ Hi Since at least July to date there are several mentions in Talk of a pending DYCWMI tool bugfix to have it work with ER and O subjects I tried the tool today and it still returns a No data available in table https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu collection info collection info ?username coralbell collection display name cairn l o Being already through O4b the tool is much needed for volunteer glitch investigations by offering collection metadata at a glance to observe ranges group characteristics and more As external text editing files are to be used to investigate glitches in the absence of the DYCWMI tool a manual copy paste is required for collections in painstaking manual work subject by subject for what the tool would automatically provide Even further histograms are important visualization tools to determine how the population distribution of collections behaves In the absence of an automated collection histogram it is very challenging to try to create an external distribution chart because with event time metadata null in sim search until O data is publicly released the event date needs to be manually extracted from each spectrogram through the Info button be manually added to each subject metadata row in that external file then processed and finetuned Repeat this many times till an investigation turns satisfactory enough The DYCWMI tool is very useful to the community at large and is vital to round up information and decisions as investigative collections evolve into final curated sets with all information ready for the researchers to consider I would like to hear about the status of the tool bugfix and when it would be expected to be operational with ER and O collections Thank you for your attention and all efforts done by the teams to fix bugs all along Sincerely Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3421335/ Wheatgrass or LF blip? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421450/ Tomte koi https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421452/ Scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421454/ Is this vaguely cairn ish? 71Hz Q NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421457/ Ripple comb? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421458/ Extremely loud is there an anglerfish in there? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421460/ Anglerfish flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421462/ 12Hz 11 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421464/ Melted blip 26Hz but I went for NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421470/ Slightly fuzzy? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421472/ Fuzzy range 78Hz 22 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421474/ Anglerfish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421477/ Fuzzy range 22 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421480/ line 52Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421484/ Baby koi flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421485/ Lighthouse koi https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421486/ Off centre Marie Celeste NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ Repeating blips https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421487/ Flock of ?

What's less cool from a LIGO engineer's point of view is that this has been the most common type of glitch at Livingston since the beginning of the fourth observing run in May and it is still not clear how exactly these glitches arise We no longer get the sort of multi arch Scattered Light that was common in past years and that's illustrated in the Field Guide that sort was root caused in late tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and cleverly fixed in January before the end of O But we do still get stacks of Scattered Light arches shifted to somewhat lower frequencies as in this present example Most of the action is now below the Hz bottom edge of our images where it does little harm but one strong arch rises above the bottom edge to culminate near Hz and a fainter parallel arch reaches up to about Hz The two arches are separated by a darker band covering Hz punctuated by three evenly spaced streaks tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk that's a region where there's a lot of always present stationary background noise which gets suppressed before our images are created So it's a new variant of lower frequency Scattered Light but it's unclear where the scattering happens at the corner station or near one of the two test masses at the ends of the arms and it's unclear what the reflecting item is that's moving relative to the test masses https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Huh so if I understand it correctly something is moving which causes the laser to move slightly thus registering as a "quake" I don't know the appropiate terminolgy sorry and you don't yet know what exactly is moving? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Rapid cycling glitches with the tips being the loudest almost flame like with a very quiet baseline maybe suppressed in this resolution? between about and 72Hz and the tips between about and 400Hz with a frequency of about 125s between peaks https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422780/ A pair of koi fish with the heads centered at about and 0s and a blip centered at about 8s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422784/ Whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/157809/ Lfb https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423032/ Background noise much more vibrant in this one! Something weird happened here https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Yes! We're living on a restless planet Even aside from earthquakes strong enough to be felt the ground beneath our feet is always in motion at speeds of up to about a micrometer per second caused by a mix of weak distant earthquakes wind driven ocean wave activity human activity plus gusts of wind leaning on building walls which then lean on the pillars which support them which then causes the floor under the pillars to tilt a little LIGO's vacuum chambers and the beam tubes connecting them along with anything attached to the walls of the vacuum vessels follow these ground motions Inside four of the large vacuum chambers at each site there are the test masses in their four stage "quad" pendulum suspensions mounted on a three stage internal seismic isolation structure mounted in turn on a hydraulic external pre isolation For some pictures of the hardware see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk So the test masses move a whole lot less than everything around them Between the polished mirror coated front surfaces of the test masses in each arm the main laser beams are circulating Tiny imperfections of the coatings cause a tiny fraction of the laser light to be scattered out of the beams in arbitrary directions Most of the stray light hits one of many baffles and is absorbed A tiny fraction of the stray light however may hit something reflective attached to the walls which are moving relative to the test masses A tiny fraction of the reflected light may hit the nearest test mass again and get scattered back to interfere with the main beam This fraction is what ultimately shows up as glitches If the stray light path length was constant it wouldn't be a problem the backscattered light may be out of phase with the main beam but that's no different from one test mass being a tiny wee little bit in the wrong place which would be automatically corrected But since the reflecting item would be moving relative to the test mass the stray light path length will also change and the phase relationship between the backscattered light and the main beam will change If the stray light path length changes by say s which is approximately laser wavelengths per second we'll get visible noise at about Hz Moreover multiple reflections can cause the stray light path to be traversed multiple times and then we'll also get visible noise at higher frequencies stacks of parallel arches The top of an arch always corresponds to the moment when the reflecting item was moving fastest in one direction or the other relative to the test mass At moments when the motion stops and turns around the arches descend off the bottom of our images The hunt for the causes involves careful analysis of videos of the near infrared light and actively shaking the beam tubes and measuring the effects both with accelerometers mounted on the beam tubes and chambers and in the light that ultimately reaches the detection photodiodes One recent logbook entry among many is LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep continuing an investigation started in March in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep Two infrared still photos attached to comments on the latter logbook entry LIGO Livingston's X end test mass in its suspension center seen from rear left to its right is the suspended reaction mass with circular electrostatic actuator traces plated on it the angular structure on the left is the Arm Cavity Baffle All of the illumination captured here by the camera comes from stray laser light ! LLO ETMX quad https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG uploads DSCF jpeg 600x tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG uploads DSCF jpeg Those gold plated electrostatic traces used to be the reflecting item responsible for the classic multi arch Scattered Light glitches during past observing runs This has been addressed since January by more carefully steering the suspensions to keep the distance between each test mass and the reaction mass behind it very nearly constant Any remaining glitches from this path would now occur below Hz where we won't see them in our subject images Looking a little further to the left with the test mass out of view beyond the right edge we now have the Arm Cavity Baffle on the right the cryopump baffle with two glints on its right edge left of center and a on the left a rather bright double glint off a spool piece where there's a large gate valve in the X arm beam tube The corner station would be km further away at rear left !

By the way note that we don't see the main beam in these images There are more than kW of laser light circulating along earch arm between the reflecting surfaces of the input and end test masses but everything is happening inside a hard vacuum Thus there are next to no air molecules anywhere between the test masses that would scatter some light out of the beam towards the camera as they would if the beam was travelling in air https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ This is a rather common form that Scattered Light glitches from Hanford have been taking during the ongoing fourth observing run No well formed arches just wavy more or less parallel bits and fragments at frequencies mostly between and Hz sometimes with additional pieces between and Hz The band between and Hz tends to appear dark in most of our images It is blanketed by loud stationary noise which gets suppressed before our spectrogram images are created Only the loudest glitches manage to exceed the background noise in this band and show up there as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Very cool! So a lot of parts reflect just not into the recieving sensor? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Yes a lot of things inside the vacuum vessels are shiny and reflective One can't simply paint everything flat black paints don't go well with vacuum Paint molecules would evaporate drift around and settle somewhere else even on the test masses where we absolutely don't want them The baffles get special coatings of non smooth light absorbing materials and even then their edges can still reflect some light But the total area of the large vacuum chambers and long beam tubes is just too much to treat it all in this way That said the mirrors which are meant to reflect light in the intended directions are of exceedingly high quality and almost all of the light does go where it is meant to go The coatings on the end test masses reflect more than of the laser light! And the few parts per million that get through these coatings aren't wasted They are captured by additional optics behind the test masses and are used to measure the circulating light power and the beam position and angle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Very cool! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Baby koi school https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423913/ School of melted blips https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423915/ Scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423919/ School koi plus ?

There's this thing about looking at the strain channel and an auxiliary channel side by side known as "Gravity Spy 0" > All those mis labelling at a larger scale Well I can't blame the old ML for not knowing what to do with a genuinely new kind of glitch but it needs to be watched by human eyes and should not be blindly trusted to feed Gravity Spy on Zooniverse with a decent distribution of easy and less easy subjects For that matter I myself shouldn't be blindly trusted by anyone either!

This is a good question and I don't know the answer After one of the hundreds of feedback control loops that normally cooperate to maintain a good lock had failed outright when one camera monitoring the beam alignment had stopped working there were multiple unusual things going on at once By the time the present subject was recorded a couple minutes later the Livingston interferometer had already drifted so far from its intended working point that a lockloss was less than seconds away Bits and pieces of this wandering line are visible in a number of subjects from the surrounding minutes tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk I haven't seen anything similar to it in any Livingston O subjects recorded in more normal conditions Do watch out though for a Wandering Line undulating more slowly in a few dozen Hanford O subjects from last January https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3064584/ Yes Thanks to fixes applied a few years ago most of it nowadays happens below the Hz bottom edge of our spectrograms we only get to see the topmost parts of the action https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ NOTA is fine when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes This subject shows a coincidental mix of two different independent glitches The tall central feature with hints of "lighthouse" decorations could be called a Blip although it's a bit of a stretch if it had been louder it would turn into a kind of Extremely Loud The "wheatgrass" surrounding it below Hz is a form of Scattered Light rendered as rows of beatnote pulses here because this subject was processed with very fine time resolution at the expense of very coarse frequency resolution The "fins" of a Koi Fish would look somewhat similar but more symmetric and at slightly higher frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ The raw data are recorded at a rate of samples per second so frequencies up to Hz could be extracted with some distortion and up to a little beyond Hz in sufficient quality to create images like ours this isn't normally done here since it costs extra memory and processing time and most glitches don't need it I don't have a timestamp for the present subject so I can't produce another image of this particular Whistle even though the raw data from the first three observing runs are public by now but see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2079928?comment page for some other examples and illustrations! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Another great question! Some old examples aside it is safe to assume that every Gravity Spy subject from recent and ongoing observing runs contains a glitch or rarely a real gravitational wave chirp something that exceeded the ever present background noise levels by at least a factor of But that Something isn't always visible in the resulting image The Gravity Spy tools tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu come in useful here If we feed this subject number to the Similarity Search tool asking for just result suffices for this purpose we can read out the peak frequency where the noise was loudest of Hz duration of seconds and SNR signal to background noise ratio of just a little above the threshold for producing a Gravity Spy subject at all So the glitch detection software known as Omicron had seen noise at very low frequencies and had treated it as one single event encompassing both of the "blobs" we see in the fourth frame The best classification choice may be "Low Frequency Burst" although I rather think the blobs were caused by scattered light just at lower frequencies nowadays than during earlier observing runs Watch out for other NotNoGlitch subjects There are many with reported peak frequencies around or around Hz betraying a violin mode origin quite a few from Hanford at or Hz which tend to belong into a proposed new class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk some from Hanford at or Hz and more from Livingston at Hz which belong into another propopsed class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and some others https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ What happens when a participant chooses NOTA? Does it get sent to a higher level for further inspection? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ I just checked the datasets at gwosc to see if I could get the data from there but it looks like data from January to November is missing entirely? Why is this? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ First of all This is an extraneous subject there must exist another where the obvious extremely loud glitch appears properly centered I haven't seen it yet but it would probably look somewhat like tab recorded a day and a half earlier The difference in appearance is due to rendering choices coarse vs fine time resolution combined with fine vs coarse frequency resolution Why do we get such extraneous off center subjects? Mostly because the glitch detection software inspects minute long chunks of data at a time setting to work in near real time whenever another minute's worth of data has become available The "outskirts" of a loud glitch near the end of one chunk can then cause another spurious detection at the beginning of the next chunk as in this case or the onset of a loud glitch near the beginning of a fresh chunk can already have caused a spurious detection at the end of the preceding chunk Next This one did not cause a lockloss we see clean data with just the usual amount of faint random background noise everywhere in the right half of the fourth frame But similar glitches are among the loudest that a LIGO interferometer can with luck survive without losing its lock tab is one of the loudest such I've seen at an SNR above And even louder ones can cause a lockloss E this one did some seconds beyond the " s" right edge of the fourth frame ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location 942321c 415f b f png tab What causes this kind of extremely loud glitches? Ultimately earthquakes or thunderclaps or very strong gusts of wind which despite the multi stage seismic isolation manage to cause one or more of the mirror suspensions to shake The feedback control loops which keep the arm length difference "DARM" constant to within a picometer a millionth of a micrometer and those which keep the test masses mirrors at their proper angles to allow the laser light to bounce back and forth between them more than a hundred times operate in a mode with limited actuation strength and low noise once the lock has been acquired They can compensate and damp some amount of unwanted motion but not a lot When more force would be needed than is available things will momentarily depart from the proper working point resulting in a sudden LOT of noise in the data and a loudspeaker in the control room will automatically issue a verbal alert like "EX saturation!" to the operator With luck acting a little longer with the limited force available may still suffice to recover from the disturbance or it may not the lock may be lost a fast shutter closes within milliseconds to protect the detection photodiodes the input laser power is ramped down the remaining circulating laser light ends up in beam dumps and the lock would need to be reacquired slowly The saturation and lockloss illustrated above at 19T was caused by an earthquake and goes with LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep Attached to a comment on this logbook entry you'll find a plot tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG uploads L1locklosses png of some of the corrective signals sent to the test mass suspensions of the X arm "L2" refers to the penultimate mass above the test mass which is controlled by four electromagnetic coils acting on little permanent magnets on its rear side from UL Upper Left to LR Lower Right "L3" refers to the electrostatic devices acting on the test mass itself The limits are shown by dashed red lines We can see some oscillations growing until they first hit these red lines and then growing more https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ In case of a no glitch should I use the tools to see if this is really the case and then report as NOTA if there is something? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ I'll have a look at the tools I assume these should only be used when the glitch class isn't clear? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ In the long run yes or it may just be kept around until all the newly discovered glitch classes have been studied sufficiently to re train the Machine Learning and to make some of them official so that further submissions can then mark them as "one of the above" And in any case NOTA ensures that more people are going to get a look! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Because the first Observing Run of Advanced LIGO ended on and the second started on GWOSC only holds published data tab https gwosc org data that are suitable for astrophysical use thus only data that come from Observing Runs on which a careful offline noise cleaning has been performed and for which a proper calibration with robust error estimates is available and excluding short segments where one or more observatories were known to have been suffering from anomalies Engineering Runs are thus excluded weekly maintenance periods are excluded routine half hour calibration measurement periods are excluded and of course there are no data from times when the observatories weren't observing g recovering from a lockloss or weren't even running because of lengthy upgrades tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2800503?comment between observing runs https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ You mention SNR what is this a measurement of? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Ah ok so gravity spy uses all data? this subject is from https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Ah ok how accurate has the algorithm gotten so far? Anywhere I can read up on this? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ It's up to you how deeply you want to delve into each subject! Sometimes Similarity Search provides insights that aren't easy to come by in other ways Personally I am going to some extremes but I certainly don't expect everybody else to do so I will run a "NotNoGlitch" subject through a similarity search for result immediately based on the character identifier which I can already access while classifying just to see whether it belongs under Violin Modes or Low Frequency Lines or somewhere else Otherwise I'll just make a note of the subject number to return to it later I would usually add a subject to an appropriate collection only after it has been returned as a result from a small similarity search starting from another subject by which time I would also have written down the peak frequency and other metadata and eyeballed an approximate timestamp to within minutes or so and then I feed the collected subject's number back into another sim search to keep my to do queues populated I also keep track of how often each subject has appeared as a sim search result In this way I can gradually build collections of the most representative subjects of each kind Cascades of many small searches asking for rather fewer than results each time tend to work much better for exploring an underlying populations than doing only a few searches asking for many results Of course the tool being image based mixes up all the NotNoGlitch subjects https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ Signal to background Noise Ratio or in this case glitch noise level divided by background noise level https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ The "date" stamps of old subjects are dummy values reflecting the date on which the upload script was last modified Only since the fourth observing run do we have the real event date available through the nfo button Admittedly this is a little confusing but then almost all old subjects have been deactivated from the workflows in order to focus on the new material except for the gold standard subjects and for a selection of Whistles from O to make up for a total lack of Whistles from O so far The present subject dates from the first observing run and was uploaded to Zooniverse in October after results from a pilot phase of the budding project had been evaluated Subjects from later runs have the run number embedded in their titles after the observatory name https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ To be frank at the moment the Machine Learning is all over the place The glitch mix coming from the LIGO observatories during the ongoing fourth observing run differs very much from anything we've seen before and from everything the ML had previously been trained for We still have recognizable Blips and Koi Fish but Scattered Light looks very different now and there are many completely new things tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and some new things that look deceptively similar to old glitch classes that haven't reoccurred in years or whose causes have been completely eliminated in the course of observatory upgrades And changing anything in the ML takes time tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3369772?comment One fairly recent paper is Y Wu al Advancing Glitch Classification in Gravity Spy Multi view Fusion with Attention based Machine Learning for Advanced LIGO's Fourth Observing Run tab https arxiv org pdf pdf PDF arXiv gr qc You'll find this along with a selection of older material linked from Talk > Help > Resources tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk Thank you very much for your sustained interest! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Thanks for the comprehensive answer!

Just a question for my own understanding I'm aware that a fair amount of browser side Zooniverse state both PFE and FEM is cached in session storage Are cookies currently also being used for anything aside from authentication and statistics gathering? Or would this be the first use of cookies for maintaining functional state?

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2\n\n- **Vibration Eruptions**: This proposed class is described as glitches with characteristics of having shorter duration but possibly intense spikes in frequency, potentially linked to mechanical vibrations or movements within the detector setup. The motivation to define this new class stems from observations of unusual, transient bursts that don't fit into the existing models of known glitches.\n  - URL variables: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349 \n  - URL variables: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/1009409?comment_page\n\n### 2. Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n\n- Concerns were raised about the **Scattered Light** class. Citizen scientists noted that this class's characteristics appear altered in newer observations compared to previous ones. Specifically, they remarked on the visibility and behavior of arches within the scattered light glitches, suggesting a possible evolution in the cause or detection of these glitches.\n  - URL variables: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979 \n\n### 3. Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes, Sensors, or Gravitational Wave Science\n\n- Citizen scientists are deeply curious about the exact nature of changes in the **Scattered Light** glitches and how modifications to sensor setups or environmental conditions might be influencing these changes. They question how physical or operational adjustments at LIGO may be driving the observed variations in glitch signatures.  \n- Enquiries are also directed towards the educational aspects, such as how newer members can better understand the complexities of glitch categorization and the significance of each type in the broader context of gravitational wave detection.\n  - URL variables: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979 \n\n### 4. Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2\n\n- **A specific hypothesis was discussed** regarding the **Power Line (60 Hz)** glitches. It was suggested that these are caused by rapid switching of AC circuits, which transiently disrupts the line subtraction filtering, leading to characteristic glitches. This hypothesis is supported by a detailed understanding of electromechanical interactions within the detection setup, illustrating an advanced analytical approach by the citizen scientists.\n  - URL variables: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035 \n\n### 5. Questions or Thoughts Concerning Connections to Sensors or Channels\n\n- **PEM (Physical Environmental Monitoring) channels**: There are specific discussions on whether certain glitches could be better understood or categorized by correlating their occurrences with data from PEM channels. This reflects a nuanced approach to understanding the data, suggesting that different sensors or channels may offer additional insights into the origins or characteristics of certain glitches.\n  - URL variables: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349 \n\nThese points highlight the active engagement and evolving understanding of the citizen scientists in the Gravity Spy project, as they work to refine glitch classifications and deepen their knowledge of gravitational wave science.\n", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None))], created=1724893542, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_6f7679d977', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=656, prompt_tokens=24251, total_tokens=24907))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

What's less cool from a LIGO engineer's point of view is that this has been the most common type of glitch at Livingston since the beginning of the fourth observing run in May and it is still not clear how exactly these glitches arise We no longer get the sort of multi arch Scattered Light that was common in past years and that's illustrated in the Field Guide that sort was root caused in late tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and cleverly fixed in January before the end of O But we do still get stacks of Scattered Light arches shifted to somewhat lower frequencies as in this present example Most of the action is now below the Hz bottom edge of our images where it does little harm but one strong arch rises above the bottom edge to culminate near Hz and a fainter parallel arch reaches up to about Hz The two arches are separated by a darker band covering Hz punctuated by three evenly spaced streaks tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk that's a region where there's a lot of always present stationary background noise which gets suppressed before our images are created So it's a new variant of lower frequency Scattered Light but it's unclear where the scattering happens at the corner station or near one of the two test masses at the ends of the arms and it's unclear what the reflecting item is that's moving relative to the test masses https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Huh so if I understand it correctly something is moving which causes the laser to move slightly thus registering as a "quake" I don't know the appropiate terminolgy sorry and you don't yet know what exactly is moving? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Rapid cycling glitches with the tips being the loudest almost flame like with a very quiet baseline maybe suppressed in this resolution? between about and 72Hz and the tips between about and 400Hz with a frequency of about 125s between peaks https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422780/ A pair of koi fish with the heads centered at about and 0s and a blip centered at about 8s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422784/ Whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/157809/ Lfb https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423032/ Background noise much more vibrant in this one! Something weird happened here https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Yes! We're living on a restless planet Even aside from earthquakes strong enough to be felt the ground beneath our feet is always in motion at speeds of up to about a micrometer per second caused by a mix of weak distant earthquakes wind driven ocean wave activity human activity plus gusts of wind leaning on building walls which then lean on the pillars which support them which then causes the floor under the pillars to tilt a little LIGO's vacuum chambers and the beam tubes connecting them along with anything attached to the walls of the vacuum vessels follow these ground motions Inside four of the large vacuum chambers at each site there are the test masses in their four stage "quad" pendulum suspensions mounted on a three stage internal seismic isolation structure mounted in turn on a hydraulic external pre isolation For some pictures of the hardware see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk So the test masses move a whole lot less than everything around them Between the polished mirror coated front surfaces of the test masses in each arm the main laser beams are circulating Tiny imperfections of the coatings cause a tiny fraction of the laser light to be scattered out of the beams in arbitrary directions Most of the stray light hits one of many baffles and is absorbed A tiny fraction of the stray light however may hit something reflective attached to the walls which are moving relative to the test masses A tiny fraction of the reflected light may hit the nearest test mass again and get scattered back to interfere with the main beam This fraction is what ultimately shows up as glitches If the stray light path length was constant it wouldn't be a problem the backscattered light may be out of phase with the main beam but that's no different from one test mass being a tiny wee little bit in the wrong place which would be automatically corrected But since the reflecting item would be moving relative to the test mass the stray light path length will also change and the phase relationship between the backscattered light and the main beam will change If the stray light path length changes by say s which is approximately laser wavelengths per second we'll get visible noise at about Hz Moreover multiple reflections can cause the stray light path to be traversed multiple times and then we'll also get visible noise at higher frequencies stacks of parallel arches The top of an arch always corresponds to the moment when the reflecting item was moving fastest in one direction or the other relative to the test mass At moments when the motion stops and turns around the arches descend off the bottom of our images The hunt for the causes involves careful analysis of videos of the near infrared light and actively shaking the beam tubes and measuring the effects both with accelerometers mounted on the beam tubes and chambers and in the light that ultimately reaches the detection photodiodes One recent logbook entry among many is LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep continuing an investigation started in March in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep Two infrared still photos attached to comments on the latter logbook entry LIGO Livingston's X end test mass in its suspension center seen from rear left to its right is the suspended reaction mass with circular electrostatic actuator traces plated on it the angular structure on the left is the Arm Cavity Baffle All of the illumination captured here by the camera comes from stray laser light !

By the way note that we don't see the main beam in these images There are more than kW of laser light circulating along earch arm between the reflecting surfaces of the input and end test masses but everything is happening inside a hard vacuum Thus there are next to no air molecules anywhere between the test masses that would scatter some light out of the beam towards the camera as they would if the beam was travelling in air https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ This is a rather common form that Scattered Light glitches from Hanford have been taking during the ongoing fourth observing run No well formed arches just wavy more or less parallel bits and fragments at frequencies mostly between and Hz sometimes with additional pieces between and Hz The band between and Hz tends to appear dark in most of our images It is blanketed by loud stationary noise which gets suppressed before our spectrogram images are created Only the loudest glitches manage to exceed the background noise in this band and show up there as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Very cool! So a lot of parts reflect just not into the recieving sensor? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Yes a lot of things inside the vacuum vessels are shiny and reflective One can't simply paint everything flat black paints don't go well with vacuum Paint molecules would evaporate drift around and settle somewhere else even on the test masses where we absolutely don't want them The baffles get special coatings of non smooth light absorbing materials and even then their edges can still reflect some light But the total area of the large vacuum chambers and long beam tubes is just too much to treat it all in this way That said the mirrors which are meant to reflect light in the intended directions are of exceedingly high quality and almost all of the light does go where it is meant to go The coatings on the end test masses reflect more than of the laser light! And the few parts per million that get through these coatings aren't wasted They are captured by additional optics behind the test masses and are used to measure the circulating light power and the beam position and angle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Very cool! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Baby koi school https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423913/ School of melted blips https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423915/ Scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423919/ School koi plus ?

We'll see how this plays out then https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ One improvement that has been made in the new code is that you can link directly to specific workflows by workflow ID That a lot more reliable than trying to guess from user preferences eg https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy classify workflow 1610 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ At some point they will be once the detector engineers and the machine learning experts have reached a consensus about how best to address the needs At the present time it isn't even clear yet how best to carve up the glitches lately caused by scattered light into classes that are on the one hand amenable to classifying by their images limited to frequencies above Hz and to seconds' worth on the time axis and on the other hand make sense from an engineering perspective Considering the impact on clean observing time glitches which remain confined below Hz do less harm than glitches showing up at higher frequencies From this angle it might make sense to maintain the distinction between Scattered Light with arches visible above Hz and Low Frequency Burst without such even though the same causes are at work From a cause hunting angle lumping them together looks more attractive From a mitigation angle if something can be done to push the arches below Hz it would already be considered good progress and once again separate classes would help to measure the benefits And from an ML angle the current neural network is struggling to make sense of edge cases like tab or tab but also with obvious rows of arches la Livingston O ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location fd b f 4 d 84a fc png tab Upgrading and retraining the ML would help along with selecting new sets of example illustrations and of gold standard subjects along the way but would make it hard to compare future ML and volunteer classifications to existing ML and volunteer classifications of older subjects unless all the older subjects are also reprocessed and the Detector Characterization team expends extra time to familiarize themselves with the revised results So there is no easy win We've learned many lessons over the years and there are certainly things we'd do differently if we were to start over from scratch including better ways to adapt to unforeseen changes in the glitch mix For the moment we'll have to live within the limitations of the existing ML design use our human eyes and brains trained by millions of years of evolution to recognize ripe fruit and tiger stripes behind the foliage build representative collections and keep working on gradually improving the whole affair And your input is much appreciated! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ So a very large part of the noise is being removed just not everything? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Yes much is removed but not everything and especially not everything in near real time https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Pretty severe scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425841/ Huh thus is wild indeed Nice catch!

Or is it promotion to level that's not working? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Promotion to level is not working https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ A Convolutional Neural Network tab https en wikipedia org wiki Convolutional neural network ConvNN for short sometimes CNN for even shorter is a computer program which aims to simulate a network of nerve cells wired together in ways somewhat similar to those in our retinas and brain which underlie our sense of vision Among the different approaches to Machine Learning this is one particularly suited to image processing and therefore the one chosen for the Gravity Spy ML The simulated cells are arranged in layers The given image is divided into arrays of overlapping little squares The image data in each square are fed into one of the cells in the first layer Each of these input cells reacts to left right or up down or diagonal gradients brightness variations in its input square this is the "convolutional" part The outputs of the first layer cells in all sorts of combinations are processed further by the next layers Each successive layer is able to detect more complicated combinations of image traits straight or curved edges small or large uniform regions arches parallel streaks fuzziness Nessie coils After some four or five or six intermediate layers the final output layer consists of one cell for each glitch class or whatever one is trying to classify The one that "shouts most loudly" determines the label that will be attached to the image and how loudly it "shouts" compared to the others provides a confidence estimate During training the connections among the layers are strengthened or weakened at random until the outputs delivered on the training images agree reasonably well with the intended classifications This too aims to imitate how we understand learning to happen in real brains Hope this is suitably basic!

Are they useful? Are they necessary? Could we do without them? The observatory operators and the data quality team on their weekly shifts don't need them rung up violin modes are reported in other more direct ways They do add some spice to the Gravity Spy volunteer experience One more sort of thing that requires taking a closer look and extracting the peak frequency using the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search and a satisfyingly successful trip to the LIGO logbooks for corroboration But of course our personal enlightenment isn't the primary objective of the glitch detection software It is likely that they could be avoided by padding the minute long data chunks on which Omicron operates with shoulders of at least seconds on both sides my experience whilst working with the glitch plotter tab https gwo glitch plotter streamlit app has been that I needed this much padding in order for the whitening to work satisfactorily and to avoid artefacts near the beginning and end of data chunks But this would increase the latency in the time critical path for vetoing candidate events that are accompanied by glitches in safe auxiliary channels So it may be better to keep things as they are and live with these "glitches" It's worth noting that the Virgo team had encountered a very similar issue at the beginning of O tab https logbook virgo gw eu virgo ?r and tuned the padding and overlap duration for their Omicron installation in April and again in June tab https logbook virgo gw eu virgo ?r And we had seen similar evenly spaced pairs of overlapping "NotNoGlitch" subjects from Virgo O

uploaded to Zooniverse as subjects for us to inspect except that the ML gets to "view" all four frames at once side by side and without the title texts colourmap axis tick marks and labels only the four spectrogram images themselves For re training purposes it would be fed a set of around a hundred such images carefully selected and believed to be representative of a single new glitch class In reality it's somewhat more complicated The set is split up randomly into a larger part used for the training phase and a smaller part for testing validation Then the current training subset is run through the neural network adjusting the cell connections in the process and the outcome is evaluated on the current test subset while keeping the connections fixed And then this is repeated with a new random splitting of the given subject set many times until the results no longer improve in further iterations The sort of language oriented AI that has been getting headlines in the last year and a half ChatGPT and friends works completely differently though The only commonalities are that they also run on computers and also need to be trained But they require vastly larger amounts of training data and existing Large Language Models have been trained on data of sometimes extremely dubious quality not to mention copyright infringements on a global scale

over loud noise https www zooniverse org A very diffused Varnish Run fused with loud noise below symmetrical in frame https www zooniverse org Repeating diffused Varnish Run over a hill shaped loud noise rising through about Hz https www zooniverse org Not enough energy for a Blip ssp trumpetfish a Bliplet like in the mid frequencies above loud noise https www zooniverse org Varnish Run distorted at lower frequencies with an incoming larger one yet symmetrical distorting in "eyes" and "ears" Both glitches with very thin long necks perhaps those top pixels we talked about during the Trumpetfish investigation https www zooniverse org Blip escaping and from those needlelike old friends one centered https www zooniverse org Repeating Varnish Run almost two and surging Koi like in

The title subject is a rare Q rendering of a flock as is The remainder of the sim search results is something of a mixed bunch Since the choice of Q value has such a large effect on the general texture of the resulting subject images the Similarity Search tool tends to be more sensitive to the Q value than to the glitch class And since flocks at Q are rare it returns an eclectic mix of other things instead Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Whether you're browsing recent pages or viewing the results of a logbook search is specific to your current browser session and can't be exported through a URL The link you see in the URL field of your browser when you're looking at the search results ends up pointing at the logbook start page for everyone else No loss in the present case since flocks aren't momentous enough as glitches go to earn specific logbook mentions Only individual logbook entries and comments on them can be linked to directly Their URLs can be captured for pasting by using the browser's "Copy link" function on the "Link" button in the entry heading https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ Thank you for the feedback and information ZngabitanT An eclectic mix indeed as sim search sees it I took a look at the array of subjects tagged with "flock" there is a wide variety of glitches making up a flock seems pretty special > Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Yes I recalled something about this from previous logbook searches seeing that my draft post returned the Home page after having pasted the URL on top of the search results even though that search URL contained the corresponding "page 1" and "page 2" appended yet switched to the Home page when pasted into the address bar Many thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ Thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ The center object looks a bit odd https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ What is the top glitch? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ I just got promoted from gravity spy level to gravity spy level So manually promoting may have fixed it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi I would be very grateful if I could be manually promoted to Level Four as I have been on Level Three for sometime and yet Level Four is still locked Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi Brian While this is a very old glitch from I'd say that it looks like Blip ssp trumpetfish proposed https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy talk in existent since O at least The glitch here is probably mixed with a lower frequency glitch as they would frequently appear diffusing in a characteristic way the teardrop shape It might also be the next of kin Blip ssp sardine under study This is just my guess given its age This dated glitch brings back the sim search problem of duplicates where after a recent fix in this regard it no longer runs on older subjects having multiple identical copies returning the message " Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site " Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Is this scattered light ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Ah so the same glitch is still out there just with a different ID? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Tiny dot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ Hi toO Thank you for your interest If I understood correctly your question each subject has a unique subject id and then a random subject number assigned across all Zooniverse subjects As of this seeming Trumpetfish there are many subjects that fit the subclass definition each having a different subject id Yes Trumpetfish seems to be still around to date as is the case with many other classes and subclasses Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ The glitches visible in the strain channel are classic multi arch Scattered Light the kind that was still common during most of the third observing run before it got fixed in January The auxiliary channel which monitors the light circulating in the X arm represented by the few parts per million of it which make it through the mirror coatings on the end test mass and then get captured by the optics of the transmission monitoring system didn't witness it on this occasion The present S is a counterpart to S https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ Nice catch! This and similar subjects mostly from Hanford with brief sometimes repeating noise near and or around Hz are None Of The Above Sometimes we call them "Pirate Ships" by a superficial analogy with the old Virgo O glitch class of that name At Hanford they are caused by beam jitter they show up when the laser beam already wobbles sideways a little at the point where it enters the first vacuum chamber The subset near Hz got almost completely fixed in October the others still occur occasionally They are relatively rare They may yet earn a formal glitch class proposal once we've collected enough examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Another kind of None Of The Above These require a glance at the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search to read out the peak frequency Hz identifies the present subject as an example of this proposed glitch class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches from the squeezer subsystem had been present between mid November and mid January when the first half O4a of the fourth observing run ended https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ To clarify this is primarily a gold standard example of Repeating Blips intended to familiarize volunteers in the level workflow with cases where groups of individual glitchlets need to be treated as a whole and where it is essential to look at the fourth frame and take in the whole picture And I agree on the central constituent blip being slightly mis shapen because it is coincidentally blended with a bit of unrelated lower frequency noise In some cases ancient subjects that had already been uploaded once before the Gravity Spy tools existed to serve as gold standard examples were uploaded a second time later as ordinary subjects with new subject numbers and were then also added to the Similarity Search tool's database Thus Sim Search won't find the present subject under its original number but a search for the character subject id uniqueid IdrpGAG37s will succeed and will find the copy with subject number Note that the image was reprocessed for this purpose In the newer copy the image title mentions the first observing run O explicitly https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Thank you for the clarification https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ GS promotion uses a different system You need to classify in level of GS to get to level of GS so let me know if that happens or not https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ icecreamdoc I promoted you as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi Thank you for the promotion to Level I did classify on that level which did then allowed me to be promoted to do Level classifications Thanks again for all your help with this issue I really enjoy classifying the many new glitches! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Almost no background noise! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Got this error message while searching for glitches similar to the subject Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site I guess it may be related to several lockloss events happened during that day but the shape is quite weird and I cannot obtain any rather fine timestamp for this subject for further correlation to be honest I am not even sure with what can I correlate besides logbook and detector status page Anyway would be happy to know if it is normal to have some subject present on zooniverse website and missing somewhere else as well as get some tips on how to treat such examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Apologies for the invoncenience! Last year there were occasional hiccups with the subject upload process which resulted in repeated upload attempts and thus in accidental duplications and it has not been feasible to clean up completely afterwards The present glitch is one of that happened between and at Hanford cause unknown and not related to locklosses but nearly each of them was uploaded to Zooniverse five times under five different subject numbers without making it into the Gravity Spy tools before finally being successfully uploaded a sixth time The good and usable subjects from those days have numbers 9636xxxx the earlier 9287xxxx through 9343xxxx should be considered as extraneous duplicates If we were to remove them from Zooniverse now we would also orphan the associated Talk threads and produce inconsistencies in any collections containing them The usable version of the present subject is tab As to how to deal with the duplicates I would frown at them flag them as such by adding them to suitable marker collections and move on to the next subject There's also a small handful of subjects showing other kinds of glitches of which two or more copies exist in the Similarity Seach database and these can produce a different nondescript error when one asks for fewer results than the number of copies There used to be many more during O many subjects had been ingested four or five times and there was one that had got uploaded more than a thousand times those had been cleared out at one point leaving only one representative subject of each glitch Clearing out the few that exist at the present time would require a disproportionate amount of manual effort so we've left them alone https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ oki thanks for clarification! Recently I started getting glitches from this sequence one after another but was unable to find any info in Talk Btw how did you manage to find usable version of the subject in question? Definitely not by brute forcing subject IDs matching right? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Yes well observed you'll see this in a number of ancient subjects If I am not mistaken the reason is that back then well before my time the normalized noise energy was fed into the colormap as is whereas more recent subjects use the logarithm of the normalized energy which will show some finer glitch details as well as the random background more clearly Noise levels within a single subject image can vary by five orders of magnitude even after the removal of stationary noise "whitening" during preprocessing https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ One of our veteran volunteers who is currently taking a break from Zooniverse had collected almost all of these two hundred something Hz glitch subjects as they come up whilst classifying Once our systematic similarity searches across the good ones found no further examples it was a matter of looking at each of the good ones in turn find its exact copies in the twenty odd collection pages where twelve subject per page are displayed write down the relationships in an offline file and remove the copies from the bulk collection so this eyeball search became easier with each glitch that we had dealt with A few duplicates had been missed and only showed up later and these could be tied in by eyeballing the collection of good representatives which fits on pages https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Can someone shed some light on what to classify this one please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ I have seen quite a few of these "512" short lines How to classify please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ I see a few of these strong solid line at Classification same as ripple? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ I have not seen this type before Any thoughts? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

What's less cool from a LIGO engineer's point of view is that this has been the most common type of glitch at Livingston since the beginning of the fourth observing run in May and it is still not clear how exactly these glitches arise We no longer get the sort of multi arch Scattered Light that was common in past years and that's illustrated in the Field Guide that sort was root caused in late tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and cleverly fixed in January before the end of O But we do still get stacks of Scattered Light arches shifted to somewhat lower frequencies as in this present example Most of the action is now below the Hz bottom edge of our images where it does little harm but one strong arch rises above the bottom edge to culminate near Hz and a fainter parallel arch reaches up to about Hz The two arches are separated by a darker band covering Hz punctuated by three evenly spaced streaks tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk that's a region where there's a lot of always present stationary background noise which gets suppressed before our images are created So it's a new variant of lower frequency Scattered Light but it's unclear where the scattering happens at the corner station or near one of the two test masses at the ends of the arms and it's unclear what the reflecting item is that's moving relative to the test masses https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Huh so if I understand it correctly something is moving which causes the laser to move slightly thus registering as a "quake" I don't know the appropiate terminolgy sorry and you don't yet know what exactly is moving? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Rapid cycling glitches with the tips being the loudest almost flame like with a very quiet baseline maybe suppressed in this resolution? between about and 72Hz and the tips between about and 400Hz with a frequency of about 125s between peaks https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422780/ A pair of koi fish with the heads centered at about and 0s and a blip centered at about 8s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422784/ Whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/157809/ Lfb https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423032/ Background noise much more vibrant in this one! Something weird happened here https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Yes! We're living on a restless planet Even aside from earthquakes strong enough to be felt the ground beneath our feet is always in motion at speeds of up to about a micrometer per second caused by a mix of weak distant earthquakes wind driven ocean wave activity human activity plus gusts of wind leaning on building walls which then lean on the pillars which support them which then causes the floor under the pillars to tilt a little LIGO's vacuum chambers and the beam tubes connecting them along with anything attached to the walls of the vacuum vessels follow these ground motions Inside four of the large vacuum chambers at each site there are the test masses in their four stage "quad" pendulum suspensions mounted on a three stage internal seismic isolation structure mounted in turn on a hydraulic external pre isolation For some pictures of the hardware see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk So the test masses move a whole lot less than everything around them Between the polished mirror coated front surfaces of the test masses in each arm the main laser beams are circulating Tiny imperfections of the coatings cause a tiny fraction of the laser light to be scattered out of the beams in arbitrary directions Most of the stray light hits one of many baffles and is absorbed A tiny fraction of the stray light however may hit something reflective attached to the walls which are moving relative to the test masses A tiny fraction of the reflected light may hit the nearest test mass again and get scattered back to interfere with the main beam This fraction is what ultimately shows up as glitches If the stray light path length was constant it wouldn't be a problem the backscattered light may be out of phase with the main beam but that's no different from one test mass being a tiny wee little bit in the wrong place which would be automatically corrected But since the reflecting item would be moving relative to the test mass the stray light path length will also change and the phase relationship between the backscattered light and the main beam will change If the stray light path length changes by say s which is approximately laser wavelengths per second we'll get visible noise at about Hz Moreover multiple reflections can cause the stray light path to be traversed multiple times and then we'll also get visible noise at higher frequencies stacks of parallel arches The top of an arch always corresponds to the moment when the reflecting item was moving fastest in one direction or the other relative to the test mass At moments when the motion stops and turns around the arches descend off the bottom of our images The hunt for the causes involves careful analysis of videos of the near infrared light and actively shaking the beam tubes and measuring the effects both with accelerometers mounted on the beam tubes and chambers and in the light that ultimately reaches the detection photodiodes One recent logbook entry among many is LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep continuing an investigation started in March in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep Two infrared still photos attached to comments on the latter logbook entry LIGO Livingston's X end test mass in its suspension center seen from rear left to its right is the suspended reaction mass with circular electrostatic actuator traces plated on it the angular structure on the left is the Arm Cavity Baffle All of the illumination captured here by the camera comes from stray laser light ! LLO ETMX quad https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG uploads DSCF jpeg 600x tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG uploads DSCF jpeg Those gold plated electrostatic traces used to be the reflecting item responsible for the classic multi arch Scattered Light glitches during past observing runs This has been addressed since January by more carefully steering the suspensions to keep the distance between each test mass and the reaction mass behind it very nearly constant Any remaining glitches from this path would now occur below Hz where we won't see them in our subject images Looking a little further to the left with the test mass out of view beyond the right edge we now have the Arm Cavity Baffle on the right the cryopump baffle with two glints on its right edge left of center and a on the left a rather bright double glint off a spool piece where there's a large gate valve in the X arm beam tube The corner station would be km further away at rear left !

By the way note that we don't see the main beam in these images There are more than kW of laser light circulating along earch arm between the reflecting surfaces of the input and end test masses but everything is happening inside a hard vacuum Thus there are next to no air molecules anywhere between the test masses that would scatter some light out of the beam towards the camera as they would if the beam was travelling in air https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ This is a rather common form that Scattered Light glitches from Hanford have been taking during the ongoing fourth observing run No well formed arches just wavy more or less parallel bits and fragments at frequencies mostly between and Hz sometimes with additional pieces between and Hz The band between and Hz tends to appear dark in most of our images It is blanketed by loud stationary noise which gets suppressed before our spectrogram images are created Only the loudest glitches manage to exceed the background noise in this band and show up there as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Very cool! So a lot of parts reflect just not into the recieving sensor? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Yes a lot of things inside the vacuum vessels are shiny and reflective One can't simply paint everything flat black paints don't go well with vacuum Paint molecules would evaporate drift around and settle somewhere else even on the test masses where we absolutely don't want them The baffles get special coatings of non smooth light absorbing materials and even then their edges can still reflect some light But the total area of the large vacuum chambers and long beam tubes is just too much to treat it all in this way That said the mirrors which are meant to reflect light in the intended directions are of exceedingly high quality and almost all of the light does go where it is meant to go The coatings on the end test masses reflect more than of the laser light! And the few parts per million that get through these coatings aren't wasted They are captured by additional optics behind the test masses and are used to measure the circulating light power and the beam position and angle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Very cool! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Baby koi school https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423913/ School of melted blips https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423915/ Scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423919/ School koi plus ?

We'll see how this plays out then https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ One improvement that has been made in the new code is that you can link directly to specific workflows by workflow ID That a lot more reliable than trying to guess from user preferences eg https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy classify workflow 1610 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ At some point they will be once the detector engineers and the machine learning experts have reached a consensus about how best to address the needs At the present time it isn't even clear yet how best to carve up the glitches lately caused by scattered light into classes that are on the one hand amenable to classifying by their images limited to frequencies above Hz and to seconds' worth on the time axis and on the other hand make sense from an engineering perspective Considering the impact on clean observing time glitches which remain confined below Hz do less harm than glitches showing up at higher frequencies From this angle it might make sense to maintain the distinction between Scattered Light with arches visible above Hz and Low Frequency Burst without such even though the same causes are at work From a cause hunting angle lumping them together looks more attractive From a mitigation angle if something can be done to push the arches below Hz it would already be considered good progress and once again separate classes would help to measure the benefits And from an ML angle the current neural network is struggling to make sense of edge cases like tab or tab but also with obvious rows of arches la Livingston O ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location fd b f 4 d 84a fc png tab Upgrading and retraining the ML would help along with selecting new sets of example illustrations and of gold standard subjects along the way but would make it hard to compare future ML and volunteer classifications to existing ML and volunteer classifications of older subjects unless all the older subjects are also reprocessed and the Detector Characterization team expends extra time to familiarize themselves with the revised results So there is no easy win We've learned many lessons over the years and there are certainly things we'd do differently if we were to start over from scratch including better ways to adapt to unforeseen changes in the glitch mix For the moment we'll have to live within the limitations of the existing ML design use our human eyes and brains trained by millions of years of evolution to recognize ripe fruit and tiger stripes behind the foliage build representative collections and keep working on gradually improving the whole affair And your input is much appreciated! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ So a very large part of the noise is being removed just not everything? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Yes much is removed but not everything and especially not everything in near real time https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Pretty severe scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425841/ Huh thus is wild indeed Nice catch!

Are they useful? Are they necessary? Could we do without them? The observatory operators and the data quality team on their weekly shifts don't need them rung up violin modes are reported in other more direct ways They do add some spice to the Gravity Spy volunteer experience One more sort of thing that requires taking a closer look and extracting the peak frequency using the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search and a satisfyingly successful trip to the LIGO logbooks for corroboration But of course our personal enlightenment isn't the primary objective of the glitch detection software It is likely that they could be avoided by padding the minute long data chunks on which Omicron operates with shoulders of at least seconds on both sides my experience whilst working with the glitch plotter tab https gwo glitch plotter streamlit app has been that I needed this much padding in order for the whitening to work satisfactorily and to avoid artefacts near the beginning and end of data chunks But this would increase the latency in the time critical path for vetoing candidate events that are accompanied by glitches in safe auxiliary channels So it may be better to keep things as they are and live with these "glitches" It's worth noting that the Virgo team had encountered a very similar issue at the beginning of O tab https logbook virgo gw eu virgo ?r and tuned the padding and overlap duration for their Omicron installation in April and again in June tab https logbook virgo gw eu virgo ?r And we had seen similar evenly spaced pairs of overlapping "NotNoGlitch" subjects from Virgo O

uploaded to Zooniverse as subjects for us to inspect except that the ML gets to "view" all four frames at once side by side and without the title texts colourmap axis tick marks and labels only the four spectrogram images themselves For re training purposes it would be fed a set of around a hundred such images carefully selected and believed to be representative of a single new glitch class In reality it's somewhat more complicated The set is split up randomly into a larger part used for the training phase and a smaller part for testing validation Then the current training subset is run through the neural network adjusting the cell connections in the process and the outcome is evaluated on the current test subset while keeping the connections fixed And then this is repeated with a new random splitting of the given subject set many times until the results no longer improve in further iterations The sort of language oriented AI that has been getting headlines in the last year and a half ChatGPT and friends works completely differently though The only commonalities are that they also run on computers and also need to be trained But they require vastly larger amounts of training

The title subject is a rare Q rendering of a flock as is The remainder of the sim search results is something of a mixed bunch Since the choice of Q value has such a large effect on the general texture of the resulting subject images the Similarity Search tool tends to be more sensitive to the Q value than to the glitch class And since flocks at Q are rare it returns an eclectic mix of other things instead Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Whether you're browsing recent pages or viewing the results of a logbook search is specific to your current browser session and can't be exported through a URL The link you see in the URL field of your browser when you're looking at the search results ends up pointing at the logbook start page for everyone else No loss in the present case since flocks aren't momentous enough as glitches go to earn specific logbook mentions Only individual logbook entries and comments on them can be linked to directly Their URLs can be captured for pasting by using the browser's "Copy link" function on the "Link" button in the entry heading https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ Thank you for the feedback and information ZngabitanT An eclectic mix indeed as sim search sees it I took a look at the array of subjects tagged with "flock" there is a wide variety of glitches making up a flock seems pretty special > Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Yes I recalled something about this from previous logbook searches seeing that my draft post returned the Home page after having pasted the URL on top of the search results even though that search URL contained the corresponding "page 1" and "page 2" appended yet switched to the Home page when pasted into the address bar Many thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ Thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ The center object looks a bit odd https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ What is the top glitch? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ I just got promoted from gravity spy level to gravity spy level So manually promoting may have fixed it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi I would be very grateful if I could be manually promoted to Level Four as I have been on Level Three for sometime and yet Level Four is still locked Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi Brian While this is a very old glitch from I'd say that it looks like Blip ssp trumpetfish proposed https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy talk in existent since O at least The glitch here is probably mixed with a lower frequency glitch as they would frequently appear diffusing in a characteristic way the teardrop shape It might also be the next of kin Blip ssp sardine under study This is just my guess given its age This dated glitch brings back the sim search problem of duplicates where after a recent fix in this regard it no longer runs on older subjects having multiple identical copies returning the message " Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site " Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Is this scattered light ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Ah so the same glitch is still out there just with a different ID? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Tiny dot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ Hi toO Thank you for your interest If I understood correctly your question each subject has a unique subject id and then a random subject number assigned across all Zooniverse subjects As of this seeming Trumpetfish there are many subjects that fit the subclass definition each having a different subject id Yes Trumpetfish seems to be still around to date as is the case with many other classes and subclasses Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ The glitches visible in the strain channel are classic multi arch Scattered Light the kind that was still common during most of the third observing run before it got fixed in January The auxiliary channel which monitors the light circulating in the X arm represented by the few parts per million of it which make it through the mirror coatings on the end test mass and then get captured by the optics of the transmission monitoring system didn't witness it on this occasion The present S is a counterpart to S https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ Nice catch! This and similar subjects mostly from Hanford with brief sometimes repeating noise near and or around Hz are None Of The Above Sometimes we call them "Pirate Ships" by a superficial analogy with the old Virgo O glitch class of that name At Hanford they are caused by beam jitter they show up when the laser beam already wobbles sideways a little at the point where it enters the first vacuum chamber The subset near Hz got almost completely fixed in October the others still occur occasionally They are relatively rare They may yet earn a formal glitch class proposal once we've collected enough examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Another kind of None Of The Above These require a glance at the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search to read out the peak frequency Hz identifies the present subject as an example of this proposed glitch class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches from the squeezer subsystem had been present between mid November and mid January when the first half O4a of the fourth observing run ended https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ To clarify this is primarily a gold standard example of Repeating Blips intended to familiarize volunteers in the level workflow with cases where groups of individual glitchlets need to be treated as a whole and where it is essential to look at the fourth frame and take in the whole picture And I agree on the central constituent blip being slightly mis shapen because it is coincidentally blended with a bit of unrelated lower frequency noise In some cases ancient subjects that had already been uploaded once before the Gravity Spy tools existed to serve as gold standard examples were uploaded a second time later as ordinary subjects with new subject numbers and were then also added to the Similarity Search tool's database Thus Sim Search won't find the present subject under its original number but a search for the character subject id uniqueid IdrpGAG37s will succeed and will find the copy with subject number Note that the image was reprocessed for this purpose In the newer copy the image title mentions the first observing run O explicitly https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Thank you for the clarification https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ GS promotion uses a different system You need to classify in level of GS to get to level of GS so let me know if that happens or not https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ icecreamdoc I promoted you as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi Thank you for the promotion to Level I did classify on that level which did then allowed me to be promoted to do Level classifications Thanks again for all your help with this issue I really enjoy classifying the many new glitches! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Almost no background noise! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Got this error message while searching for glitches similar to the subject Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site I guess it may be related to several lockloss events happened during that day but the shape is quite weird and I cannot obtain any rather fine timestamp for this subject for further correlation to be honest I am not even sure with what can I correlate besides logbook and detector status page Anyway would be happy to know if it is normal to have some subject present on zooniverse website and missing somewhere else as well as get some tips on how to treat such examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Apologies for the invoncenience! Last year there were occasional hiccups with the subject upload process which resulted in repeated upload attempts and thus in accidental duplications and it has not been feasible to clean up completely afterwards The present glitch is one of that happened between and at Hanford cause unknown and not related to locklosses but nearly each of them was uploaded to Zooniverse five times under five different subject numbers without making it into the Gravity Spy tools before finally being successfully uploaded a sixth time The good and usable subjects from those days have numbers 9636xxxx the earlier 9287xxxx through 9343xxxx should be considered as extraneous duplicates If we were to remove them from Zooniverse now we would also orphan the associated Talk threads and produce inconsistencies in any collections containing them The usable version of the present subject is tab As to how to deal with the duplicates I would frown at them flag them as such by adding them to suitable marker collections and move on to the next subject There's also a small handful of subjects showing other kinds of glitches of which two or more copies exist in the Similarity Seach database and these can produce a different nondescript error when one asks for fewer results than the number of copies There used to be many more during O many subjects had been ingested four or five times and there was one that had got uploaded more than a thousand times those had been cleared out at one point leaving only one representative subject of each glitch Clearing out the few that exist at the present time would require a disproportionate amount of manual effort so we've left them alone https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ oki thanks for clarification! Recently I started getting glitches from this sequence one after another but was unable to find any info in Talk Btw how did you manage to find usable version of the subject in question? Definitely not by brute forcing subject IDs matching right? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Yes well observed you'll see this in a number of ancient subjects If I am not mistaken the reason is that back then well before my time the normalized noise energy was fed into the colormap as is whereas more recent subjects use the logarithm of the normalized energy which will show some finer glitch details as well as the random background more clearly Noise levels within a single subject image can vary by five orders of magnitude even after the removal of stationary noise "whitening" during preprocessing https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ One of our veteran volunteers who is currently taking a break from Zooniverse had collected almost all of these two hundred something Hz glitch subjects as they come up whilst classifying Once our systematic similarity searches across the good ones found no further examples it was a matter of looking at each of the good ones in turn find its exact copies in the twenty odd collection pages where twelve subject per page are displayed write down the relationships in an offline file and remove the copies from the bulk collection so this eyeball search became easier with each glitch that we had dealt with A few duplicates had been missed and only showed up later and these could be tied in by eyeballing the collection of good representatives which fits on pages https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Can someone shed some light on what to classify this one please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ I have seen quite a few of these "512" short lines How to classify please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ I see a few of these strong solid line at Classification same as ripple? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ I have not seen this type before Any thoughts? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The discussion suggests that these might have similarities with "Cairn" but manifest under different conditions, possibly with larger amplitudes.\n   - **Invisible Violins**: Classified under "Violin Mode Harmonics," these are differentiated as not visually apparent but detectable by their influence on the system. It\'s suggested that these represent elevated noise levels or anomalies within the detection system rather than external influences. \n   - **Pirate Ships**: Mentioned as a potential new class, these are attributed to beam jitter causing disturbances that appear as glitches. They are described as being caused by sideway wobbles of the laser beam at the entry point of the vacuum chamber.\n   - URLs influencing the response:\n     - For Vibration Eruptions: `https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/1009409?comment`\n     - For Invisible Violins: `https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271`\n     - For Pirate Ships: `https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184`\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - Concerns about the classification of "Scattered Light" glitches are evident, with discussions around the updating of examples to reflect less obvious arching patterns in newer observations. This suggests a possible evolution in the appearance of this glitch class over time.\n   - URLs influencing the response: \n     - For Scattered Light: `https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979`\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science:**\n   - Questions about the categorization of glitches and their detailed characteristics show an active pursuit of deeper understanding. For instance, discussions about whether a "blip" could appear as a "chirp" due to coarse time resolution indicate a curiosity about how data processing impacts glitch identification.\n   - URLs influencing the response: \n     - For blip/chirp confusion: `https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426474`\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins:**\n   - A hypothesis mentioned involves the impact of environmental conditions like storms and their correlation with observed glitches.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk Dataset 1:
     Good question well there are certainly Scattered Light bits of arches present g at right stage left in frame The brightest feature though might perhaps be something else There's a slight excess of similar looking Hanford subjects from May with this peak frequency and I'm not at all sure yet what to make of them https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3419543/ I will look out for these https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3419543/ Flock When does O begin? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3419832/ Tomte bli???

What's less cool from a LIGO engineer's point of view is that this has been the most common type of glitch at Livingston since the beginning of the fourth observing run in May and it is still not clear how exactly these glitches arise We no longer get the sort of multi arch Scattered Light that was common in past years and that's illustrated in the Field Guide that sort was root caused in late tab https alog ligo wa caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep and cleverly fixed in January before the end of O But we do still get stacks of Scattered Light arches shifted to somewhat lower frequencies as in this present example Most of the action is now below the Hz bottom edge of our images where it does little harm but one strong arch rises above the bottom edge to culminate near Hz and a fainter parallel arch reaches up to about Hz The two arches are separated by a darker band covering Hz punctuated by three evenly spaced streaks tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk that's a region where there's a lot of always present stationary background noise which gets suppressed before our images are created So it's a new variant of lower frequency Scattered Light but it's unclear where the scattering happens at the corner station or near one of the two test masses at the ends of the arms and it's unclear what the reflecting item is that's moving relative to the test masses https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Huh so if I understand it correctly something is moving which causes the laser to move slightly thus registering as a "quake" I don't know the appropiate terminolgy sorry and you don't yet know what exactly is moving? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Rapid cycling glitches with the tips being the loudest almost flame like with a very quiet baseline maybe suppressed in this resolution? between about and 72Hz and the tips between about and 400Hz with a frequency of about 125s between peaks https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422780/ A pair of koi fish with the heads centered at about and 0s and a blip centered at about 8s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422784/ Whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/157809/ Lfb https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423032/ Background noise much more vibrant in this one! Something weird happened here https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Yes! We're living on a restless planet Even aside from earthquakes strong enough to be felt the ground beneath our feet is always in motion at speeds of up to about a micrometer per second caused by a mix of weak distant earthquakes wind driven ocean wave activity human activity plus gusts of wind leaning on building walls which then lean on the pillars which support them which then causes the floor under the pillars to tilt a little LIGO's vacuum chambers and the beam tubes connecting them along with anything attached to the walls of the vacuum vessels follow these ground motions Inside four of the large vacuum chambers at each site there are the test masses in their four stage "quad" pendulum suspensions mounted on a three stage internal seismic isolation structure mounted in turn on a hydraulic external pre isolation For some pictures of the hardware see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk So the test masses move a whole lot less than everything around them Between the polished mirror coated front surfaces of the test masses in each arm the main laser beams are circulating Tiny imperfections of the coatings cause a tiny fraction of the laser light to be scattered out of the beams in arbitrary directions Most of the stray light hits one of many baffles and is absorbed A tiny fraction of the stray light however may hit something reflective attached to the walls which are moving relative to the test masses A tiny fraction of the reflected light may hit the nearest test mass again and get scattered back to interfere with the main beam This fraction is what ultimately shows up as glitches If the stray light path length was constant it wouldn't be a problem the backscattered light may be out of phase with the main beam but that's no different from one test mass being a tiny wee little bit in the wrong place which would be automatically corrected But since the reflecting item would be moving relative to the test mass the stray light path length will also change and the phase relationship between the backscattered light and the main beam will change If the stray light path length changes by say s which is approximately laser wavelengths per second we'll get visible noise at about Hz Moreover multiple reflections can cause the stray light path to be traversed multiple times and then we'll also get visible noise at higher frequencies stacks of parallel arches The top of an arch always corresponds to the moment when the reflecting item was moving fastest in one direction or the other relative to the test mass At moments when the motion stops and turns around the arches descend off the bottom of our images The hunt for the causes involves careful analysis of videos of the near infrared light and actively shaking the beam tubes and measuring the effects both with accelerometers mounted on the beam tubes and chambers and in the light that ultimately reaches the detection photodiodes One recent logbook entry among many is LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep continuing an investigation started in March in LLO tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG index php?callRep Two infrared still photos attached to comments on the latter logbook entry LIGO Livingston's X end test mass in its suspension center seen from rear left to its right is the suspended reaction mass with circular electrostatic actuator traces plated on it the angular structure on the left is the Arm Cavity Baffle All of the illumination captured here by the camera comes from stray laser light ! LLO ETMX quad https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG uploads DSCF jpeg 600x tab https alog ligo la caltech edu aLOG uploads DSCF jpeg Those gold plated electrostatic traces used to be the reflecting item responsible for the classic multi arch Scattered Light glitches during past observing runs This has been addressed since January by more carefully steering the suspensions to keep the distance between each test mass and the reaction mass behind it very nearly constant Any remaining glitches from this path would now occur below Hz where we won't see them in our subject images Looking a little further to the left with the test mass out of view beyond the right edge we now have the Arm Cavity Baffle on the right the cryopump baffle with two glints on its right edge left of center and a on the left a rather bright double glint off a spool piece where there's a large gate valve in the X arm beam tube The corner station would be km further away at rear left !

By the way note that we don't see the main beam in these images There are more than kW of laser light circulating along earch arm between the reflecting surfaces of the input and end test masses but everything is happening inside a hard vacuum Thus there are next to no air molecules anywhere between the test masses that would scatter some light out of the beam towards the camera as they would if the beam was travelling in air https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ This is a rather common form that Scattered Light glitches from Hanford have been taking during the ongoing fourth observing run No well formed arches just wavy more or less parallel bits and fragments at frequencies mostly between and Hz sometimes with additional pieces between and Hz The band between and Hz tends to appear dark in most of our images It is blanketed by loud stationary noise which gets suppressed before our spectrogram images are created Only the loudest glitches manage to exceed the background noise in this band and show up there as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Very cool! So a lot of parts reflect just not into the recieving sensor? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Yes a lot of things inside the vacuum vessels are shiny and reflective One can't simply paint everything flat black paints don't go well with vacuum Paint molecules would evaporate drift around and settle somewhere else even on the test masses where we absolutely don't want them The baffles get special coatings of non smooth light absorbing materials and even then their edges can still reflect some light But the total area of the large vacuum chambers and long beam tubes is just too much to treat it all in this way That said the mirrors which are meant to reflect light in the intended directions are of exceedingly high quality and almost all of the light does go where it is meant to go The coatings on the end test masses reflect more than of the laser light! And the few parts per million that get through these coatings aren't wasted They are captured by additional optics behind the test masses and are used to measure the circulating light power and the beam position and angle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Very cool! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Baby koi school https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423913/ School of melted blips https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423915/ Scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423919/ School koi plus ?

We'll see how this plays out then https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ One improvement that has been made in the new code is that you can link directly to specific workflows by workflow ID That a lot more reliable than trying to guess from user preferences eg https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy classify workflow 1610 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ At some point they will be once the detector engineers and the machine learning experts have reached a consensus about how best to address the needs At the present time it isn't even clear yet how best to carve up the glitches lately caused by scattered light into classes that are on the one hand amenable to classifying by their images limited to frequencies above Hz and to seconds' worth on the time axis and on the other hand make sense from an engineering perspective Considering the impact on clean observing time glitches which remain confined below Hz do less harm than glitches showing up at higher frequencies From this angle it might make sense to maintain the distinction between Scattered Light with arches visible above Hz and Low Frequency Burst without such even though the same causes are at work From a cause hunting angle lumping them together looks more attractive From a mitigation angle if something can be done to push the arches below Hz it would already be considered good progress and once again separate classes would help to measure the benefits And from an ML angle the current neural network is struggling to make sense of edge cases like tab or tab but also with obvious rows of arches la Livingston O ! frame https thumbnails zooniverse org 300x panoptes uploads zooniverse org subject location fd b f 4 d 84a fc png tab Upgrading and retraining the ML would help along with selecting new sets of example illustrations and of gold standard subjects along the way but would make it hard to compare future ML and volunteer classifications to existing ML and volunteer classifications of older subjects unless all the older subjects are also reprocessed and the Detector Characterization team expends extra time to familiarize themselves with the revised results So there is no easy win We've learned many lessons over the years and there are certainly things we'd do differently if we were to start over from scratch including better ways to adapt to unforeseen changes in the glitch mix For the moment we'll have to live within the limitations of the existing ML design use our human eyes and brains trained by millions of years of evolution to recognize ripe fruit and tiger stripes behind the foliage build representative collections and keep working on gradually improving the whole affair And your input is much appreciated! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ So a very large part of the noise is being removed just not everything? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Yes much is removed but not everything and especially not everything in near real time https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Pretty severe scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425841/ Huh thus is wild indeed Nice catch!

Are they useful? Are they necessary? Could we do without them? The observatory operators and the data quality team on their weekly shifts don't need them rung up violin modes are reported in other more direct ways They do add some spice to the Gravity Spy volunteer experience One more sort of thing that requires taking a closer look and extracting the peak frequency using the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search and a satisfyingly successful trip to the LIGO logbooks for corroboration But of course our personal enlightenment isn't the primary objective of the glitch detection software It is likely that they could be avoided by padding the minute long data chunks on which Omicron operates with shoulders of at least seconds on both sides my experience whilst working with the glitch plotter tab https gwo glitch plotter streamlit app has been that I needed this much padding in order for the whitening to work satisfactorily and to avoid artefacts near the beginning and end of data chunks But this would increase the latency in the time critical path for vetoing candidate events that are accompanied by glitches in safe auxiliary channels So it may be better to keep things as they are and live with these "glitches" It's worth noting that the Virgo team had encountered a very similar issue at the beginning of O tab https logbook virgo gw eu virgo ?r and tuned the padding and overlap duration for their Omicron installation in April and again in June tab https logbook virgo gw eu virgo ?r And we had seen similar evenly spaced pairs of overlapping "NotNoGlitch" subjects from Virgo O

uploaded to Zooniverse as subjects for us to inspect except that the ML gets to "view" all four frames at once side by side and without the title texts colourmap axis tick marks and labels only the four spectrogram images themselves For re training purposes it would be fed a set of around a hundred such images carefully selected and believed to be representative of a single new glitch class In reality it's somewhat more complicated The set is split up randomly into a larger part used for the training phase and a smaller part for testing validation Then the current training subset is run through the neural network adjusting the cell connections in the process and the outcome is evaluated on the current test subset while keeping the connections fixed And then this is repeated with a new random splitting of the given subject set many times until the results no longer improve in further iterations The sort of language oriented AI that has been getting headlines in the last year and a half ChatGPT and friends works completely differently though The only commonalities are that they also run on computers and also need to be trained But they require vastly larger amounts of training

The title subject is a rare Q rendering of a flock as is The remainder of the sim search results is something of a mixed bunch Since the choice of Q value has such a large effect on the general texture of the resulting subject images the Similarity Search tool tends to be more sensitive to the Q value than to the glitch class And since flocks at Q are rare it returns an eclectic mix of other things instead Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Whether you're browsing recent pages or viewing the results of a logbook search is specific to your current browser session and can't be exported through a URL The link you see in the URL field of your browser when you're looking at the search results ends up pointing at the logbook start page for everyone else No loss in the present case since flocks aren't momentous enough as glitches go to earn specific logbook mentions Only individual logbook entries and comments on them can be linked to directly Their URLs can be captured for pasting by using the browser's "Copy link" function on the "Link" button in the entry heading https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ Thank you for the feedback and information ZngabitanT An eclectic mix indeed as sim search sees it I took a look at the array of subjects tagged with "flock" there is a wide variety of glitches making up a flock seems pretty special > Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Yes I recalled something about this from previous logbook searches seeing that my draft post returned the Home page after having pasted the URL on top of the search results even though that search URL contained the corresponding "page 1" and "page 2" appended yet switched to the Home page when pasted into the address bar Many thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ Thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ The center object looks a bit odd https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ What is the top glitch? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ I just got promoted from gravity spy level to gravity spy level So manually promoting may have fixed it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi I would be very grateful if I could be manually promoted to Level Four as I have been on Level Three for sometime and yet Level Four is still locked Thank you Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi Brian While this is a very old glitch from I'd say that it looks like Blip ssp trumpetfish proposed https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy talk in existent since O at least The glitch here is probably mixed with a lower frequency glitch as they would frequently appear diffusing in a characteristic way the teardrop shape It might also be the next of kin Blip ssp sardine under study This is just my guess given its age This dated glitch brings back the sim search problem of duplicates where after a recent fix in this regard it no longer runs on older subjects having multiple identical copies returning the message " Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site " Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Is this scattered light ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Ah so the same glitch is still out there just with a different ID? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Tiny dot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ Hi toO Thank you for your interest If I understood correctly your question each subject has a unique subject id and then a random subject number assigned across all Zooniverse subjects As of this seeming Trumpetfish there are many subjects that fit the subclass definition each having a different subject id Yes Trumpetfish seems to be still around to date as is the case with many other classes and subclasses Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ The glitches visible in the strain channel are classic multi arch Scattered Light the kind that was still common during most of the third observing run before it got fixed in January The auxiliary channel which monitors the light circulating in the X arm represented by the few parts per million of it which make it through the mirror coatings on the end test mass and then get captured by the optics of the transmission monitoring system didn't witness it on this occasion The present S is a counterpart to S https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ Nice catch! This and similar subjects mostly from Hanford with brief sometimes repeating noise near and or around Hz are None Of The Above Sometimes we call them "Pirate Ships" by a superficial analogy with the old Virgo O glitch class of that name At Hanford they are caused by beam jitter they show up when the laser beam already wobbles sideways a little at the point where it enters the first vacuum chamber The subset near Hz got almost completely fixed in October the others still occur occasionally They are relatively rare They may yet earn a formal glitch class proposal once we've collected enough examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Another kind of None Of The Above These require a glance at the Similarity Search tool tab https gravityspytools ciera northwestern edu search to read out the peak frequency Hz identifies the present subject as an example of this proposed glitch class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk These glitches from the squeezer subsystem had been present between mid November and mid January when the first half O4a of the fourth observing run ended https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ To clarify this is primarily a gold standard example of Repeating Blips intended to familiarize volunteers in the level workflow with cases where groups of individual glitchlets need to be treated as a whole and where it is essential to look at the fourth frame and take in the whole picture And I agree on the central constituent blip being slightly mis shapen because it is coincidentally blended with a bit of unrelated lower frequency noise In some cases ancient subjects that had already been uploaded once before the Gravity Spy tools existed to serve as gold standard examples were uploaded a second time later as ordinary subjects with new subject numbers and were then also added to the Similarity Search tool's database Thus Sim Search won't find the present subject under its original number but a search for the character subject id uniqueid IdrpGAG37s will succeed and will find the copy with subject number Note that the image was reprocessed for this purpose In the newer copy the image title mentions the first observing run O explicitly https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Thank you for the clarification https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ GS promotion uses a different system You need to classify in level of GS to get to level of GS so let me know if that happens or not https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ icecreamdoc I promoted you as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi Thank you for the promotion to Level I did classify on that level which did then allowed me to be promoted to do Level classifications Thanks again for all your help with this issue I really enjoy classifying the many new glitches! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Almost no background noise! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Got this error message while searching for glitches similar to the subject Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site I guess it may be related to several lockloss events happened during that day but the shape is quite weird and I cannot obtain any rather fine timestamp for this subject for further correlation to be honest I am not even sure with what can I correlate besides logbook and detector status page Anyway would be happy to know if it is normal to have some subject present on zooniverse website and missing somewhere else as well as get some tips on how to treat such examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Apologies for the invoncenience! Last year there were occasional hiccups with the subject upload process which resulted in repeated upload attempts and thus in accidental duplications and it has not been feasible to clean up completely afterwards The present glitch is one of that happened between and at Hanford cause unknown and not related to locklosses but nearly each of them was uploaded to Zooniverse five times under five different subject numbers without making it into the Gravity Spy tools before finally being successfully uploaded a sixth time The good and usable subjects from those days have numbers 9636xxxx the earlier 9287xxxx through 9343xxxx should be considered as extraneous duplicates If we were to remove them from Zooniverse now we would also orphan the associated Talk threads and produce inconsistencies in any collections containing them The usable version of the present subject is tab As to how to deal with the duplicates I would frown at them flag them as such by adding them to suitable marker collections and move on to the next subject There's also a small handful of subjects showing other kinds of glitches of which two or more copies exist in the Similarity Seach database and these can produce a different nondescript error when one asks for fewer results than the number of copies There used to be many more during O many subjects had been ingested four or five times and there was one that had got uploaded more than a thousand times those had been cleared out at one point leaving only one representative subject of each glitch Clearing out the few that exist at the present time would require a disproportionate amount of manual effort so we've left them alone https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ oki thanks for clarification! Recently I started getting glitches from this sequence one after another but was unable to find any info in Talk Btw how did you manage to find usable version of the subject in question? Definitely not by brute forcing subject IDs matching right? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Yes well observed you'll see this in a number of ancient subjects If I am not mistaken the reason is that back then well before my time the normalized noise energy was fed into the colormap as is whereas more recent subjects use the logarithm of the normalized energy which will show some finer glitch details as well as the random background more clearly Noise levels within a single subject image can vary by five orders of magnitude even after the removal of stationary noise "whitening" during preprocessing https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ One of our veteran volunteers who is currently taking a break from Zooniverse had collected almost all of these two hundred something Hz glitch subjects as they come up whilst classifying Once our systematic similarity searches across the good ones found no further examples it was a matter of looking at each of the good ones in turn find its exact copies in the twenty odd collection pages where twelve subject per page are displayed write down the relationships in an offline file and remove the copies from the bulk collection so this eyeball search became easier with each glitch that we had dealt with A few duplicates had been missed and only showed up later and these could be tied in by eyeballing the collection of good representatives which fits on pages https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Can someone shed some light on what to classify this one please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ I have seen quite a few of these "512" short lines How to classify please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ I see a few of these strong solid line at Classification same as ripple? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ I have not seen this type before Any thoughts? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.
    
GRAVITYBOT RESPONSE:
ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-A4FfLInXh1zQPtX3F6o25hixjRmQ3', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='1. **New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - One of the new glitch classes discussed in Talk Dataset 2 is the "Vibration Eruptions" class. This class is recognized for its resonance near 70 Hz, which appears distinctly from the auxiliary optics\' bounce mode resonance that also occurs near this frequency. The proposed glitch class is noted for its potential confusion with other glitch types due to its unique frequency characteristics. \n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, concerns are raised about the "Scattered Light" glitch class. Participants question if the existing examples in the glitch classification guide are outdated, as the arches characteristic of scattered light are not as obvious as before. This prompts discussions on whether the selection examples for identifying these glitches should be updated to reflect their current appearances in the sensor data.\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science:**\n   - Questions in Talk Dataset 2 delve deeper into the technical aspects, such as what constitutes a glitch class and how subclasses within a broader category might differ in spectral characteristics. For instance, participants explore the differences between "Blip ssp Trumpetfish" and "Blip ssp Sardine" to understand subtle variations in glitch manifestations. There is also a curiosity about how machine learning models categorize and learn from these glitches, showing an advanced level of engagement and understanding.\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, specific hypotheses about glitch origins include environmental influences such as local electrification impacting the "Power Line" glitches. There’s analytical discussion that these glitches may result from current circuit switching that the line subtraction filtering fails to quickly adapt to. These insights show a deeper analysis of how external conditions could directly affect the data quality and glitch appearance.\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Specific Sensors or Channels:**\n   - Talk Dataset 2 contains discussions about whether certain sensors or channels at the LIGO observatories might be more susceptible to specific types of glitches. For example, conversations about whether the Hanford or Livingston observatories record certain types of glitches more frequently, or discussions on the performance differences between various channels, suggest a nuanced understanding of the instrumental setup and its implications on data quality. This reflects a maturing dialogue about the technical aspects of gravitational wave observatories in the citizen scientist community.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1725576895, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_6f7679d977', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=488, prompt_tokens=23569, total_tokens=24057))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk Dataset 1:

It definitely endorses me to dive into gravity spy data again and again knowing my questions are going to be addressed in a very comprehensive and friendly manner I will definitely try to get familiar with similarity search tool so far I am trying to establish some kind of a pipeline of subsequent actions which one should do in general to investigate different glitches I've just started to understand time frequency resolution tradeoffs which on its own is kind of hard to wrap one's head around now there are additional tools At least it seems to me there are so many different sources to consider but I've got a feeling something settles in my head at last https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3416650/ sounds like a plan! Do take it easy though Rome LIGO wasn't built in a day and there's no substitute for experience acquired over many weeks months and years Keep going and experience will settle on your shoulders like snow on a tree My personal subject studying routine is somewhat complicated but it has evolved over more then five years and is underpinned by having looked at more than a hundred thousand glitches and by keeping long lists of subject numbers and annotations in offline files Let me recommend one additional source of information It's worth keeping a corner of an eye on what other people both veterans and new volunteers are posting in our Talk boards tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk There are some gems to be found also among comments from past years so when you're just finishing classifying something interesting looking you can click Done Talk instead of Done to see the subject's Talk page and any prior discussions linked from it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3416650/ Since at least July to date there are several mentions in Talk of a pending DYCWMI tool bugfix to have it work with ER and O subjects I tried the tool today and it still returns a No data available in table Being already through O4b the tool is much needed for volunteer glitch investigations by offering collection metadata at a glance to observe ranges group characteristics and more As external text editing files are to be used to investigate glitches in the absence of the DYCWMI tool a manual copy paste is required for collections in painstaking manual work subject by subject for what the tool would automatically provide Even further histograms are important visualization tools to determine how the population distribution of collections behaves In the absence of an automated collection histogram it is very challenging to try to create an external distribution chart because with event time metadata null in sim search until O data is publicly released the event date needs to be manually extracted from each spectrogram through the Info button be manually added to each subject metadata row in that external file then processed and finetuned Repeat this many times till an investigation turns satisfactory enough The DYCWMI tool is very useful to the community at large and is vital to round up information and decisions as investigative collections evolve into final curated sets with all information ready for the to consider I would like to hear about the status of the tool bugfix and when it would be expected to be operational with ER and O collections for your attention and all efforts done by the teams to fix bugs all along Sincerely Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3421335/ Wheatgrass or LF blip? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421450/ Tomte koi https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421452/ Scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421454/ Is this vaguely cairn ish? 71Hz Q NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421457/ Ripple comb? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421458/ Extremely loud is there an anglerfish in there? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421460/ Anglerfish flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421462/ 12Hz 11 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421464/ Melted blip 26Hz but I went for NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421470/ Slightly fuzzy? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421472/ Fuzzy range 78Hz 22 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421474/ Anglerfish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421477/ Fuzzy range 22 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421480/ line 52Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421484/ Baby koi flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421485/ Lighthouse koi https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421486/ Off centre Marie Celeste NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ Repeating blips https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421487/ Flock of ?

This would be visible or absent when you click on Done Talk and scroll down a bit The ratio would allow an estimate how many such subjects there exist in total E if roughly every fifth is currently already in the collection then the total number should be around a thousand since I currently have circa and counting collected https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421500/ Sixty seven Nessie coil subjects as far as I've seen so far at most a few very faint ones might still be missing plus the onset tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421501/ I had assumed you needed more of them to be a flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421487/ I can try but have my family coming to stay this weekend https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421500/ Yes queried that a while ago I had thought flock was wrong for a fish School as opposed to shoal then Nothing wrong with being the Daily Pedant https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421485/ Yes can do now I have re read your post after the weekend https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421500/ Doesn't quite look like koi fish more like a very messy road type glitch coming off what might be a very loud or a forest https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422187/ In fact I only learned about the subtle shoal school of fish difference from the linked Wikipedia page after I had looked it up the first time in order to cite it in a Talk comment So it's a school when they're neatly "swimming in the same direction in a coordinated manner" As our Koi babies do in the present subject https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421485/ Yes there's something Extremely Loud centered near the left edge of frame This event probably triggered a properly centered subject as well some seconds earlier than the present subject but I haven't seen it yet https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422187/ Similar to violin mode harmonic but not exactly it? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3121188/ Small sinusoidal wave cool! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Yes violin mode harmonics were one part of the story but there was much else going on during those minutes and the trigger for the present subject happened to be the fainter looking noise around Hz at time seconds So technically this would be more of a case of Repeating Blips but the whole combination is unsual enough that None Of The Above is perhaps the best choice If you're curious here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk is a longer illustrated explanation https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3121188/ this was unique event see A tale of two locklosses and other lists Subject sorry I posted this as duplicate https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3121188/ Pretty catch yes! What's less cool from a LIGO engineer's point of view is that this has been the most common type of glitch at Livingston since the beginning of the fourth observing run in May and it is still not clear how exactly these glitches arise We no longer get the sort of multi arch Scattered Light that was common in past years and that's illustrated in the Field Guide that sort was root caused in late tab The two arches are separated by a darker band covering Hz punctuated by three evenly spaced streaks tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk that's a region where there's a lot of always present stationary background noise which gets suppressed before our images are created So it's a new variant of lower frequency Scattered Light but it's unclear where the scattering happens at the corner station or near one of the two test masses at the ends of the arms and it's unclear what the reflecting item is that's moving relative to the test masses https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Huh so if I understand it correctly something is moving which causes the laser to move slightly thus registering as a "quake" I don't know the appropiate terminolgy sorry and you don't yet know what exactly is moving? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Rapid cycling glitches with the tips being the loudest almost flame like with a very quiet baseline maybe suppressed in this resolution? between about and 72Hz and the tips between about and 400Hz with a frequency of about 125s between peaks https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422780/ A pair of koi fish with the heads centered at about and 0s and a blip centered at about 8s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422784/ Whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/157809/ Lfb https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423032/ Background noise much more vibrant in this one! Something weird happened here https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Yes! We're living on a restless planet Even aside from earthquakes strong enough to be felt the ground beneath our feet is always in motion at speeds of up to about a micrometer per second caused by a mix of weak distant earthquakes wind driven ocean wave activity human activity plus gusts of wind leaning on building walls which then lean on the pillars which support them which then causes the floor under the pillars to tilt a little LIGO's vacuum chambers and the beam tubes connecting them along with anything attached to the walls of the vacuum vessels follow these ground motions Inside four of the large vacuum chambers at each site there are the test masses in their four stage "quad" pendulum suspensions mounted on a three stage internal seismic isolation structure mounted in turn on a hydraulic external pre isolation For some pictures of the hardware see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk So the test masses move a whole lot less than everything around them Between the polished mirror coated front surfaces of the test masses in each arm the main laser beams are circulating Tiny imperfections of the coatings cause a tiny fraction of the laser light to be scattered out of the beams in arbitrary directions Most of the stray light hits one of many baffles and is absorbed A tiny fraction of the stray light however may hit something reflective attached to the walls which are moving relative to the test masses A tiny fraction of the reflected light may hit the nearest test mass again and get scattered back to interfere with the main beam This fraction is what ultimately shows up as glitches If the stray light path length was constant it wouldn't be a problem the backscattered light may be out of phase with the main beam but that's no different from one test mass being a tiny wee little bit in the wrong place which would be automatically corrected But since the reflecting item would be moving relative to the test mass the stray light path length will also change and the phase relationship between the backscattered light and the main beam will change If the stray light path length changes by say s which is approximately laser wavelengths per second we'll get visible noise at about Hz Moreover multiple reflections can cause the stray light path to be traversed multiple times and then we'll also get visible noise at higher frequencies stacks of parallel arches The top of an arch always corresponds to the moment when the reflecting item was moving fastest in one direction or the other relative to the test mass At moments when the motion stops and turns around the arches descend off the bottom of our images The hunt for the causes involves careful analysis of videos of the near infrared light and actively shaking the beam tubes and measuring the effects both with accelerometers mounted on the beam tubes and chambers and in the light that ultimately reaches the detection photodiodes One recent logbook entry among many is LLO tab LIGO Livingston's X end test mass in its suspension center seen from rear left to its right is the suspended reaction mass with circular electrostatic actuator traces plated on it the angular structure on the left is the Arm Cavity Baffle All of the illumination captured here by the camera comes from stray laser light ! LLO ETMX quad Those gold plated electrostatic traces used to be the reflecting item responsible for the classic multi arch Scattered Light glitches during past observing runs This has been addressed since January by more carefully steering the suspensions to keep the distance between each test mass and the reaction mass behind it very nearly constant Any remaining glitches from this path would now occur below Hz where we won't see them in our subject images Looking a little further to the left with the test mass out of view beyond the right edge we now have the Arm Cavity Baffle on the right the cryopump baffle with two glints on its right edge left of center and a on the left a rather bright double glint off a spool piece where there's a large gate valve in the X arm beam tube The corner station would be km further away at rear left ! LLO glints near the end of the X arm Images from the LIGO logbooks courtesy Caltech MIT LIGO Laboratory tab The cryopump baffle is unlikely to be "it" they used to vibrate quite a lot in the presence of elevated ground motion levels and they were responsible for a lot of glitches during O but steps have since been taken to prevent them from vibrating The spool piece might be "it" but this has neither been proven nor ruled out yet The changes in the light path length implied by the frequencies of our arches seem a bit too large for it the spool piece shouldn't be able to move that much Hope this helps a little! By the way note that we don't see the main beam in these images There are more than kW of laser light circulating along earch arm between the reflecting surfaces of the input and end test masses but everything is happening inside a hard vacuum Thus there are next to no air molecules anywhere between the test masses that would scatter some light out of the beam towards the camera as they would if the beam was travelling in air https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ This is a rather common form that Scattered Light glitches from Hanford have been taking during the ongoing fourth observing run No well formed arches just wavy more or less parallel bits and fragments at frequencies mostly between and Hz sometimes with additional pieces between and Hz The band between and Hz tends to appear dark in most of our images It is blanketed by loud stationary noise which gets suppressed before our spectrogram images are created Only the loudest glitches manage to exceed the background noise in this band and show up there as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Very cool! So a lot of parts reflect just not into the recieving sensor? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Yes a lot of things inside the vacuum vessels are shiny and reflective One can't simply paint everything flat black paints don't go well with vacuum Paint molecules would evaporate drift around and settle somewhere else even on the test masses where we absolutely don't want them The baffles get special coatings of non smooth light absorbing materials and even then their edges can still reflect some light But the total area of the large vacuum chambers and long beam tubes is just too much to treat it all in this way That said the mirrors which are meant to reflect light in the intended directions are of exceedingly high quality and almost all of the light does go where it is meant to go The coatings on the end test masses reflect more than of the laser light! And the few parts per million that get through these coatings aren't wasted They are captured by additional optics behind the test masses and are used to measure the circulating light power and the beam position and angle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Very cool! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Baby koi school https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423913/ School of melted blips https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423915/ Scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423919/ School koi plus ?

One possibility I've been mulling over and which may turn out to be wrong is that Cairns might be another part of the same population as Vibration Eruptions tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 1009409?comment where in the latter case the reflecting item the cryopump baffles used to be the prime suspect would be vibrating with larger amplitude thus upconverting the noise to higher frequencies at the culmination and as a byproduct also raising the decay phase which lasts a few seconds to frequencies above Hz where it doesn't get completely drowned out by the stationary background noise Like Cairns Vibration Eruptions attract renderings at a variety of Q values and they are roughly equally rare In this light it is interesting that you've picked up three in between subjects that I would be inclined to file under Vibration Eruption ! frame and tab which has just brought up in Talk may be yet another in between case It would be interesting to learn what the PEM beamtube accelerometer aux channels have to say about all these glitches especially those near the four cryopumps at each site By the way last week I had added another O3b example with renderings at all four Q values of a plausible Cairn to an earlier entry on the first page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3399349?comment of this present thread https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Noting in passing that there are other ongoing mislabeling issues on an even larger scale Hundreds of O4b glitches caused by rung up Violin Mode Harmonics have been getting mis labeled as No Glitch by the ML and have been placed into entry level workflows where they'll get mis classified as such by new volunteers too And lots of higher Q renderings of glitches peaking near Hz from Livingston " Hz monster" fuzzy range week tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3314162?comment to have been mis labeled as Power Line and have likewise wound up in the entry level workflows https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ for the feedback and explanations Interesting to see for how many years Vibration Eruptions have lived through If I picked three subjects that may fit this other class there is always a possibility that one belongs to the other Regarding the Vibration proposal > Shorter duration version lasts almost sec but it is usually longer sec long vibration glitch is not unusual Duration above would not fit Cairn O preliminary characteristics Subspecies perhaps?

There's this thing about looking at the strain channel and an auxiliary channel side by side known as "Gravity Spy 0" > All those mis labelling at a larger scale Well I can't blame the old ML for not knowing what to do with a genuinely new kind of glitch but it needs to be watched by human eyes and should not be blindly trusted to feed Gravity Spy on Zooniverse with a decent distribution of easy and less easy subjects For that matter I myself shouldn't be blindly trusted by anyone either!

If so would it be possible to view an image of the entire whistle? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Is this no glitch ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ there is something ? here very faint though https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424994/ I've seen a few of these "christmas trees" what causes them? also do these sometimes cause lock loss because of how loud they are? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ multiple short sinusoidal waves in the 512HZ range most noticably between 5s and 2s Are these waves caused by the automated control loops? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3064584/ Well observed! This is a good question and I don't know the answer After one of the hundreds of feedback control loops that normally cooperate to maintain a good lock had failed outright when one camera monitoring the beam alignment had stopped working there were multiple unusual things going on at once By the time the present subject was recorded a couple minutes later the Livingston interferometer had already drifted so far from its intended working point that a lockloss was less than seconds away Bits and pieces of this wandering line are visible in a number of subjects from the surrounding minutes tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk I haven't seen anything similar to it in any Livingston O subjects recorded in more normal conditions Do watch out though for a Wandering Line undulating more slowly in a few dozen Hanford O subjects from last January https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3064584/ Yes to fixes applied a few years ago most of it nowadays happens below the Hz bottom edge of our spectrograms we only get to see the topmost parts of the action https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ NOTA is fine when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes This subject shows a coincidental mix of two different independent glitches The tall central feature with hints of "lighthouse" decorations could be called a Blip although it's a bit of a stretch if it had been louder it would turn into a kind of Extremely Loud The "wheatgrass" surrounding it below Hz is a form of Scattered Light rendered as rows of beatnote pulses here because this subject was processed with very fine time resolution at the expense of very coarse frequency resolution The "fins" of a Koi Fish would look somewhat similar but more symmetric and at slightly higher frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ The raw data are recorded at a rate of samples per second so frequencies up to Hz could be extracted with some distortion and up to a little beyond Hz in sufficient quality to create images like ours this isn't normally done here since it costs extra memory and processing time and most glitches don't need it I don't have a timestamp for the present subject so I can't produce another image of this particular Whistle even though the raw data from the first three observing runs are public by now but see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2079928?comment page for some other examples and illustrations! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Another great question! Some old examples aside it is safe to assume that every Gravity Spy subject from recent and ongoing observing runs contains a glitch or rarely a real gravitational wave chirp something that exceeded the ever present background noise levels by at least a factor of But that Something isn't always visible in the resulting image The Gravity Spy tools tab Watch out for other NotNoGlitch subjects There are many with reported peak frequencies around or around Hz betraying a violin mode origin quite a few from Hanford at or Hz which tend to belong into a proposed new class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk some from Hanford at or Hz and more from Livingston at Hz which belong into another propopsed class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and some others https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ What happens when a participant chooses NOTA? Does it get sent to a higher level for further inspection? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ I just checked the datasets at gwosc to see if I could get the data from there but it looks like data from January to November is missing entirely? Why is this? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ First of all This is an extraneous subject there must exist another where the obvious extremely loud glitch appears properly centered I haven't seen it yet but it would probably look somewhat like tab recorded a day and a half earlier The difference in appearance is due to rendering choices coarse vs fine time resolution combined with fine vs coarse frequency resolution Why do we get such extraneous off center subjects? Mostly because the glitch detection software inspects minute long chunks of data at a time setting to work in near real time whenever another minute's worth of data has become available The "outskirts" of a loud glitch near the end of one chunk can then cause another spurious detection at the beginning of the next chunk as in this case or the onset of a loud glitch near the beginning of a fresh chunk can already have caused a spurious detection at the end of the preceding chunk Next This one did not cause a lockloss we see clean data with just the usual amount of faint random background noise everywhere in the right half of the fourth frame But similar glitches are among the loudest that a LIGO interferometer can with luck survive without losing its lock tab is one of the loudest such I've seen at an SNR above And even louder ones can cause a lockloss E this one did some seconds beyond the " s" right edge of the fourth frame ! frame What causes this kind of extremely loud glitches? Ultimately earthquakes or thunderclaps or very strong gusts of wind which despite the multi stage seismic isolation manage to cause one or more of the mirror suspensions to shake The feedback control loops which keep the arm length difference "DARM" constant to within a picometer a millionth of a micrometer and those which keep the test masses mirrors at their proper angles to allow the laser light to bounce back and forth between them more than a hundred times operate in a mode with limited actuation strength and low noise once the lock has been acquired They can compensate and damp some amount of unwanted motion but not a lot When more force would be needed than is available things will momentarily depart from the proper working point resulting in a sudden LOT of noise in the data and a loudspeaker in the control room will automatically issue a verbal alert like "EX saturation!" to the operator With luck acting a little longer with the limited force available may still suffice to recover from the disturbance or it may not the lock may be lost a fast shutter closes within milliseconds to protect the detection photodiodes the input laser power is ramped down the remaining circulating laser light ends up in beam dumps and the lock would need to be reacquired slowly The saturation and lockloss illustrated above at 19T was caused by an earthquake and goes with LLO tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ In case of a no glitch should I use the tools to see if this is really the case and then report as NOTA if there is something? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ I'll have a look at the tools I assume these should only be used when the glitch class isn't clear? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ In the long run yes or it may just be kept around until all the newly discovered glitch classes have been studied sufficiently to re train the Machine Learning and to make some of them official so that further submissions can then mark them as "one of the above" And in any case NOTA ensures that more people are going to get a look! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Because the first Observing Run of Advanced LIGO ended on and the second started on GWOSC only holds published data tab Engineering Runs are thus excluded weekly maintenance periods are excluded routine half hour calibration measurement periods are excluded and of course there are no data from times when the observatories weren't observing g recovering from a lockloss or weren't even running because of lengthy upgrades tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2800503?comment between observing runs https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ You mention SNR what is this a measurement of? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Ah ok so gravity spy uses all data? this subject is from https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Ah ok how accurate has the algorithm gotten so far? Anywhere I can read up on this? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ It's up to you how deeply you want to delve into each subject! Sometimes Similarity Search provides insights that aren't easy to come by in other ways Personally I am going to some extremes but I certainly don't expect everybody else to do so I will run a "NotNoGlitch" subject through a similarity search for result immediately based on the character identifier which I can already access while classifying just to see whether it belongs under Violin Modes or Low Frequency Lines or somewhere else Otherwise I'll just make a note of the subject number to return to it later I would usually add a subject to an appropriate collection only after it has been returned as a result from a small similarity search starting from another subject by which time I would also have written down the peak frequency and other metadata and eyeballed an approximate timestamp to within minutes or so and then I feed the collected subject's number back into another sim search to keep my to do queues populated I also keep track of how often each subject has appeared as a sim search result In this way I can gradually build collections of the most representative subjects of each kind Cascades of many small searches asking for rather fewer than results each time tend to work much better for exploring an underlying populations than doing only a few searches asking for many results Of course the tool being image based mixes up all the NotNoGlitch subjects https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ Signal to background Noise Ratio or in this case glitch noise level divided by background noise level https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ The "date" stamps of old subjects are dummy values reflecting the date on which the upload script was last modified Only since the fourth observing run do we have the real event date available through the nfo button Admittedly this is a little confusing but then almost all old subjects have been deactivated from the workflows in order to focus on the new material except for the gold standard subjects and for a selection of Whistles from O to make up for a total lack of Whistles from O so far The present subject dates from the first observing run and was uploaded to Zooniverse in October after results from a pilot phase of the budding project had been evaluated Subjects from later runs have the run number embedded in their titles after the observatory name https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ To be frank at the moment the Machine Learning is all over the place The glitch mix coming from the LIGO observatories during the ongoing fourth observing run differs very much from anything we've seen before and from everything the ML had previously been trained for We still have recognizable Blips and Koi Fish but Scattered Light looks very different now and there are many completely new things tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and some new things that look deceptively similar to old glitch classes that haven't reoccurred in years or whose causes have been completely eliminated in the course of observatory upgrades And changing anything in the ML takes time tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3369772?comment One fairly recent paper is Y Wu al Advancing Glitch Classification in Gravity Spy Multi view Fusion with Attention based Machine Learning for Advanced LIGO's Fourth Observing Run tab You'll find this along with a selection of older material linked from Talk > Help > Resources tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk very much for your sustained interest! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ for the comprehensive answer! The tool seems complex but I'm sure I'll get used to it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ I've opened a PR to fix this by tracking your current workflow in a session cookie It might be a few months before it gets reviewed by Zooniverse though https github com zooniverse front end monorepo pull 6216 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ Jim! Just a question for my own understanding I'm aware that a fair amount of browser side Zooniverse state both PFE and FEM is cached in session storage Are cookies currently also being used for anything aside from authentication and statistics gathering? Or would this be the first use of cookies for maintaining functional state? Why I am asking is When a volunteer switches among several devices or among several different browsers browser profiles on one device session state for which the single source of truth is on the server side will be fetched and cached and the new session will be in sync with where the previous session had left off But cookies won't carry over This might cause surprises If there's already other functional state that's kept in cookies then I'd expect fewer surprises But if not then a solution based on the existing per user per project project preferences stored server side and cached browser side might be preferable in the long term so as to have all such features work in similar ways The server side project preferences already remember in which workflow of the project I've been active most recently and if I'm not mistaken they are already being fetched by both frontends when a classifier is launched so the information would be available to the frontends it's just not being used at the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ I'll have a look at the paper you sent very much for the quick and helpful answers! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Fair enough https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ So 95440075's glitch is times louder ? clearer? brighter? than the background? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Yes that's it "Louder" is probably the best word Astronomers speak of a binary neutron star merger as a " standard siren tab The SNR is computed in relation to the small random background fluctuations not in relation to the DC light level Also ever present stationary noise a lot of it esp at low frequencies but also at a number of fixed higher frequencies is removed before considering the random background and computing SNRs Here's a plot of yesterday's stationary background noise levels from the detector status summary page for the day tab !

Is it possible this subject may be a weird blip chirp shape due to a coarse time resolution?

Indeed this was a completely new kind of glitch tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk first noted from LIGO Hanford on The cause remains unkown In late April another series of similar looking glitches happened again at Hanford during a couple of days And then from until we got a few hundred somewhat similar glitches from Livingston two of which are among your similarity search results In that case the cause is known it turned out tab Glitches from all three of these episodes have attracted a mix of low Q and high Q renderings so they differ widely in appearance If you want to see for yourself how a Blip changes in appearance under different rendering choices let's take one from O where the precise event timestamps and raw data have been published by now Head to the glitch plotter tab The same can be done with a published Binary Black Hole BBH chirp from O say GW tab Per the current version of the LIGO Data Management Plan tab way https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426474/ Yes the top of one arch just barely peeping over the bottom edge and then the top of a lesser parallel arch just above the dark Hz stationary noise band https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426516/ Because each of these baby Koi glitches is a very close overlapping double two humps at the top end and often a few dark holes down the middle where the two short duration things partially cancel https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426519/ Not too fuzzy just Scattered Light rendered at Q in between wheatgrass and scattering comb shapes https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ It hard working out which is which! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ I find it very difficult to make out Easily missed! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426516/ Be assured that you're miles ahead of the ML in this regard https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ ! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ I ve updated the GitHub PR to explain how a SameSite cookie protects against accidentally loading the wrong workflow when following a link from an email or external site https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ As a matter of interest maybe to others like myself what on earth is ConvNN?

Or is it promotion to level that's not working? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Promotion to level is not working https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ A Convolutional Neural Network tab The simulated cells are arranged in layers The given image is divided into arrays of overlapping little squares The image data in each square are fed into one of the cells in the first layer Each of these input cells reacts to left right or up down or diagonal gradients brightness variations in its input square this is the "convolutional" part The outputs of the first layer cells in all sorts of combinations are processed further by the next layers Each successive layer is able to detect more complicated combinations of image traits straight or curved edges small or large uniform regions arches parallel streaks fuzziness Nessie coils After some four or five or six intermediate layers the final output layer consists of one cell for each glitch class or whatever one is trying to classify The one that "shouts most loudly" determines the label that will be attached to the image and how loudly it "shouts" compared to the others provides a confidence estimate During training the connections among the layers are strengthened or weakened at random until the outputs delivered on the training images agree reasonably well with the intended classifications This too aims to imitate how we understand learning to happen in real brains Hope this is suitably basic!

We are having a talk about AI in our village hall next month so I thought I would try and get my head around it Sorry I should have started a new chat conversation https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ Among the various O "NotNoGlitch" subjects a few hundred mostly from Hanford O4b stand out They have peak frequencies near or near Hz and are readily tied to logbook entries about rung up violin modes The Machine Learning has been calling them No Glitch and indeed there's nothing much to see yet Omicron had triggered on them as excess noise with SNRs above or else they wouldn't exist as Gravity Spy subjects But it turns out that they don't actually represent glitches in the strain channel They represent elevated stationary noise levels in DARM and strain varying only gradually on time scales of minutes to hours They really originate as glitches in the glitch detection itself Thus I'm documenting them here as a distinct subclass of Violin Mode Harmonics Proposed Name LIGO O Invisible Violins ID of proposer Date of proposal Reference subjects for Classifier and Field Guide S holotype linked above S S S ! frame showing the second frames Short description Nothing at all stands out visually Minor unrelated noise may be present The peak frequencies accessible through Similarity Search tab Characteristics As above SNRs rarely exceed All Q value choices can occur Overlapping pairs of subjects are unusually common see below Hash tags a Collections NB the metadata links do not work at present pending a DYCWMI tool bugfix but will work once the tool has been fixed no training set at this time since the current Machine Learning doesn't take Omicron metadata into account Bulk collections growing H ER O4a Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h er a invisible violins link to its metadata tab L ER O4a Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant l er a invisible violins link to its metadata tab H ER O4b Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h er b invisible violins link to its metadata tab L ER O4b Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant l er b invisible violins link to its metadata tab Collaborators Remarks In fact not only is there an unusual excess of overlapping pairs of subjects these pairs also straddle full second boundaries at one minute intervals The examples from all come just before or just after a GPS second that fell seconds after a multiple of Those from all happened seconds after a multiple of On the other hand the seconds periodicity tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk of the Pizzicato glitches from O has disappeared completely Example pairs more will keep turning up from between and UTC tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab and from between and UTC tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab What must have been happening here is that Omicron in the presence of a rung up violin mode or other loud stationary narrowband noise tends to trigger near the end of its current seconds chunk of data and then again near the beginning of the next seconds chunk Sometimes only one member of such a pair of triggers will exceed the SNR > threshold for creating a Gravity Spy subject Sometimes both would remain too faint to show up here https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ So what to do about these triggers? Are they useful? Are they necessary? Could we do without them? The observatory operators and the data quality team on their weekly shifts don't need them rung up violin modes are reported in other more direct ways They do add some spice to the Gravity Spy volunteer experience One more sort of thing that requires taking a closer look and extracting the peak frequency using the Similarity Search tool tab It is likely that they could be avoided by padding the minute long data chunks on which Omicron operates with shoulders of at least seconds on both sides my experience whilst working with the glitch plotter tab So it may be better to keep things as they are and live with these "glitches" It's worth noting that the Virgo team had encountered a very similar issue at the beginning of O tab O https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ For the record below I am listing documented episodes of rung up violin modes from which we've seen visible or invisible fallout as Gravity Spy subjects ER LHO LHO tab O4a LHO 04ff LHO tab LLO briefly very visible just before a lockloss see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk LHO and following ITMY mode and later Hz with a series of logbook entries including LHO tab LHO LHO tab LHO 28ff LHO tab LLO 28f LLO tab LHO LHO tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ ER none O4b LLO 15f LLO tab LHO LHO tab LHO LHO tab I have not yet seen any subjects from subequent episodes LHO LHO tab LLO LLO tab LLO 16ff LLO tab LLO 31ff LLO tab LLO LLO tab modes https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ The images fed to the GravitySpy ML ConvNN day in day out while the observatories are Observing are the same that then get uploaded to Zooniverse as subjects for us to inspect except that the ML gets to "view" all four frames at once side by side and without the title texts colourmap axis tick marks and labels only the four spectrogram images themselves For re training purposes it would be fed a set of around a hundred such images carefully selected and believed to be representative of a single new glitch class In reality it's somewhat more complicated The set is split up randomly into a larger part used for the training phase and a smaller part for testing validation Then the current training subset is run through the neural network adjusting the cell connections in the process and the outcome is evaluated on the current test subset while keeping the connections fixed And then this is repeated with a new random splitting of the given subject set many times until the results no longer improve in further iterations The sort of language oriented AI that has been getting headlines in the last year and a half ChatGPT and friends works completely differently though The only commonalities are that they also run on computers and also need to be trained But they require vastly larger amounts of training data and existing Large Language Models have been trained on data of sometimes extremely dubious quality not to mention copyright infringements on a global scale https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ No doubt people will want to know about ChatGPT I have never used it but have actually heard about it for your explanations https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ Lockloss https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428724/ School of koi https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428725/ Fuzzy range?

The title subject is a rare Q rendering of a flock as is The remainder of the sim search results is something of a mixed bunch Since the choice of Q value has such a large effect on the general texture of the resulting subject images the Similarity Search tool tends to be more sensitive to the Q value than to the glitch class And since flocks at Q are rare it returns an eclectic mix of other things instead Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Whether you're browsing recent pages or viewing the results of a logbook search is specific to your current browser session and can't be exported through a URL The link you see in the URL field of your browser when you're looking at the search results ends up pointing at the logbook start page for everyone else No loss in the present case since flocks aren't momentous enough as glitches go to earn specific logbook mentions Only individual logbook entries and comments on them can be linked to directly Their URLs can be captured for pasting by using the browser's "Copy link" function on the "Link" button in the entry heading https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ for the feedback and information An eclectic mix indeed as sim search sees it I took a look at the array of subjects tagged with "flock" there is a wide variety of glitches making up a flock seems pretty special > Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Yes I recalled something about this from previous logbook searches seeing that my draft post returned the Home page after having pasted the URL on top of the search results even though that search URL contained the corresponding "page 1" and "page 2" appended yet switched to the Home page when pasted into the address bar Many thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ ! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ The center object looks a bit odd https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ What is the top glitch? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ I just got promoted from gravity spy level to gravity spy level So manually promoting may have fixed it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I would be very grateful if I could be manually promoted to Level Four as I have been on Level Three for sometime and yet Level Four is still locked Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi Brian While this is a very old glitch from I'd say that it looks like Blip ssp trumpetfish proposed This dated glitch brings back the sim search problem of duplicates where after a recent fix in this regard it no longer runs on older subjects having multiple identical copies returning the message " Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site " Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Is this scattered light ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Ah so the same glitch is still out there just with a different ID? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Tiny dot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ Hi for your interest If I understood correctly your question each subject has a unique subject id and then a random subject number assigned across all Zooniverse subjects As of this seeming Trumpetfish there are many subjects that fit the subclass definition each having a different subject id Yes Trumpetfish seems to be still around to date as is the case with many other classes and subclasses Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ The glitches visible in the strain channel are classic multi arch Scattered Light the kind that was still common during most of the third observing run before it got fixed in January The auxiliary channel which monitors the light circulating in the X arm represented by the few parts per million of it which make it through the mirror coatings on the end test mass and then get captured by the optics of the transmission monitoring system didn't witness it on this occasion The present S is a counterpart to S https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ Nice catch! This and similar subjects mostly from Hanford with brief sometimes repeating noise near and or around Hz are None Of The Above Sometimes we call them "Pirate Ships" by a superficial analogy with the old Virgo O glitch class of that name At Hanford they are caused by beam jitter they show up when the laser beam already wobbles sideways a little at the point where it enters the first vacuum chamber The subset near Hz got almost completely fixed in October the others still occur occasionally They are relatively rare They may yet earn a formal glitch class proposal once we've collected enough examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Another kind of None Of The Above These require a glance at the Similarity Search tool tab ended https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ To clarify this is primarily a gold standard example of Repeating Blips intended to familiarize volunteers in the level workflow with cases where groups of individual glitchlets need to be treated as a whole and where it is essential to look at the fourth frame and take in the whole picture And I agree on the central constituent blip being slightly mis shapen because it is coincidentally blended with a bit of unrelated lower frequency noise In some cases ancient subjects that had already been uploaded once before the Gravity Spy tools existed to serve as gold standard examples were uploaded a second time later as ordinary subjects with new subject numbers and were then also added to the Similarity Search tool's database Thus Sim Search won't find the present subject under its original number but a search for the character subject id uniqueid IdrpGAG37s will succeed and will find the copy with subject number Note that the image was reprocessed for this purpose In the newer copy the image title mentions the first observing run O explicitly https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ for the clarification Indeed it is important to look at the four frames and I had done so as usual just overlooked mentioning it I had seen the repeating glitches found them to be too unclear to determine which type of Blip they are and then focused around https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ GS promotion uses a different system You need to classify in level of GS to get to level of GS so let me know if that happens or not https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I promoted you as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ for the promotion to Level I did classify on that level which did then allowed me to be promoted to do Level classifications again for all your help with this issue I really enjoy classifying the many new glitches! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Almost no background noise! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Got this error message while searching for glitches similar to the subject Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site I guess it may be related to several lockloss events happened during that day but the shape is quite weird and I cannot obtain any rather fine timestamp for this subject for further correlation to be honest I am not even sure with what can I correlate besides logbook and detector status page Anyway would be happy to know if it is normal to have some subject present on zooniverse website and missing somewhere else as well as get some tips on how to treat such examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Apologies for the invoncenience! Last year there were occasional hiccups with the subject upload process which resulted in repeated upload attempts and thus in accidental duplications and it has not been feasible to clean up completely afterwards The present glitch is one of that happened between and at Hanford cause unknown and not related to locklosses but nearly each of them was uploaded to Zooniverse five times under five different subject numbers without making it into the Gravity Spy tools before finally being successfully uploaded a sixth time The good and usable subjects from those days have numbers 9636xxxx the earlier 9287xxxx through 9343xxxx should be considered as extraneous duplicates If we were to remove them from Zooniverse now we would also orphan the associated Talk threads and produce inconsistencies in any collections containing them The usable version of the present subject is tab As to how to deal with the duplicates I would frown at them flag them as such by adding them to suitable marker collections and move on to the next subject There's also a small handful of subjects showing other kinds of glitches of which two or more copies exist in the Similarity Seach database and these can produce a different nondescript error when one asks for fewer results than the number of copies There used to be many more during O many subjects had been ingested four or five times and there was one that had got uploaded more than a thousand times those had been cleared out at one point leaving only one representative subject of each glitch Clearing out the few that exist at the present time would require a disproportionate amount of manual effort so we've left them alone https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ oki thanks for clarification! Recently I started getting glitches from this sequence one after another but was unable to find any info in Talk Btw how did you manage to find usable version of the subject in question? Definitely not by brute forcing subject IDs matching right? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Yes well observed you'll see this in a number of ancient subjects If I am not mistaken the reason is that back then well before my time the normalized noise energy was fed into the colormap as is whereas more recent subjects use the logarithm of the normalized energy which will show some finer glitch details as well as the random background more clearly Noise levels within a single subject image can vary by five orders of magnitude even after the removal of stationary noise "whitening" during preprocessing https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ One of our veteran volunteers who is currently taking a break from Zooniverse had collected almost all of these two hundred something Hz glitch subjects as they come up whilst classifying Once our systematic similarity searches across the good ones found no further examples it was a matter of looking at each of the good ones in turn find its exact copies in the twenty odd collection pages where twelve subject per page are displayed write down the relationships in an offline file and remove the copies from the bulk collection so this eyeball search became easier with each glitch that we had dealt with A few duplicates had been missed and only showed up later and these could be tied in by eyeballing the collection of good representatives which fits on pages https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Can someone shed some light on what to classify this one please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ I have seen quite a few of these "512" short lines How to classify please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ I see a few of these strong solid line at Classification same as ripple? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ I have not seen this type before Any thoughts? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/ So some of the fainter glitches g scratchy were just not visible back then? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Scattered light with somerhing faint above very faint blip maybe? I put this as NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430538/ Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and thank you for contributing! None Of The Above is always an option whenever something doesn't want to fit easily into the available classes And this is often the case at present During the fourth observing run that's now in progress after three years of upgrades tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2800503?comment the LIGO interferometers have been producing a glitch mix that's very different from anything we had seen before Some old glitch classes still occur in recognizable forms some still occur but look different some no longer occur and quite a few completely new things tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk have been coming up The present subject comes from a brief episode on tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk when one of Livingston's feedback control loops had failed and over the course of a mere three minutes the interferometer drifted so far from its working point that the lock was lost We already see multiple things going on at once here repeating blips violin mode harmonics a wandering line While it's not at all obvious it was one of the repeating blips that triggered this subject But None Of The Above is certainly appropriate too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ None Of The Above They were a completely new and unexpected thing tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk when they suddenly started happening in large numbers during three days in late May and early June https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ Well noted! Again I would recommend None Of The Above These Hz glitches were another new thing when they showed up on at Hanford and then stopped happening again at the end of the month Only such glitches seem to have been recorded too few to justify a formal glitch class proposal the cause remains a mystery Around that time there were hiccups with the uploading of subjects to the Gravity Spy tools tab The Ripples have not reoccurred in the 3rd and 4th observing runs but there are some lookalikes that have been confusing the Gravity Spy Machine Learning too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ Yet another type of None Of The Above! These mini jolts like the Hz glitches come from beam jitter when the laser beam wobbles sideways by a tiny amount already before it enters the first vacuum chamber On this particular occasion on technicians had been pulling fiber cables under the raised floors near the control room to connect a fire alarm panel The connection to these glitches was soon noted tab Why not start a collection of these? It will come in helpful There isn't a formal glitch class proposal for these jitter glitches yet but I guess there have been enough of them to justify one once we can support it with collections of representative subjects https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/ They would have been visible when they occurred on their own thanks to the energy normalization but not when anything louder was also present https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Well observed! Yes that's a blip up there and looking at the reported peak frequency of Hz it was what triggered this subject although the image rendering then paid more attention to the accompanying scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430538/ Not sure if I should post it here but I didn't find any other suitable board to post it in anyway For the past days since I switched to level I constantly get similar subjects Sometimes they go one after another sometimes zooniverse put 'golden' subjects between them but what I mostly get is either H O Hz transient lines which do not have a clickable classification for them but were described in details in this thread Example https imgur com a AGZbIwX https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3430635/ https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3430635/ No problem and glad to hear that it worked and you're enjoying it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ the true chirp !

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.
    
GRAVITYBOT RESPONSE:
ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-A4Grrsh1yQpIZzkdxBMwCaQgpxE3Z', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='1. **New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Invisible Violins:** This proposed new glitch class describes a phenomenon where the glitches represent elevated stationary noise levels in DARM, originating as glitches in the glitch detection itself. These are characterized by high SNRs and are visually undetectable, hence termed "Invisible Violins." This class underscores an advanced understanding of the subtleties involved in interpreting LIGO data. \n     - URL variables: [Invisible Violins](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430821/)\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - Concerns about the effectiveness of existing classifications are highlighted by the confusion around the classification of certain glitches like "512Hz lines" and others that do not fit neatly into predefined categories. Participants express frustration and seek clarification on how to classify these anomalies, indicating gaps or overlaps in current classification schemes.\n     - URL variables: [Concerns about classifications](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/), [Confusion on 512Hz lines](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/)\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - Participants in Talk Dataset 2 demonstrate an increasing curiosity about the technical nuances of glitches and their classifications. For instance, questions arise about the appearance of blips and chirps at high Q values, which reflect a deeper dive into the properties that define different glitches under varying analytical conditions.\n   - The discourse also extends to the practical aspects of machine learning tools used in glitch identification, such as the role and function of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNN), showing a keen interest in the technology behind the classifications.\n     - URL variables: [Technical questions on blips and chirps](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426474/), [Inquiry about ConvNN](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/)\n\n4. **Hypotheses on Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - A hypothesis discussed involves beam jitter caused by technicians pulling fiber cables, which elucidates how human activities near the sensor environment can induce specific types of glitches. This scenario connects physical actions within the observatory to the data anomalies observed, providing a concrete example of environmental impact on sensor readings.\n     - URL variables: [Hypothesis on beam jitter](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/)\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there’s a noticeable query regarding whether certain glitches are related directly to specific sensors or channels used in the LIGO observatories. This includes discussions on whether the origin of some glitches can be pinpointed to particular components or if they manifest universally across different channels. Such discussions indicate a maturing understanding of the complex interplay between hardware components and observed data anomalies.\n   - An example is the detailed analysis of the "Invisible Violins" glitch class, where the discussion revolves around the nuances of specific detection channels and their susceptibility to certain types of noise.\n     - URL variables: [Sensor specific glitches](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430821/)', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1725581515, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_6f7679d977', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=740, prompt_tokens=22985, total_tokens=23725))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk Dataset 1:

It definitely endorses me to dive into gravity spy data again and again knowing my questions are going to be addressed in a very comprehensive and friendly manner I will definitely try to get familiar with similarity search tool so far I am trying to establish some kind of a pipeline of subsequent actions which one should do in general to investigate different glitches I've just started to understand time frequency resolution tradeoffs which on its own is kind of hard to wrap one's head around now there are additional tools At least it seems to me there are so many different sources to consider but I've got a feeling something settles in my head at last https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3416650/ sounds like a plan! Do take it easy though Rome LIGO wasn't built in a day and there's no substitute for experience acquired over many weeks months and years Keep going and experience will settle on your shoulders like snow on a tree My personal subject studying routine is somewhat complicated but it has evolved over more then five years and is underpinned by having looked at more than a hundred thousand glitches and by keeping long lists of subject numbers and annotations in offline files Let me recommend one additional source of information It's worth keeping a corner of an eye on what other people both veterans and new volunteers are posting in our Talk boards tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk There are some gems to be found also among comments from past years so when you're just finishing classifying something interesting looking you can click Done Talk instead of Done to see the subject's Talk page and any prior discussions linked from it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3416650/ Since at least July to date there are several mentions in Talk of a pending DYCWMI tool bugfix to have it work with ER and O subjects I tried the tool today and it still returns a No data available in table Being already through O4b the tool is much needed for volunteer glitch investigations by offering collection metadata at a glance to observe ranges group characteristics and more As external text editing files are to be used to investigate glitches in the absence of the DYCWMI tool a manual copy paste is required for collections in painstaking manual work subject by subject for what the tool would automatically provide Even further histograms are important visualization tools to determine how the population distribution of collections behaves In the absence of an automated collection histogram it is very challenging to try to create an external distribution chart because with event time metadata null in sim search until O data is publicly released the event date needs to be manually extracted from each spectrogram through the Info button be manually added to each subject metadata row in that external file then processed and finetuned Repeat this many times till an investigation turns satisfactory enough The DYCWMI tool is very useful to the community at large and is vital to round up information and decisions as investigative collections evolve into final curated sets with all information ready for the to consider I would like to hear about the status of the tool bugfix and when it would be expected to be operational with ER and O collections for your attention and all efforts done by the teams to fix bugs all along Sincerely Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3421335/ Wheatgrass or LF blip? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421450/ Tomte koi https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421452/ Scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421454/ Is this vaguely cairn ish? 71Hz Q NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421457/ Ripple comb? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421458/ Extremely loud is there an anglerfish in there? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421460/ Anglerfish flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421462/ 12Hz 11 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421464/ Melted blip 26Hz but I went for NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421470/ Slightly fuzzy? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421472/ Fuzzy range 78Hz 22 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421474/ Anglerfish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421477/ Fuzzy range 22 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421480/ line 52Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421484/ Baby koi flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421485/ Lighthouse koi https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421486/ Off centre Marie Celeste NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ Repeating blips https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421487/ Flock of ?

This would be visible or absent when you click on Done Talk and scroll down a bit The ratio would allow an estimate how many such subjects there exist in total E if roughly every fifth is currently already in the collection then the total number should be around a thousand since I currently have circa and counting collected https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421500/ Sixty seven Nessie coil subjects as far as I've seen so far at most a few very faint ones might still be missing plus the onset tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421501/ I had assumed you needed more of them to be a flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421487/ I can try but have my family coming to stay this weekend https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421500/ Yes queried that a while ago I had thought flock was wrong for a fish School as opposed to shoal then Nothing wrong with being the Daily Pedant https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421485/ Yes can do now I have re read your post after the weekend https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421500/ Doesn't quite look like koi fish more like a very messy road type glitch coming off what might be a very loud or a forest https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422187/ In fact I only learned about the subtle shoal school of fish difference from the linked Wikipedia page after I had looked it up the first time in order to cite it in a Talk comment So it's a school when they're neatly "swimming in the same direction in a coordinated manner" As our Koi babies do in the present subject https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421485/ Yes there's something Extremely Loud centered near the left edge of frame This event probably triggered a properly centered subject as well some seconds earlier than the present subject but I haven't seen it yet https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422187/ Similar to violin mode harmonic but not exactly it? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3121188/ Small sinusoidal wave cool! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Yes violin mode harmonics were one part of the story but there was much else going on during those minutes and the trigger for the present subject happened to be the fainter looking noise around Hz at time seconds So technically this would be more of a case of Repeating Blips but the whole combination is unsual enough that None Of The Above is perhaps the best choice If you're curious here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk is a longer illustrated explanation https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3121188/ this was unique event see A tale of two locklosses and other lists Subject sorry I posted this as duplicate https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3121188/ Pretty catch yes! What's less cool from a LIGO engineer's point of view is that this has been the most common type of glitch at Livingston since the beginning of the fourth observing run in May and it is still not clear how exactly these glitches arise We no longer get the sort of multi arch Scattered Light that was common in past years and that's illustrated in the Field Guide that sort was root caused in late tab The two arches are separated by a darker band covering Hz punctuated by three evenly spaced streaks tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk that's a region where there's a lot of always present stationary background noise which gets suppressed before our images are created So it's a new variant of lower frequency Scattered Light but it's unclear where the scattering happens at the corner station or near one of the two test masses at the ends of the arms and it's unclear what the reflecting item is that's moving relative to the test masses https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Huh so if I understand it correctly something is moving which causes the laser to move slightly thus registering as a "quake" I don't know the appropiate terminolgy sorry and you don't yet know what exactly is moving? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Rapid cycling glitches with the tips being the loudest almost flame like with a very quiet baseline maybe suppressed in this resolution? between about and 72Hz and the tips between about and 400Hz with a frequency of about 125s between peaks https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422780/ A pair of koi fish with the heads centered at about and 0s and a blip centered at about 8s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422784/ Whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/157809/ Lfb https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423032/ Background noise much more vibrant in this one! Something weird happened here https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Yes! We're living on a restless planet Even aside from earthquakes strong enough to be felt the ground beneath our feet is always in motion at speeds of up to about a micrometer per second caused by a mix of weak distant earthquakes wind driven ocean wave activity human activity plus gusts of wind leaning on building walls which then lean on the pillars which support them which then causes the floor under the pillars to tilt a little LIGO's vacuum chambers and the beam tubes connecting them along with anything attached to the walls of the vacuum vessels follow these ground motions Inside four of the large vacuum chambers at each site there are the test masses in their four stage "quad" pendulum suspensions mounted on a three stage internal seismic isolation structure mounted in turn on a hydraulic external pre isolation For some pictures of the hardware see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk So the test masses move a whole lot less than everything around them Between the polished mirror coated front surfaces of the test masses in each arm the main laser beams are circulating Tiny imperfections of the coatings cause a tiny fraction of the laser light to be scattered out of the beams in arbitrary directions Most of the stray light hits one of many baffles and is absorbed A tiny fraction of the stray light however may hit something reflective attached to the walls which are moving relative to the test masses A tiny fraction of the reflected light may hit the nearest test mass again and get scattered back to interfere with the main beam This fraction is what ultimately shows up as glitches If the stray light path length was constant it wouldn't be a problem the backscattered light may be out of phase with the main beam but that's no different from one test mass being a tiny wee little bit in the wrong place which would be automatically corrected But since the reflecting item would be moving relative to the test mass the stray light path length will also change and the phase relationship between the backscattered light and the main beam will change If the stray light path length changes by say s which is approximately laser wavelengths per second we'll get visible noise at about Hz Moreover multiple reflections can cause the stray light path to be traversed multiple times and then we'll also get visible noise at higher frequencies stacks of parallel arches The top of an arch always corresponds to the moment when the reflecting item was moving fastest in one direction or the other relative to the test mass At moments when the motion stops and turns around the arches descend off the bottom of our images The hunt for the causes involves careful analysis of videos of the near infrared light and actively shaking the beam tubes and measuring the effects both with accelerometers mounted on the beam tubes and chambers and in the light that ultimately reaches the detection photodiodes One recent logbook entry among many is LLO tab LIGO Livingston's X end test mass in its suspension center seen from rear left to its right is the suspended reaction mass with circular electrostatic actuator traces plated on it the angular structure on the left is the Arm Cavity Baffle All of the illumination captured here by the camera comes from stray laser light ! LLO ETMX quad Those gold plated electrostatic traces used to be the reflecting item responsible for the classic multi arch Scattered Light glitches during past observing runs This has been addressed since January by more carefully steering the suspensions to keep the distance between each test mass and the reaction mass behind it very nearly constant Any remaining glitches from this path would now occur below Hz where we won't see them in our subject images Looking a little further to the left with the test mass out of view beyond the right edge we now have the Arm Cavity Baffle on the right the cryopump baffle with two glints on its right edge left of center and a on the left a rather bright double glint off a spool piece where there's a large gate valve in the X arm beam tube The corner station would be km further away at rear left ! LLO glints near the end of the X arm Images from the LIGO logbooks courtesy Caltech MIT LIGO Laboratory tab The cryopump baffle is unlikely to be "it" they used to vibrate quite a lot in the presence of elevated ground motion levels and they were responsible for a lot of glitches during O but steps have since been taken to prevent them from vibrating The spool piece might be "it" but this has neither been proven nor ruled out yet The changes in the light path length implied by the frequencies of our arches seem a bit too large for it the spool piece shouldn't be able to move that much Hope this helps a little! By the way note that we don't see the main beam in these images There are more than kW of laser light circulating along earch arm between the reflecting surfaces of the input and end test masses but everything is happening inside a hard vacuum Thus there are next to no air molecules anywhere between the test masses that would scatter some light out of the beam towards the camera as they would if the beam was travelling in air https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ This is a rather common form that Scattered Light glitches from Hanford have been taking during the ongoing fourth observing run No well formed arches just wavy more or less parallel bits and fragments at frequencies mostly between and Hz sometimes with additional pieces between and Hz The band between and Hz tends to appear dark in most of our images It is blanketed by loud stationary noise which gets suppressed before our spectrogram images are created Only the loudest glitches manage to exceed the background noise in this band and show up there as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Very cool! So a lot of parts reflect just not into the recieving sensor? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Yes a lot of things inside the vacuum vessels are shiny and reflective One can't simply paint everything flat black paints don't go well with vacuum Paint molecules would evaporate drift around and settle somewhere else even on the test masses where we absolutely don't want them The baffles get special coatings of non smooth light absorbing materials and even then their edges can still reflect some light But the total area of the large vacuum chambers and long beam tubes is just too much to treat it all in this way That said the mirrors which are meant to reflect light in the intended directions are of exceedingly high quality and almost all of the light does go where it is meant to go The coatings on the end test masses reflect more than of the laser light! And the few parts per million that get through these coatings aren't wasted They are captured by additional optics behind the test masses and are used to measure the circulating light power and the beam position and angle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Very cool! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Baby koi school https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423913/ School of melted blips https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423915/ Scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423919/ School koi plus ?

There's this thing about looking at the strain channel and an auxiliary channel side by side known as "Gravity Spy 0" > All those mis labelling at a larger scale Well I can't blame the old ML for not knowing what to do with a genuinely new kind of glitch but it needs to be watched by human eyes and should not be blindly trusted to feed Gravity Spy on Zooniverse with a decent distribution of easy and less easy subjects For that matter I myself shouldn't be blindly trusted by anyone either! I have neither the time nor the strength to keep looking at everything that needs to be looked at day in day out I keep making mistakes here and there like everyone for all my habitual sanity checking and proofreading before clicking the Submit button And there's too little double checking and critical feedback about my sometimes apodictic verdicts coming back to me https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ for the additional explanations Needless to say you keep doing an extraordinary job above and beyond on many fronts Regarding ML As seen from outside it seems that the vast amount of new glitch classes and newly found glitches known yet not proposed overwhelms the ML capacity and management to keep it updated improved even being more able to label correctly for example older glitches Regarding PEM > It would be interesting to learn what the PEM beamtube accelerometer aux channels have to say about all these glitches especially those near the four cryopumps at each site Right GS We would need to catch a pair of Livingston Main and PEM aux channels to pop up in the classifier related to the glitches being discussed to see what they say Then seeing and remembering that mainly only?

Good morning By looking again at the three Cairn glitches that I had collected of which you suspect above are Vibration Eruptions while sim search metadata is within what was defined earlier for Cairn I find them slightly different now in that the "mound" is broken or disheveled Most other Cairn form a more solid or structured full of bright energy mound Here is a look at page in my Cairn L collection turned all to frame Those suspected stand out now The pf is higher for these three subjects going from Hz through Hz while most of Cairn collected stay around Hz mainly the Hz range Perhaps this might be a hint? ! cairn vibration https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Excellent I fathom the huge job in building GS workflows and this proposed Cairn addition you mention would be fantastic if the team is able to do it Great explanations on this topic of PEM interest Many thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ It's intentional that the first two levels are traversed quickly and subsequent levels take longer not least because they need volunteer input and would be starved of input if people were advancing too quickly but submissions for which many thanks anyway! ought to be enough to unlock level Sanity check have you still been seeing occasional gold standard subjects e those which give feedback? If yes I would recommend you post a follow up in the other thread next door tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3398363?comment where the researchers are already watching Manually unlocking a level or three should not prevent further levels from being unlocked automatically once a number of gold standard submissions have been received which cover all classes for which such subjects exist https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ I have been seeing occasional gold standard subjects and usually I identify them correctly I'll try to reach subjects before responding to the thread you mentioned just to be sure https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Double tailed koifish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424977/ scattered light ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ I put this as none of the above however I think this might be koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Can the measuring equipment measure frequencies above 2048?

This is a good question and I don't know the answer After one of the hundreds of feedback control loops that normally cooperate to maintain a good lock had failed outright when one camera monitoring the beam alignment had stopped working there were multiple unusual things going on at once By the time the present subject was recorded a couple minutes later the Livingston interferometer had already drifted so far from its intended working point that a lockloss was less than seconds away Bits and pieces of this wandering line are visible in a number of subjects from the surrounding minutes tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk I haven't seen anything similar to it in any Livingston O subjects recorded in more normal conditions Do watch out though for a Wandering Line undulating more slowly in a few dozen Hanford O subjects from last January https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3064584/ Yes to fixes applied a few years ago most of it nowadays happens below the Hz bottom edge of our spectrograms we only get to see the topmost parts of the action https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ NOTA is fine when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes This subject shows a coincidental mix of two different independent glitches The tall central feature with hints of "lighthouse" decorations could be called a Blip although it's a bit of a stretch if it had been louder it would turn into a kind of Extremely Loud The "wheatgrass" surrounding it below Hz is a form of Scattered Light rendered as rows of beatnote pulses here because this subject was processed with very fine time resolution at the expense of very coarse frequency resolution The "fins" of a Koi Fish would look somewhat similar but more symmetric and at slightly higher frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ The raw data are recorded at a rate of samples per second so frequencies up to Hz could be extracted with some distortion and up to a little beyond Hz in sufficient quality to create images like ours this isn't normally done here since it costs extra memory and processing time and most glitches don't need it I don't have a timestamp for the present subject so I can't produce another image of this particular Whistle even though the raw data from the first three observing runs are public by now but see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2079928?comment page for some other examples and illustrations! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Another great question! Some old examples aside it is safe to assume that every Gravity Spy subject from recent and ongoing observing runs contains a glitch or rarely a real gravitational wave chirp something that exceeded the ever present background noise levels by at least a factor of But that Something isn't always visible in the resulting image The Gravity Spy tools tab Watch out for other NotNoGlitch subjects There are many with reported peak frequencies around or around Hz betraying a violin mode origin quite a few from Hanford at or Hz which tend to belong into a proposed new class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk some from Hanford at or Hz and more from Livingston at Hz which belong into another propopsed class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and some others https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ What happens when a participant chooses NOTA? Does it get sent to a higher level for further inspection? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ I just checked the datasets at gwosc to see if I could get the data from there but it looks like data from January to November is missing entirely? Why is this? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ First of all This is an extraneous subject there must exist another where the obvious extremely loud glitch appears properly centered I haven't seen it yet but it would probably look somewhat like tab recorded a day and a half earlier The difference in appearance is due to rendering choices coarse vs fine time resolution combined with fine vs coarse frequency resolution Why do we get such extraneous off center subjects? Mostly because the glitch detection software inspects minute long chunks of data at a time setting to work in near real time whenever another minute's worth of data has become available The "outskirts" of a loud glitch near the end of one chunk can then cause another spurious detection at the beginning of the next chunk as in this case or the onset of a loud glitch near the beginning of a fresh chunk can already have caused a spurious detection at the end of the preceding chunk Next This one did not cause a lockloss we see clean data with just the usual amount of faint random background noise everywhere in the right half of the fourth frame But similar glitches are among the loudest that a LIGO interferometer can with luck survive without losing its lock tab is one of the loudest such I've seen at an SNR above And even louder ones can cause a lockloss E this one did some seconds beyond the " s" right edge of the fourth frame ! frame What causes this kind of extremely loud glitches? Ultimately earthquakes or thunderclaps or very strong gusts of wind which despite the multi stage seismic isolation manage to cause one or more of the mirror suspensions to shake The feedback control loops which keep the arm length difference "DARM" constant to within a picometer a millionth of a micrometer and those which keep the test masses mirrors at their proper angles to allow the laser light to bounce back and forth between them more than a hundred times operate in a mode with limited actuation strength and low noise once the lock has been acquired They can compensate and damp some amount of unwanted motion but not a lot When more force would be needed than is available things will momentarily depart from the proper working point resulting in a sudden LOT of noise in the data and a loudspeaker in the control room will automatically issue a verbal alert like "EX saturation!" to the operator With luck acting a little longer with the limited force available may still suffice to recover from the disturbance or it may not the lock may be lost a fast shutter closes within milliseconds to protect the detection photodiodes the input laser power is ramped down the remaining circulating laser light ends up in beam dumps and the lock would need to be reacquired slowly The saturation and lockloss illustrated above at 19T was caused by an earthquake and goes with LLO tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ In case of a no glitch should I use the tools to see if this is really the case and then report as NOTA if there is something? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ I'll have a look at the tools I assume these should only be used when the glitch class isn't clear? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ In the long run yes or it may just be kept around until all the newly discovered glitch classes have been studied sufficiently to re train the Machine Learning and to make some of them official so that further submissions can then mark them as "one of the above" And in any case NOTA ensures that more people are going to get a look! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Because the first Observing Run of Advanced LIGO ended on and the second started on GWOSC only holds published data tab Engineering Runs are thus excluded weekly maintenance periods are excluded routine half hour calibration measurement periods are excluded and of course there are no data from times when the observatories weren't observing g recovering from a lockloss or weren't even running because of lengthy upgrades tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2800503?comment between observing runs https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ You mention SNR what is this a measurement of? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Ah ok so gravity spy uses all data? this subject is from https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Ah ok how accurate has the algorithm gotten so far? Anywhere I can read up on this? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ It's up to you how deeply you want to delve into each subject! Sometimes Similarity Search provides insights that aren't easy to come by in other ways Personally I am going to some extremes but I certainly don't expect everybody else to do so I will run a "NotNoGlitch" subject through a similarity search for result immediately based on the character identifier which I can already access while classifying just to see whether it belongs under Violin Modes or Low Frequency Lines or somewhere else Otherwise I'll just make a note of the subject number to return to it later I would usually add a subject to an appropriate collection only after it has been returned as a result from a small similarity search starting from another subject by which time I would also have written down the peak frequency and other metadata and eyeballed an approximate timestamp to within minutes or so and then I feed the collected subject's number back into another sim search to keep my to do queues populated I also keep track of how often each subject has appeared as a sim search result In this way I can gradually build collections of the most representative subjects of each kind Cascades of many small searches asking for rather fewer than results each time tend to work much better for exploring an underlying populations than doing only a few searches asking for many results Of course the tool being image based mixes up all the NotNoGlitch subjects https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ Signal to background Noise Ratio or in this case glitch noise level divided by background noise level https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ The "date" stamps of old subjects are dummy values reflecting the date on which the upload script was last modified Only since the fourth observing run do we have the real event date available through the nfo button Admittedly this is a little confusing but then almost all old subjects have been deactivated from the workflows in order to focus on the new material except for the gold standard subjects and for a selection of Whistles from O to make up for a total lack of Whistles from O so far The present subject dates from the first observing run and was uploaded to Zooniverse in October after results from a pilot phase of the budding project had been evaluated Subjects from later runs have the run number embedded in their titles after the observatory name https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ To be frank at the moment the Machine Learning is all over the place The glitch mix coming from the LIGO observatories during the ongoing fourth observing run differs very much from anything we've seen before and from everything the ML had previously been trained for We still have recognizable Blips and Koi Fish but Scattered Light looks very different now and there are many completely new things tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and some new things that look deceptively similar to old glitch classes that haven't reoccurred in years or whose causes have been completely eliminated in the course of observatory upgrades And changing anything in the ML takes time tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3369772?comment One fairly recent paper is Y Wu al Advancing Glitch Classification in Gravity Spy Multi view Fusion with Attention based Machine Learning for Advanced LIGO's Fourth Observing Run tab You'll find this along with a selection of older material linked from Talk > Help > Resources tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk very much for your sustained interest! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ for the comprehensive answer!

Why I am asking is When a volunteer switches among several devices or among several different browsers browser profiles on one device session state for which the single source of truth is on the server side will be fetched and cached and the new session will be in sync with where the previous session had left off But cookies won't carry over This might cause surprises If there's already other functional state that's kept in cookies then I'd expect fewer surprises But if not then a solution based on the existing per user per project project preferences stored server side and cached browser side might be preferable in the long term so as to have all such features work in similar ways The server side project preferences already remember in which workflow of the project I've been active most recently and if I'm not mistaken they are already being fetched by both frontends when a classifier is launched so the information would be available to the frontends it's just not being used at the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ I'll have a look at the paper you sent very much for the quick and helpful answers! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Fair enough https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ So 95440075's glitch is times louder ? clearer? brighter? than the background? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Yes that's it "Louder" is probably the best word Astronomers speak of a binary neutron star merger as a " standard siren tab The SNR is computed in relation to the small random background fluctuations not in relation to the DC light level Also ever present stationary noise a lot of it esp at low frequencies but also at a number of fixed higher frequencies is removed before considering the random background and computing SNRs Here's a plot of yesterday's stationary background noise levels from the detector status summary page for the day tab !

Indeed this was a completely new kind of glitch tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk first noted from LIGO Hanford on The cause remains unkown In late April another series of similar looking glitches happened again at Hanford during a couple of days And then from until we got a few hundred somewhat similar glitches from Livingston two of which are among your similarity search results In that case the cause is known it turned out tab Glitches from all three of these episodes have attracted a mix of low Q and high Q renderings so they differ widely in appearance If you want to see for yourself how a Blip changes in appearance under different rendering choices let's take one from O where the precise event timestamps and raw data have been published by now Head to the glitch plotter tab The same can be done with a published Binary Black Hole BBH chirp from O say GW tab Per the current version of the LIGO Data Management Plan tab way https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426474/ Yes the top of one arch just barely peeping over the bottom edge and then the top of a lesser parallel arch just above the dark Hz stationary noise band https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426516/ Because each of these baby Koi glitches is a very close overlapping double two humps at the top end and often a few dark holes down the middle where the two short duration things partially cancel https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426519/ Not too fuzzy just Scattered Light rendered at Q in between wheatgrass and scattering comb shapes https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ It hard working out which is which! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ I find it very difficult to make out Easily missed! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426516/ Be assured that you're miles ahead of the ML in this regard https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ ! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ I ve updated the GitHub PR to explain how a SameSite cookie protects against accidentally loading the wrong workflow when following a link from an email or external site https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ As a matter of interest maybe to others like myself what on earth is ConvNN? I have seen it when doing sim searches and should have asked this years ago It is something I doubt I will ever need to use but I am interested where it fits in to the whole AI ML scheme of things Please is there a VERY basic explanation? No hurry! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ Sorry to hear it I have passed the message on to the person who developed the promotion system and hope to have a fix soon https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ When I check though it says you are in level Could you reload the site and see what levels are unlocked? Or is it promotion to level that's not working? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Promotion to level is not working https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ A Convolutional Neural Network tab The simulated cells are arranged in layers The given image is divided into arrays of overlapping little squares The image data in each square are fed into one of the cells in the first layer Each of these input cells reacts to left right or up down or diagonal gradients brightness variations in its input square this is the "convolutional" part The outputs of the first layer cells in all sorts of combinations are processed further by the next layers Each successive layer is able to detect more complicated combinations of image traits straight or curved edges small or large uniform regions arches parallel streaks fuzziness Nessie coils After some four or five or six intermediate layers the final output layer consists of one cell for each glitch class or whatever one is trying to classify The one that "shouts most loudly" determines the label that will be attached to the image and how loudly it "shouts" compared to the others provides a confidence estimate During training the connections among the layers are strengthened or weakened at random until the outputs delivered on the training images agree reasonably well with the intended classifications This too aims to imitate how we understand learning to happen in real brains Hope this is suitably basic!

We are having a talk about AI in our village hall next month so I thought I would try and get my head around it Sorry I should have started a new chat conversation https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ Among the various O "NotNoGlitch" subjects a few hundred mostly from Hanford O4b stand out They have peak frequencies near or near Hz and are readily tied to logbook entries about rung up violin modes The Machine Learning has been calling them No Glitch and indeed there's nothing much to see yet Omicron had triggered on them as excess noise with SNRs above or else they wouldn't exist as Gravity Spy subjects But it turns out that they don't actually represent glitches in the strain channel They represent elevated stationary noise levels in DARM and strain varying only gradually on time scales of minutes to hours They really originate as glitches in the glitch detection itself Thus I'm documenting them here as a distinct subclass of Violin Mode Harmonics Proposed Name LIGO O Invisible Violins ID of proposer Date of proposal Reference subjects for Classifier and Field Guide S holotype linked above S S S ! frame showing the second frames Short description Nothing at all stands out visually Minor unrelated noise may be present The peak frequencies accessible through Similarity Search tab Characteristics As above SNRs rarely exceed All Q value choices can occur Overlapping pairs of subjects are unusually common see below Hash tags a Collections NB the metadata links do not work at present pending a DYCWMI tool bugfix but will work once the tool has been fixed no training set at this time since the current Machine Learning doesn't take Omicron metadata into account Bulk collections growing H ER O4a Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h er a invisible violins link to its metadata tab L ER O4a Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant l er a invisible violins link to its metadata tab H ER O4b Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h er b invisible violins link to its metadata tab L ER O4b Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant l er b invisible violins link to its metadata tab Collaborators Remarks In fact not only is there an unusual excess of overlapping pairs of subjects these pairs also straddle full second boundaries at one minute intervals The examples from all come just before or just after a GPS second that fell seconds after a multiple of Those from all happened seconds after a multiple of On the other hand the seconds periodicity tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk of the Pizzicato glitches from O has disappeared completely Example pairs more will keep turning up from between and UTC tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab and from between and UTC tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab What must have been happening here is that Omicron in the presence of a rung up violin mode or other loud stationary narrowband noise tends to trigger near the end of its current seconds chunk of data and then again near the beginning of the next seconds chunk Sometimes only one member of such a pair of triggers will exceed the SNR > threshold for creating a Gravity Spy subject Sometimes both would remain too faint to show up here https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ So what to do about these triggers? Are they useful? Are they necessary? Could we do without them? The observatory operators and the data quality team on their weekly shifts don't need them rung up violin modes are reported in other more direct ways They do add some spice to the Gravity Spy volunteer experience One more sort of thing that requires taking a closer look and extracting the peak frequency using the Similarity Search tool tab It is likely that they could be avoided by padding the minute long data chunks on which Omicron operates with shoulders of at least seconds on both sides my experience whilst working with the glitch plotter tab So it may be better to keep things as they are and live with these "glitches" It's worth noting that the Virgo team had encountered a very similar issue at the beginning of O tab O https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ For the record below I am listing documented episodes of rung up violin modes from which we've seen visible or invisible fallout as Gravity Spy subjects ER LHO LHO tab O4a LHO 04ff LHO tab LLO briefly very visible just before a lockloss see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk LHO and following ITMY mode and later Hz with a series of logbook entries including LHO tab LHO LHO tab LHO 28ff LHO tab LLO 28f LLO tab LHO LHO tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ ER none O4b LLO 15f LLO tab LHO LHO tab LHO LHO tab I have not yet seen any subjects from subequent episodes LHO LHO tab LLO LLO tab LLO 16ff LLO tab LLO 31ff LLO tab LLO LLO tab modes https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ The images fed to the GravitySpy ML ConvNN day in day out while the observatories are Observing are the same that then get uploaded to Zooniverse as subjects for us to inspect except that the ML gets to "view" all four frames at once side by side and without the title texts colourmap axis tick marks and labels only the four spectrogram images themselves For re training purposes it would be fed a set of around a hundred such images carefully selected and believed to be representative of a single new glitch class In reality it's somewhat more complicated The set is split up randomly into a larger part used for the training phase and a smaller part for testing validation Then the current training subset is run through the neural network adjusting the cell connections in the process and the outcome is evaluated on the current test subset while keeping the connections fixed And then this is repeated with a new random splitting of the given subject set many times until the results no longer improve in further iterations The sort of language oriented AI that has been getting headlines in the last year and a half ChatGPT and friends works completely differently though The only commonalities are that they also run on computers and also need to be trained But they require vastly larger amounts of training data and existing Large Language Models have been trained on data of sometimes extremely dubious quality not to mention copyright infringements on a global scale https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ No doubt people will want to know about ChatGPT I have never used it but have actually heard about it for your explanations https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ Lockloss https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428724/ School of koi https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428725/ Fuzzy range?

The title subject is a rare Q rendering of a flock as is The remainder of the sim search results is something of a mixed bunch Since the choice of Q value has such a large effect on the general texture of the resulting subject images the Similarity Search tool tends to be more sensitive to the Q value than to the glitch class And since flocks at Q are rare it returns an eclectic mix of other things instead Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Whether you're browsing recent pages or viewing the results of a logbook search is specific to your current browser session and can't be exported through a URL The link you see in the URL field of your browser when you're looking at the search results ends up pointing at the logbook start page for everyone else No loss in the present case since flocks aren't momentous enough as glitches go to earn specific logbook mentions Only individual logbook entries and comments on them can be linked to directly Their URLs can be captured for pasting by using the browser's "Copy link" function on the "Link" button in the entry heading https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ for the feedback and information An eclectic mix indeed as sim search sees it I took a look at the array of subjects tagged with "flock" there is a wide variety of glitches making up a flock seems pretty special > Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Yes I recalled something about this from previous logbook searches seeing that my draft post returned the Home page after having pasted the URL on top of the search results even though that search URL contained the corresponding "page 1" and "page 2" appended yet switched to the Home page when pasted into the address bar Many thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ ! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ The center object looks a bit odd https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ What is the top glitch? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ I just got promoted from gravity spy level to gravity spy level So manually promoting may have fixed it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I would be very grateful if I could be manually promoted to Level Four as I have been on Level Three for sometime and yet Level Four is still locked Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi Brian While this is a very old glitch from I'd say that it looks like Blip ssp trumpetfish proposed This dated glitch brings back the sim search problem of duplicates where after a recent fix in this regard it no longer runs on older subjects having multiple identical copies returning the message " Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site " Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Is this scattered light ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Ah so the same glitch is still out there just with a different ID? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Tiny dot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ Hi for your interest If I understood correctly your question each subject has a unique subject id and then a random subject number assigned across all Zooniverse subjects As of this seeming Trumpetfish there are many subjects that fit the subclass definition each having a different subject id Yes Trumpetfish seems to be still around to date as is the case with many other classes and subclasses Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ The glitches visible in the strain channel are classic multi arch Scattered Light the kind that was still common during most of the third observing run before it got fixed in January The auxiliary channel which monitors the light circulating in the X arm represented by the few parts per million of it which make it through the mirror coatings on the end test mass and then get captured by the optics of the transmission monitoring system didn't witness it on this occasion The present S is a counterpart to S https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ Nice catch! This and similar subjects mostly from Hanford with brief sometimes repeating noise near and or around Hz are None Of The Above Sometimes we call them "Pirate Ships" by a superficial analogy with the old Virgo O glitch class of that name At Hanford they are caused by beam jitter they show up when the laser beam already wobbles sideways a little at the point where it enters the first vacuum chamber The subset near Hz got almost completely fixed in October the others still occur occasionally They are relatively rare They may yet earn a formal glitch class proposal once we've collected enough examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Another kind of None Of The Above These require a glance at the Similarity Search tool tab ended https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ To clarify this is primarily a gold standard example of Repeating Blips intended to familiarize volunteers in the level workflow with cases where groups of individual glitchlets need to be treated as a whole and where it is essential to look at the fourth frame and take in the whole picture And I agree on the central constituent blip being slightly mis shapen because it is coincidentally blended with a bit of unrelated lower frequency noise In some cases ancient subjects that had already been uploaded once before the Gravity Spy tools existed to serve as gold standard examples were uploaded a second time later as ordinary subjects with new subject numbers and were then also added to the Similarity Search tool's database Thus Sim Search won't find the present subject under its original number but a search for the character subject id uniqueid IdrpGAG37s will succeed and will find the copy with subject number Note that the image was reprocessed for this purpose In the newer copy the image title mentions the first observing run O explicitly https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ for the clarification Indeed it is important to look at the four frames and I had done so as usual just overlooked mentioning it I had seen the repeating glitches found them to be too unclear to determine which type of Blip they are and then focused around https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ GS promotion uses a different system You need to classify in level of GS to get to level of GS so let me know if that happens or not https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I promoted you as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ for the promotion to Level I did classify on that level which did then allowed me to be promoted to do Level classifications again for all your help with this issue I really enjoy classifying the many new glitches! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Almost no background noise! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Got this error message while searching for glitches similar to the subject Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site I guess it may be related to several lockloss events happened during that day but the shape is quite weird and I cannot obtain any rather fine timestamp for this subject for further correlation to be honest I am not even sure with what can I correlate besides logbook and detector status page Anyway would be happy to know if it is normal to have some subject present on zooniverse website and missing somewhere else as well as get some tips on how to treat such examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Apologies for the invoncenience! Last year there were occasional hiccups with the subject upload process which resulted in repeated upload attempts and thus in accidental duplications and it has not been feasible to clean up completely afterwards The present glitch is one of that happened between and at Hanford cause unknown and not related to locklosses but nearly each of them was uploaded to Zooniverse five times under five different subject numbers without making it into the Gravity Spy tools before finally being successfully uploaded a sixth time The good and usable subjects from those days have numbers 9636xxxx the earlier 9287xxxx through 9343xxxx should be considered as extraneous duplicates If we were to remove them from Zooniverse now we would also orphan the associated Talk threads and produce inconsistencies in any collections containing them The usable version of the present subject is tab As to how to deal with the duplicates I would frown at them flag them as such by adding them to suitable marker collections and move on to the next subject There's also a small handful of subjects showing other kinds of glitches of which two or more copies exist in the Similarity Seach database and these can produce a different nondescript error when one asks for fewer results than the number of copies There used to be many more during O many subjects had been ingested four or five times and there was one that had got uploaded more than a thousand times those had been cleared out at one point leaving only one representative subject of each glitch Clearing out the few that exist at the present time would require a disproportionate amount of manual effort so we've left them alone https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ oki thanks for clarification! Recently I started getting glitches from this sequence one after another but was unable to find any info in Talk Btw how did you manage to find usable version of the subject in question? Definitely not by brute forcing subject IDs matching right? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Yes well observed you'll see this in a number of ancient subjects If I am not mistaken the reason is that back then well before my time the normalized noise energy was fed into the colormap as is whereas more recent subjects use the logarithm of the normalized energy which will show some finer glitch details as well as the random background more clearly Noise levels within a single subject image can vary by five orders of magnitude even after the removal of stationary noise "whitening" during preprocessing https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ One of our veteran volunteers who is currently taking a break from Zooniverse had collected almost all of these two hundred something Hz glitch subjects as they come up whilst classifying Once our systematic similarity searches across the good ones found no further examples it was a matter of looking at each of the good ones in turn find its exact copies in the twenty odd collection pages where twelve subject per page are displayed write down the relationships in an offline file and remove the copies from the bulk collection so this eyeball search became easier with each glitch that we had dealt with A few duplicates had been missed and only showed up later and these could be tied in by eyeballing the collection of good representatives which fits on pages https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Can someone shed some light on what to classify this one please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ I have seen quite a few of these "512" short lines How to classify please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ I see a few of these strong solid line at Classification same as ripple? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ I have not seen this type before Any thoughts? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/ So some of the fainter glitches g scratchy were just not visible back then? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Scattered light with somerhing faint above very faint blip maybe? I put this as NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430538/ Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and thank you for contributing! None Of The Above is always an option whenever something doesn't want to fit easily into the available classes And this is often the case at present During the fourth observing run that's now in progress after three years of upgrades tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2800503?comment the LIGO interferometers have been producing a glitch mix that's very different from anything we had seen before Some old glitch classes still occur in recognizable forms some still occur but look different some no longer occur and quite a few completely new things tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk have been coming up The present subject comes from a brief episode on tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk when one of Livingston's feedback control loops had failed and over the course of a mere three minutes the interferometer drifted so far from its working point that the lock was lost We already see multiple things going on at once here repeating blips violin mode harmonics a wandering line While it's not at all obvious it was one of the repeating blips that triggered this subject But None Of The Above is certainly appropriate too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ None Of The Above They were a completely new and unexpected thing tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk when they suddenly started happening in large numbers during three days in late May and early June https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ Well noted! Again I would recommend None Of The Above These Hz glitches were another new thing when they showed up on at Hanford and then stopped happening again at the end of the month Only such glitches seem to have been recorded too few to justify a formal glitch class proposal the cause remains a mystery Around that time there were hiccups with the uploading of subjects to the Gravity Spy tools tab The Ripples have not reoccurred in the 3rd and 4th observing runs but there are some lookalikes that have been confusing the Gravity Spy Machine Learning too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ Yet another type of None Of The Above! These mini jolts like the Hz glitches come from beam jitter when the laser beam wobbles sideways by a tiny amount already before it enters the first vacuum chamber On this particular occasion on technicians had been pulling fiber cables under the raised floors near the control room to connect a fire alarm panel The connection to these glitches was soon noted tab Why not start a collection of these? It will come in helpful There isn't a formal glitch class proposal for these jitter glitches yet but I guess there have been enough of them to justify one once we can support it with collections of representative subjects https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/ They would have been visible when they occurred on their own thanks to the energy normalization but not when anything louder was also present https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Well observed! Yes that's a blip up there and looking at the reported peak frequency of Hz it was what triggered this subject although the image rendering then paid more attention to the accompanying scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430538/ Not sure if I should post it here but I didn't find any other suitable board to post it in anyway For the past days since I switched to level I constantly get similar subjects Sometimes they go one after another sometimes zooniverse put 'golden' subjects between them but what I mostly get is either H O Hz transient lines which do not have a clickable classification for them but were described in details in this thread Example https imgur com a AGZbIwX https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3430635/ https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3430635/ No problem and glad to hear that it worked and you're enjoying it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ the true chirp !

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The characteristic of these glitches is that they represent elevated stationary noise levels in DARM and strain, varying only gradually, which often do not visually stand out in spectrograms. These glitches are suggested to be from elevated stationary noise levels rather than actual strain variations, making them "invisible" in terms of direct impact on visual data.\n   - **URL Variables**: `gravity-spy/talk/328/3430821/`, `gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/`\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - **Classification of "NonNoGlitch" and "Violin Mode Harmonics"**: There\'s an expressed concern about the classification of certain glitches being called "No Glitch" by Machine Learning when they should be classified under existing categories like Violin Mode Harmonics. These instances highlight issues with the ML algorithm not correctly identifying known patterns.\n   - **URL Variables**: `gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/`, `gravity-spy/talk/328/3430834/`\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - Participants in Talk Dataset 2 show an increased curiosity about the underlying technical aspects and accurate classification of glitches. For example, questions arise about Convolutional Neural Networks and their role in glitch classification, indicating a deepening interest in the technical framework behind the Gravity Spy project.\n   - There is a specific inquiry into the distinction between different types of glitches at various Q-values, showing a nuanced approach to understanding glitch appearances under different data processing settings.\n   - **URL Variables**: `gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/`, `gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/`\n\n4. **Hypotheses about Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Beam Jitter**: Some glitches are hypothesized to originate from beam jitter, where the laser beam wobbles before entering the vacuum chamber. This hypothesis is supported by observations of technicians working near sensitive equipment, correlating physical disturbances with glitch occurrences.\n   - **Environmental Factors**: There\'s an ongoing discussion about the impact of environmental factors like seismic activities and their correlation with glitch events, specifically noting instances like earthquakes impacting sensor readings.\n   - **URL Variables**: `gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/`, `gravity-spy/talk/328/3430834/`\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - There are discussions about specific sensors or channels affecting the type and visibility of glitches. For instance, the way certain glitches appear or are classified may depend on which sensor channel is being analyzed, leading to questions about the consistency and reliability of sensor outputs across different channels.\n   - This reflects a growing sophistication in the understanding of participants about how data acquisition and processing can affect glitch identification and classification.\n   - **URL Variables**: `gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/`, `gravity-spy/talk/328/3430834/`', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1725739866, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_6f7679d977', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=664, prompt_tokens=22985, total_tokens=23649))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

It definitely endorses me to dive into gravity spy data again and again knowing my questions are going to be addressed in a very comprehensive and friendly manner I will definitely try to get familiar with similarity search tool so far I am trying to establish some kind of a pipeline of subsequent actions which one should do in general to investigate different glitches I've just started to understand time frequency resolution tradeoffs which on its own is kind of hard to wrap one's head around now there are additional tools At least it seems to me there are so many different sources to consider but I've got a feeling something settles in my head at last https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3416650/ sounds like a plan! Do take it easy though Rome LIGO wasn't built in a day and there's no substitute for experience acquired over many weeks months and years Keep going and experience will settle on your shoulders like snow on a tree My personal subject studying routine is somewhat complicated but it has evolved over more then five years and is underpinned by having looked at more than a hundred thousand glitches and by keeping long lists of subject numbers and annotations in offline files Let me recommend one additional source of information It's worth keeping a corner of an eye on what other people both veterans and new volunteers are posting in our Talk boards tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk There are some gems to be found also among comments from past years so when you're just finishing classifying something interesting looking you can click Done Talk instead of Done to see the subject's Talk page and any prior discussions linked from it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3416650/ Since at least July to date there are several mentions in Talk of a pending DYCWMI tool bugfix to have it work with ER and O subjects I tried the tool today and it still returns a No data available in table Being already through O4b the tool is much needed for volunteer glitch investigations by offering collection metadata at a glance to observe ranges group characteristics and more As external text editing files are to be used to investigate glitches in the absence of the DYCWMI tool a manual copy paste is required for collections in painstaking manual work subject by subject for what the tool would automatically provide Even further histograms are important visualization tools to determine how the population distribution of collections behaves In the absence of an automated collection histogram it is very challenging to try to create an external distribution chart because with event time metadata null in sim search until O data is publicly released the event date needs to be manually extracted from each spectrogram through the Info button be manually added to each subject metadata row in that external file then processed and finetuned Repeat this many times till an investigation turns satisfactory enough The DYCWMI tool is very useful to the community at large and is vital to round up information and decisions as investigative collections evolve into final curated sets with all information ready for the to consider I would like to hear about the status of the tool bugfix and when it would be expected to be operational with ER and O collections for your attention and all efforts done by the teams to fix bugs all along Sincerely Carmen https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3421335/ Wheatgrass or LF blip? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421450/ Tomte koi https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421452/ Scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421454/ Is this vaguely cairn ish? 71Hz Q NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421457/ Ripple comb? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421458/ Extremely loud is there an anglerfish in there? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421460/ Anglerfish flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421462/ 12Hz 11 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421464/ Melted blip 26Hz but I went for NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421470/ Slightly fuzzy? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421472/ Fuzzy range 78Hz 22 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421474/ Anglerfish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421477/ Fuzzy range 22 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421480/ line 52Hz https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421484/ Baby koi flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421485/ Lighthouse koi https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421486/ Off centre Marie Celeste NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3400372/ Repeating blips https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421487/ Flock of ?

This would be visible or absent when you click on Done Talk and scroll down a bit The ratio would allow an estimate how many such subjects there exist in total E if roughly every fifth is currently already in the collection then the total number should be around a thousand since I currently have circa and counting collected https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421500/ Sixty seven Nessie coil subjects as far as I've seen so far at most a few very faint ones might still be missing plus the onset tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421501/ I had assumed you needed more of them to be a flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421487/ I can try but have my family coming to stay this weekend https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421500/ Yes queried that a while ago I had thought flock was wrong for a fish School as opposed to shoal then Nothing wrong with being the Daily Pedant https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421485/ Yes can do now I have re read your post after the weekend https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421500/ Doesn't quite look like koi fish more like a very messy road type glitch coming off what might be a very loud or a forest https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422187/ In fact I only learned about the subtle shoal school of fish difference from the linked Wikipedia page after I had looked it up the first time in order to cite it in a Talk comment So it's a school when they're neatly "swimming in the same direction in a coordinated manner" As our Koi babies do in the present subject https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421485/ Yes there's something Extremely Loud centered near the left edge of frame This event probably triggered a properly centered subject as well some seconds earlier than the present subject but I haven't seen it yet https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422187/ Similar to violin mode harmonic but not exactly it? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3121188/ Small sinusoidal wave cool! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Yes violin mode harmonics were one part of the story but there was much else going on during those minutes and the trigger for the present subject happened to be the fainter looking noise around Hz at time seconds So technically this would be more of a case of Repeating Blips but the whole combination is unsual enough that None Of The Above is perhaps the best choice If you're curious here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk is a longer illustrated explanation https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3121188/ this was unique event see A tale of two locklosses and other lists Subject sorry I posted this as duplicate https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3121188/ Pretty catch yes! What's less cool from a LIGO engineer's point of view is that this has been the most common type of glitch at Livingston since the beginning of the fourth observing run in May and it is still not clear how exactly these glitches arise We no longer get the sort of multi arch Scattered Light that was common in past years and that's illustrated in the Field Guide that sort was root caused in late tab The two arches are separated by a darker band covering Hz punctuated by three evenly spaced streaks tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk that's a region where there's a lot of always present stationary background noise which gets suppressed before our images are created So it's a new variant of lower frequency Scattered Light but it's unclear where the scattering happens at the corner station or near one of the two test masses at the ends of the arms and it's unclear what the reflecting item is that's moving relative to the test masses https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Huh so if I understand it correctly something is moving which causes the laser to move slightly thus registering as a "quake" I don't know the appropiate terminolgy sorry and you don't yet know what exactly is moving? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Rapid cycling glitches with the tips being the loudest almost flame like with a very quiet baseline maybe suppressed in this resolution? between about and 72Hz and the tips between about and 400Hz with a frequency of about 125s between peaks https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422780/ A pair of koi fish with the heads centered at about and 0s and a blip centered at about 8s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422784/ Whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/157809/ Lfb https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423032/ Background noise much more vibrant in this one! Something weird happened here https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Yes! We're living on a restless planet Even aside from earthquakes strong enough to be felt the ground beneath our feet is always in motion at speeds of up to about a micrometer per second caused by a mix of weak distant earthquakes wind driven ocean wave activity human activity plus gusts of wind leaning on building walls which then lean on the pillars which support them which then causes the floor under the pillars to tilt a little LIGO's vacuum chambers and the beam tubes connecting them along with anything attached to the walls of the vacuum vessels follow these ground motions Inside four of the large vacuum chambers at each site there are the test masses in their four stage "quad" pendulum suspensions mounted on a three stage internal seismic isolation structure mounted in turn on a hydraulic external pre isolation For some pictures of the hardware see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk So the test masses move a whole lot less than everything around them Between the polished mirror coated front surfaces of the test masses in each arm the main laser beams are circulating Tiny imperfections of the coatings cause a tiny fraction of the laser light to be scattered out of the beams in arbitrary directions Most of the stray light hits one of many baffles and is absorbed A tiny fraction of the stray light however may hit something reflective attached to the walls which are moving relative to the test masses A tiny fraction of the reflected light may hit the nearest test mass again and get scattered back to interfere with the main beam This fraction is what ultimately shows up as glitches If the stray light path length was constant it wouldn't be a problem the backscattered light may be out of phase with the main beam but that's no different from one test mass being a tiny wee little bit in the wrong place which would be automatically corrected But since the reflecting item would be moving relative to the test mass the stray light path length will also change and the phase relationship between the backscattered light and the main beam will change If the stray light path length changes by say s which is approximately laser wavelengths per second we'll get visible noise at about Hz Moreover multiple reflections can cause the stray light path to be traversed multiple times and then we'll also get visible noise at higher frequencies stacks of parallel arches The top of an arch always corresponds to the moment when the reflecting item was moving fastest in one direction or the other relative to the test mass At moments when the motion stops and turns around the arches descend off the bottom of our images The hunt for the causes involves careful analysis of videos of the near infrared light and actively shaking the beam tubes and measuring the effects both with accelerometers mounted on the beam tubes and chambers and in the light that ultimately reaches the detection photodiodes One recent logbook entry among many is LLO tab LIGO Livingston's X end test mass in its suspension center seen from rear left to its right is the suspended reaction mass with circular electrostatic actuator traces plated on it the angular structure on the left is the Arm Cavity Baffle All of the illumination captured here by the camera comes from stray laser light ! LLO ETMX quad Those gold plated electrostatic traces used to be the reflecting item responsible for the classic multi arch Scattered Light glitches during past observing runs This has been addressed since January by more carefully steering the suspensions to keep the distance between each test mass and the reaction mass behind it very nearly constant Any remaining glitches from this path would now occur below Hz where we won't see them in our subject images Looking a little further to the left with the test mass out of view beyond the right edge we now have the Arm Cavity Baffle on the right the cryopump baffle with two glints on its right edge left of center and a on the left a rather bright double glint off a spool piece where there's a large gate valve in the X arm beam tube The corner station would be km further away at rear left ! LLO glints near the end of the X arm Images from the LIGO logbooks courtesy Caltech MIT LIGO Laboratory tab The cryopump baffle is unlikely to be "it" they used to vibrate quite a lot in the presence of elevated ground motion levels and they were responsible for a lot of glitches during O but steps have since been taken to prevent them from vibrating The spool piece might be "it" but this has neither been proven nor ruled out yet The changes in the light path length implied by the frequencies of our arches seem a bit too large for it the spool piece shouldn't be able to move that much Hope this helps a little! By the way note that we don't see the main beam in these images There are more than kW of laser light circulating along earch arm between the reflecting surfaces of the input and end test masses but everything is happening inside a hard vacuum Thus there are next to no air molecules anywhere between the test masses that would scatter some light out of the beam towards the camera as they would if the beam was travelling in air https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ This is a rather common form that Scattered Light glitches from Hanford have been taking during the ongoing fourth observing run No well formed arches just wavy more or less parallel bits and fragments at frequencies mostly between and Hz sometimes with additional pieces between and Hz The band between and Hz tends to appear dark in most of our images It is blanketed by loud stationary noise which gets suppressed before our spectrogram images are created Only the loudest glitches manage to exceed the background noise in this band and show up there as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Very cool! So a lot of parts reflect just not into the recieving sensor? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Yes a lot of things inside the vacuum vessels are shiny and reflective One can't simply paint everything flat black paints don't go well with vacuum Paint molecules would evaporate drift around and settle somewhere else even on the test masses where we absolutely don't want them The baffles get special coatings of non smooth light absorbing materials and even then their edges can still reflect some light But the total area of the large vacuum chambers and long beam tubes is just too much to treat it all in this way That said the mirrors which are meant to reflect light in the intended directions are of exceedingly high quality and almost all of the light does go where it is meant to go The coatings on the end test masses reflect more than of the laser light! And the few parts per million that get through these coatings aren't wasted They are captured by additional optics behind the test masses and are used to measure the circulating light power and the beam position and angle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Very cool! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Baby koi school https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423913/ School of melted blips https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423915/ Scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423919/ School koi plus ?

For example a one line subject is gold subject In my opinion a cairn should need several prominent elements piled up not just a slightly curved single line Hence do we consider the very faint lines as defining elements?

One possibility I've been mulling over and which may turn out to be wrong is that Cairns might be another part of the same population as Vibration Eruptions tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 1009409?comment where in the latter case the reflecting item the cryopump baffles used to be the prime suspect would be vibrating with larger amplitude thus upconverting the noise to higher frequencies at the culmination and as a byproduct also raising the decay phase which lasts a few seconds to frequencies above Hz where it doesn't get completely drowned out by the stationary background noise Like Cairns Vibration Eruptions attract renderings at a variety of Q values and they are roughly equally rare In this light it is interesting that you've picked up three in between subjects that I would be inclined to file under Vibration Eruption ! frame and tab which has just brought up in Talk may be yet another in between case It would be interesting to learn what the PEM beamtube accelerometer aux channels have to say about all these glitches especially those near the four cryopumps at each site By the way last week I had added another O3b example with renderings at all four Q values of a plausible Cairn to an earlier entry on the first page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3399349?comment of this present thread https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Noting in passing that there are other ongoing mislabeling issues on an even larger scale Hundreds of O4b glitches caused by rung up Violin Mode Harmonics have been getting mis labeled as No Glitch by the ML and have been placed into entry level workflows where they'll get mis classified as such by new volunteers too And lots of higher Q renderings of glitches peaking near Hz from Livingston " Hz monster" fuzzy range week tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3314162?comment to have been mis labeled as Power Line and have likewise wound up in the entry level workflows https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ for the feedback and explanations Interesting to see for how many years Vibration Eruptions have lived through If I picked three subjects that may fit this other class there is always a possibility that one belongs to the other Regarding the Vibration proposal > Shorter duration version lasts almost sec but it is usually longer sec long vibration glitch is not unusual Duration above would not fit Cairn O preliminary characteristics Subspecies perhaps?

There's this thing about looking at the strain channel and an auxiliary channel side by side known as "Gravity Spy 0" > All those mis labelling at a larger scale Well I can't blame the old ML for not knowing what to do with a genuinely new kind of glitch but it needs to be watched by human eyes and should not be blindly trusted to feed Gravity Spy on Zooniverse with a decent distribution of easy and less easy subjects For that matter I myself shouldn't be blindly trusted by anyone either! I have neither the time nor the strength to keep looking at everything that needs to be looked at day in day out I keep making mistakes here and there like everyone for all my habitual sanity checking and proofreading before clicking the Submit button And there's too little double checking and critical feedback about my sometimes apodictic verdicts coming back to me https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ for the additional explanations Needless to say you keep doing an extraordinary job above and beyond on many fronts Regarding ML As seen from outside it seems that the vast amount of new glitch classes and newly found glitches known yet not proposed overwhelms the ML capacity and management to keep it updated improved even being more able to label correctly for example older glitches Regarding PEM > It would be interesting to learn what the PEM beamtube accelerometer aux channels have to say about all these glitches especially those near the four cryopumps at each site Right GS We would need to catch a pair of Livingston Main and PEM aux channels to pop up in the classifier related to the glitches being discussed to see what they say Then seeing and remembering that mainly only?

Good morning By looking again at the three Cairn glitches that I had collected of which you suspect above are Vibration Eruptions while sim search metadata is within what was defined earlier for Cairn I find them slightly different now in that the "mound" is broken or disheveled Most other Cairn form a more solid or structured full of bright energy mound Here is a look at page in my Cairn L collection turned all to frame Those suspected stand out now The pf is higher for these three subjects going from Hz through Hz while most of Cairn collected stay around Hz mainly the Hz range Perhaps this might be a hint? ! cairn vibration https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Excellent I fathom the huge job in building GS workflows and this proposed Cairn addition you mention would be fantastic if the team is able to do it Great explanations on this topic of PEM interest Many thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ It's intentional that the first two levels are traversed quickly and subsequent levels take longer not least because they need volunteer input and would be starved of input if people were advancing too quickly but submissions for which many thanks anyway! ought to be enough to unlock level Sanity check have you still been seeing occasional gold standard subjects e those which give feedback? If yes I would recommend you post a follow up in the other thread next door tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3398363?comment where the researchers are already watching Manually unlocking a level or three should not prevent further levels from being unlocked automatically once a number of gold standard submissions have been received which cover all classes for which such subjects exist https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ I have been seeing occasional gold standard subjects and usually I identify them correctly I'll try to reach subjects before responding to the thread you mentioned just to be sure https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Double tailed koifish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424977/ scattered light ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ I put this as none of the above however I think this might be koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Can the measuring equipment measure frequencies above 2048?

This is a good question and I don't know the answer After one of the hundreds of feedback control loops that normally cooperate to maintain a good lock had failed outright when one camera monitoring the beam alignment had stopped working there were multiple unusual things going on at once By the time the present subject was recorded a couple minutes later the Livingston interferometer had already drifted so far from its intended working point that a lockloss was less than seconds away Bits and pieces of this wandering line are visible in a number of subjects from the surrounding minutes tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk I haven't seen anything similar to it in any Livingston O subjects recorded in more normal conditions Do watch out though for a Wandering Line undulating more slowly in a few dozen Hanford O subjects from last January https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3064584/ Yes to fixes applied a few years ago most of it nowadays happens below the Hz bottom edge of our spectrograms we only get to see the topmost parts of the action https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ NOTA is fine when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes This subject shows a coincidental mix of two different independent glitches The tall central feature with hints of "lighthouse" decorations could be called a Blip although it's a bit of a stretch if it had been louder it would turn into a kind of Extremely Loud The "wheatgrass" surrounding it below Hz is a form of Scattered Light rendered as rows of beatnote pulses here because this subject was processed with very fine time resolution at the expense of very coarse frequency resolution The "fins" of a Koi Fish would look somewhat similar but more symmetric and at slightly higher frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ The raw data are recorded at a rate of samples per second so frequencies up to Hz could be extracted with some distortion and up to a little beyond Hz in sufficient quality to create images like ours this isn't normally done here since it costs extra memory and processing time and most glitches don't need it I don't have a timestamp for the present subject so I can't produce another image of this particular Whistle even though the raw data from the first three observing runs are public by now but see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2079928?comment page for some other examples and illustrations! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Another great question! Some old examples aside it is safe to assume that every Gravity Spy subject from recent and ongoing observing runs contains a glitch or rarely a real gravitational wave chirp something that exceeded the ever present background noise levels by at least a factor of But that Something isn't always visible in the resulting image The Gravity Spy tools tab Watch out for other NotNoGlitch subjects There are many with reported peak frequencies around or around Hz betraying a violin mode origin quite a few from Hanford at or Hz which tend to belong into a proposed new class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk some from Hanford at or Hz and more from Livingston at Hz which belong into another propopsed class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and some others https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ What happens when a participant chooses NOTA? Does it get sent to a higher level for further inspection? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ I just checked the datasets at gwosc to see if I could get the data from there but it looks like data from January to November is missing entirely? Why is this? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ First of all This is an extraneous subject there must exist another where the obvious extremely loud glitch appears properly centered I haven't seen it yet but it would probably look somewhat like tab recorded a day and a half earlier The difference in appearance is due to rendering choices coarse vs fine time resolution combined with fine vs coarse frequency resolution Why do we get such extraneous off center subjects? Mostly because the glitch detection software inspects minute long chunks of data at a time setting to work in near real time whenever another minute's worth of data has become available The "outskirts" of a loud glitch near the end of one chunk can then cause another spurious detection at the beginning of the next chunk as in this case or the onset of a loud glitch near the beginning of a fresh chunk can already have caused a spurious detection at the end of the preceding chunk Next This one did not cause a lockloss we see clean data with just the usual amount of faint random background noise everywhere in the right half of the fourth frame But similar glitches are among the loudest that a LIGO interferometer can with luck survive without losing its lock tab is one of the loudest such I've seen at an SNR above And even louder ones can cause a lockloss E this one did some seconds beyond the " s" right edge of the fourth frame ! frame What causes this kind of extremely loud glitches? Ultimately earthquakes or thunderclaps or very strong gusts of wind which despite the multi stage seismic isolation manage to cause one or more of the mirror suspensions to shake The feedback control loops which keep the arm length difference "DARM" constant to within a picometer a millionth of a micrometer and those which keep the test masses mirrors at their proper angles to allow the laser light to bounce back and forth between them more than a hundred times operate in a mode with limited actuation strength and low noise once the lock has been acquired They can compensate and damp some amount of unwanted motion but not a lot When more force would be needed than is available things will momentarily depart from the proper working point resulting in a sudden LOT of noise in the data and a loudspeaker in the control room will automatically issue a verbal alert like "EX saturation!" to the operator With luck acting a little longer with the limited force available may still suffice to recover from the disturbance or it may not the lock may be lost a fast shutter closes within milliseconds to protect the detection photodiodes the input laser power is ramped down the remaining circulating laser light ends up in beam dumps and the lock would need to be reacquired slowly The saturation and lockloss illustrated above at 19T was caused by an earthquake and goes with LLO tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ In case of a no glitch should I use the tools to see if this is really the case and then report as NOTA if there is something? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ I'll have a look at the tools I assume these should only be used when the glitch class isn't clear? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ In the long run yes or it may just be kept around until all the newly discovered glitch classes have been studied sufficiently to re train the Machine Learning and to make some of them official so that further submissions can then mark them as "one of the above" And in any case NOTA ensures that more people are going to get a look! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Because the first Observing Run of Advanced LIGO ended on and the second started on GWOSC only holds published data tab Engineering Runs are thus excluded weekly maintenance periods are excluded routine half hour calibration measurement periods are excluded and of course there are no data from times when the observatories weren't observing g recovering from a lockloss or weren't even running because of lengthy upgrades tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2800503?comment between observing runs https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ You mention SNR what is this a measurement of? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Ah ok so gravity spy uses all data? this subject is from https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Ah ok how accurate has the algorithm gotten so far? Anywhere I can read up on this? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ It's up to you how deeply you want to delve into each subject! Sometimes Similarity Search provides insights that aren't easy to come by in other ways Personally I am going to some extremes but I certainly don't expect everybody else to do so I will run a "NotNoGlitch" subject through a similarity search for result immediately based on the character identifier which I can already access while classifying just to see whether it belongs under Violin Modes or Low Frequency Lines or somewhere else Otherwise I'll just make a note of the subject number to return to it later I would usually add a subject to an appropriate collection only after it has been returned as a result from a small similarity search starting from another subject by which time I would also have written down the peak frequency and other metadata and eyeballed an approximate timestamp to within minutes or so and then I feed the collected subject's number back into another sim search to keep my to do queues populated I also keep track of how often each subject has appeared as a sim search result In this way I can gradually build collections of the most representative subjects of each kind Cascades of many small searches asking for rather fewer than results each time tend to work much better for exploring an underlying populations than doing only a few searches asking for many results Of course the tool being image based mixes up all the NotNoGlitch subjects https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ Signal to background Noise Ratio or in this case glitch noise level divided by background noise level https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ The "date" stamps of old subjects are dummy values reflecting the date on which the upload script was last modified Only since the fourth observing run do we have the real event date available through the nfo button Admittedly this is a little confusing but then almost all old subjects have been deactivated from the workflows in order to focus on the new material except for the gold standard subjects and for a selection of Whistles from O to make up for a total lack of Whistles from O so far The present subject dates from the first observing run and was uploaded to Zooniverse in October after results from a pilot phase of the budding project had been evaluated Subjects from later runs have the run number embedded in their titles after the observatory name https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ To be frank at the moment the Machine Learning is all over the place The glitch mix coming from the LIGO observatories during the ongoing fourth observing run differs very much from anything we've seen before and from everything the ML had previously been trained for We still have recognizable Blips and Koi Fish but Scattered Light looks very different now and there are many completely new things tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and some new things that look deceptively similar to old glitch classes that haven't reoccurred in years or whose causes have been completely eliminated in the course of observatory upgrades And changing anything in the ML takes time tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3369772?comment One fairly recent paper is Y Wu al Advancing Glitch Classification in Gravity Spy Multi view Fusion with Attention based Machine Learning for Advanced LIGO's Fourth Observing Run tab You'll find this along with a selection of older material linked from Talk > Help > Resources tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk very much for your sustained interest! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ for the comprehensive answer!

Just a question for my own understanding I'm aware that a fair amount of browser side Zooniverse state both PFE and FEM is cached in session storage Are cookies currently also being used for anything aside from authentication and statistics gathering? Or would this be the first use of cookies for maintaining functional state? Why I am asking is When a volunteer switches among several devices or among several different browsers browser profiles on one device session state for which the single source of truth is on the server side will be fetched and cached and the new session will be in sync with where the previous session had left off But cookies won't carry over This might cause surprises If there's already other functional state that's kept in cookies then I'd expect fewer surprises But if not then a solution based on the existing per user per project project preferences stored server side and cached browser side might be preferable in the long term so as to have all such features work in similar ways The server side project preferences already remember in which workflow of the project I've been active most recently and if I'm not mistaken they are already being fetched by both frontends when a classifier is launched so the information would be available to the frontends it's just not being used at the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ I'll have a look at the paper you sent very much for the quick and helpful answers! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Fair enough https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ So 95440075's glitch is times louder ? clearer? brighter? than the background? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Yes that's it "Louder" is probably the best word Astronomers speak of a binary neutron star merger as a " standard siren tab The SNR is computed in relation to the small random background fluctuations not in relation to the DC light level Also ever present stationary noise a lot of it esp at low frequencies but also at a number of fixed higher frequencies is removed before considering the random background and computing SNRs Here's a plot of yesterday's stationary background noise levels from the detector status summary page for the day tab !

Indeed this was a completely new kind of glitch tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk first noted from LIGO Hanford on The cause remains unkown In late April another series of similar looking glitches happened again at Hanford during a couple of days And then from until we got a few hundred somewhat similar glitches from Livingston two of which are among your similarity search results In that case the cause is known it turned out tab Glitches from all three of these episodes have attracted a mix of low Q and high Q renderings so they differ widely in appearance If you want to see for yourself how a Blip changes in appearance under different rendering choices let's take one from O where the precise event timestamps and raw data have been published by now Head to the glitch plotter tab The same can be done with a published Binary Black Hole BBH chirp from O say GW tab Per the current version of the LIGO Data Management Plan tab way https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426474/ Yes the top of one arch just barely peeping over the bottom edge and then the top of a lesser parallel arch just above the dark Hz stationary noise band https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426516/ Because each of these baby Koi glitches is a very close overlapping double two humps at the top end and often a few dark holes down the middle where the two short duration things partially cancel https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426519/ Not too fuzzy just Scattered Light rendered at Q in between wheatgrass and scattering comb shapes https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ It hard working out which is which! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ I find it very difficult to make out Easily missed! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426516/ Be assured that you're miles ahead of the ML in this regard https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ ! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ I ve updated the GitHub PR to explain how a SameSite cookie protects against accidentally loading the wrong workflow when following a link from an email or external site https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ As a matter of interest maybe to others like myself what on earth is ConvNN?

We are having a talk about AI in our village hall next month so I thought I would try and get my head around it Sorry I should have started a new chat conversation https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ Among the various O "NotNoGlitch" subjects a few hundred mostly from Hanford O4b stand out They have peak frequencies near or near Hz and are readily tied to logbook entries about rung up violin modes The Machine Learning has been calling them No Glitch and indeed there's nothing much to see yet Omicron had triggered on them as excess noise with SNRs above or else they wouldn't exist as Gravity Spy subjects But it turns out that they don't actually represent glitches in the strain channel They represent elevated stationary noise levels in DARM and strain varying only gradually on time scales of minutes to hours They really originate as glitches in the glitch detection itself Thus I'm documenting them here as a distinct subclass of Violin Mode Harmonics Proposed Name LIGO O Invisible Violins ID of proposer Date of proposal Reference subjects for Classifier and Field Guide S holotype linked above S S S ! frame showing the second frames Short description Nothing at all stands out visually Minor unrelated noise may be present The peak frequencies accessible through Similarity Search tab Characteristics As above SNRs rarely exceed All Q value choices can occur Overlapping pairs of subjects are unusually common see below Hash tags a Collections NB the metadata links do not work at present pending a DYCWMI tool bugfix but will work once the tool has been fixed no training set at this time since the current Machine Learning doesn't take Omicron metadata into account Bulk collections growing H ER O4a Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h er a invisible violins link to its metadata tab L ER O4a Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant l er a invisible violins link to its metadata tab H ER O4b Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h er b invisible violins link to its metadata tab L ER O4b Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant l er b invisible violins link to its metadata tab Collaborators Remarks In fact not only is there an unusual excess of overlapping pairs of subjects these pairs also straddle full second boundaries at one minute intervals The examples from all come just before or just after a GPS second that fell seconds after a multiple of Those from all happened seconds after a multiple of On the other hand the seconds periodicity tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk of the Pizzicato glitches from O has disappeared completely Example pairs more will keep turning up from between and UTC tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab and from between and UTC tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab What must have been happening here is that Omicron in the presence of a rung up violin mode or other loud stationary narrowband noise tends to trigger near the end of its current seconds chunk of data and then again near the beginning of the next seconds chunk Sometimes only one member of such a pair of triggers will exceed the SNR > threshold for creating a Gravity Spy subject Sometimes both would remain too faint to show up here https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ So what to do about these triggers? Are they useful? Are they necessary? Could we do without them? The observatory operators and the data quality team on their weekly shifts don't need them rung up violin modes are reported in other more direct ways They do add some spice to the Gravity Spy volunteer experience One more sort of thing that requires taking a closer look and extracting the peak frequency using the Similarity Search tool tab It is likely that they could be avoided by padding the minute long data chunks on which Omicron operates with shoulders of at least seconds on both sides my experience whilst working with the glitch plotter tab So it may be better to keep things as they are and live with these "glitches" It's worth noting that the Virgo team had encountered a very similar issue at the beginning of O tab O https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ For the record below I am listing documented episodes of rung up violin modes from which we've seen visible or invisible fallout as Gravity Spy subjects ER LHO LHO tab O4a LHO 04ff LHO tab LLO briefly very visible just before a lockloss see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk LHO and following ITMY mode and later Hz with a series of logbook entries including LHO tab LHO LHO tab LHO 28ff LHO tab LLO 28f LLO tab LHO LHO tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ ER none O4b LLO 15f LLO tab LHO LHO tab LHO LHO tab I have not yet seen any subjects from subequent episodes LHO LHO tab LLO LLO tab LLO 16ff LLO tab LLO 31ff LLO tab LLO LLO tab modes https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ The images fed to the GravitySpy ML ConvNN day in day out while the observatories are Observing are the same that then get uploaded to Zooniverse as subjects for us to inspect except that the ML gets to "view" all four frames at once side by side and without the title texts colourmap axis tick marks and labels only the four spectrogram images themselves For re training purposes it would be fed a set of around a hundred such images carefully selected and believed to be representative of a single new glitch class In reality it's somewhat more complicated The set is split up randomly into a larger part used for the training phase and a smaller part for testing validation Then the current training subset is run through the neural network adjusting the cell connections in the process and the outcome is evaluated on the current test subset while keeping the connections fixed And then this is repeated with a new random splitting of the given subject set many times until the results no longer improve in further iterations The sort of language oriented AI that has been getting headlines in the last year and a half ChatGPT and friends works completely differently though The only commonalities are that they also run on computers and also need to be trained But they require vastly larger amounts of training data and existing Large Language Models have been trained on data of sometimes extremely dubious quality not to mention copyright infringements on a global scale https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ No doubt people will want to know about ChatGPT I have never used it but have actually heard about it for your explanations https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ Lockloss https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428724/ School of koi https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428725/ Fuzzy range?

The title subject is a rare Q rendering of a flock as is The remainder of the sim search results is something of a mixed bunch Since the choice of Q value has such a large effect on the general texture of the resulting subject images the Similarity Search tool tends to be more sensitive to the Q value than to the glitch class And since flocks at Q are rare it returns an eclectic mix of other things instead Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Whether you're browsing recent pages or viewing the results of a logbook search is specific to your current browser session and can't be exported through a URL The link you see in the URL field of your browser when you're looking at the search results ends up pointing at the logbook start page for everyone else No loss in the present case since flocks aren't momentous enough as glitches go to earn specific logbook mentions Only individual logbook entries and comments on them can be linked to directly Their URLs can be captured for pasting by using the browser's "Copy link" function on the "Link" button in the entry heading https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ for the feedback and information An eclectic mix indeed as sim search sees it I took a look at the array of subjects tagged with "flock" there is a wide variety of glitches making up a flock seems pretty special > Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Yes I recalled something about this from previous logbook searches seeing that my draft post returned the Home page after having pasted the URL on top of the search results even though that search URL contained the corresponding "page 1" and "page 2" appended yet switched to the Home page when pasted into the address bar Many thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ ! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ The center object looks a bit odd https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ What is the top glitch? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ I just got promoted from gravity spy level to gravity spy level So manually promoting may have fixed it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I would be very grateful if I could be manually promoted to Level Four as I have been on Level Three for sometime and yet Level Four is still locked Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi Brian While this is a very old glitch from I'd say that it looks like Blip ssp trumpetfish proposed This dated glitch brings back the sim search problem of duplicates where after a recent fix in this regard it no longer runs on older subjects having multiple identical copies returning the message " Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site " Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Is this scattered light ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Ah so the same glitch is still out there just with a different ID? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Tiny dot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ Hi for your interest If I understood correctly your question each subject has a unique subject id and then a random subject number assigned across all Zooniverse subjects As of this seeming Trumpetfish there are many subjects that fit the subclass definition each having a different subject id Yes Trumpetfish seems to be still around to date as is the case with many other classes and subclasses Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ The glitches visible in the strain channel are classic multi arch Scattered Light the kind that was still common during most of the third observing run before it got fixed in January The auxiliary channel which monitors the light circulating in the X arm represented by the few parts per million of it which make it through the mirror coatings on the end test mass and then get captured by the optics of the transmission monitoring system didn't witness it on this occasion The present S is a counterpart to S https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ Nice catch! This and similar subjects mostly from Hanford with brief sometimes repeating noise near and or around Hz are None Of The Above Sometimes we call them "Pirate Ships" by a superficial analogy with the old Virgo O glitch class of that name At Hanford they are caused by beam jitter they show up when the laser beam already wobbles sideways a little at the point where it enters the first vacuum chamber The subset near Hz got almost completely fixed in October the others still occur occasionally They are relatively rare They may yet earn a formal glitch class proposal once we've collected enough examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Another kind of None Of The Above These require a glance at the Similarity Search tool tab ended https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ To clarify this is primarily a gold standard example of Repeating Blips intended to familiarize volunteers in the level workflow with cases where groups of individual glitchlets need to be treated as a whole and where it is essential to look at the fourth frame and take in the whole picture And I agree on the central constituent blip being slightly mis shapen because it is coincidentally blended with a bit of unrelated lower frequency noise In some cases ancient subjects that had already been uploaded once before the Gravity Spy tools existed to serve as gold standard examples were uploaded a second time later as ordinary subjects with new subject numbers and were then also added to the Similarity Search tool's database Thus Sim Search won't find the present subject under its original number but a search for the character subject id uniqueid IdrpGAG37s will succeed and will find the copy with subject number Note that the image was reprocessed for this purpose In the newer copy the image title mentions the first observing run O explicitly https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ for the clarification Indeed it is important to look at the four frames and I had done so as usual just overlooked mentioning it I had seen the repeating glitches found them to be too unclear to determine which type of Blip they are and then focused around https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ GS promotion uses a different system You need to classify in level of GS to get to level of GS so let me know if that happens or not https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I promoted you as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ for the promotion to Level I did classify on that level which did then allowed me to be promoted to do Level classifications again for all your help with this issue I really enjoy classifying the many new glitches! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Almost no background noise! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Got this error message while searching for glitches similar to the subject Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site I guess it may be related to several lockloss events happened during that day but the shape is quite weird and I cannot obtain any rather fine timestamp for this subject for further correlation to be honest I am not even sure with what can I correlate besides logbook and detector status page Anyway would be happy to know if it is normal to have some subject present on zooniverse website and missing somewhere else as well as get some tips on how to treat such examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Apologies for the invoncenience! Last year there were occasional hiccups with the subject upload process which resulted in repeated upload attempts and thus in accidental duplications and it has not been feasible to clean up completely afterwards The present glitch is one of that happened between and at Hanford cause unknown and not related to locklosses but nearly each of them was uploaded to Zooniverse five times under five different subject numbers without making it into the Gravity Spy tools before finally being successfully uploaded a sixth time The good and usable subjects from those days have numbers 9636xxxx the earlier 9287xxxx through 9343xxxx should be considered as extraneous duplicates If we were to remove them from Zooniverse now we would also orphan the associated Talk threads and produce inconsistencies in any collections containing them The usable version of the present subject is tab As to how to deal with the duplicates I would frown at them flag them as such by adding them to suitable marker collections and move on to the next subject There's also a small handful of subjects showing other kinds of glitches of which two or more copies exist in the Similarity Seach database and these can produce a different nondescript error when one asks for fewer results than the number of copies There used to be many more during O many subjects had been ingested four or five times and there was one that had got uploaded more than a thousand times those had been cleared out at one point leaving only one representative subject of each glitch Clearing out the few that exist at the present time would require a disproportionate amount of manual effort so we've left them alone https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ oki thanks for clarification! Recently I started getting glitches from this sequence one after another but was unable to find any info in Talk Btw how did you manage to find usable version of the subject in question? Definitely not by brute forcing subject IDs matching right? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Yes well observed you'll see this in a number of ancient subjects If I am not mistaken the reason is that back then well before my time the normalized noise energy was fed into the colormap as is whereas more recent subjects use the logarithm of the normalized energy which will show some finer glitch details as well as the random background more clearly Noise levels within a single subject image can vary by five orders of magnitude even after the removal of stationary noise "whitening" during preprocessing https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ One of our veteran volunteers who is currently taking a break from Zooniverse had collected almost all of these two hundred something Hz glitch subjects as they come up whilst classifying Once our systematic similarity searches across the good ones found no further examples it was a matter of looking at each of the good ones in turn find its exact copies in the twenty odd collection pages where twelve subject per page are displayed write down the relationships in an offline file and remove the copies from the bulk collection so this eyeball search became easier with each glitch that we had dealt with A few duplicates had been missed and only showed up later and these could be tied in by eyeballing the collection of good representatives which fits on pages https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Can someone shed some light on what to classify this one please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ I have seen quite a few of these "512" short lines How to classify please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ I see a few of these strong solid line at Classification same as ripple? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ I have not seen this type before Any thoughts? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/ So some of the fainter glitches g scratchy were just not visible back then? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Scattered light with somerhing faint above very faint blip maybe?

None Of The Above is always an option whenever something doesn't want to fit easily into the available classes And this is often the case at present During the fourth observing run that's now in progress after three years of upgrades tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2800503?comment the LIGO interferometers have been producing a glitch mix that's very different from anything we had seen before Some old glitch classes still occur in recognizable forms some still occur but look different some no longer occur and quite a few completely new things tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk have been coming up The present subject comes from a brief episode on tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk when one of Livingston's feedback control loops had failed and over the course of a mere three minutes the interferometer drifted so far from its working point that the lock was lost We already see multiple things going on at once here repeating blips violin mode harmonics a wandering line While it's not at all obvious it was one of the repeating blips that triggered this subject But None Of The Above is certainly appropriate too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ None Of The Above They were a completely new and unexpected thing tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk when they suddenly started happening in large numbers during three days in late May and early June https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ Well noted! Again I would recommend None Of The Above These Hz glitches were another new thing when they showed up on at Hanford and then stopped happening again at the end of the month Only such glitches seem to have been recorded too few to justify a formal glitch class proposal the cause remains a mystery Around that time there were hiccups with the uploading of subjects to the Gravity Spy tools tab The Ripples have not reoccurred in the 3rd and 4th observing runs but there are some lookalikes that have been confusing the Gravity Spy Machine Learning too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ Yet another type of None Of The Above! These mini jolts like the Hz glitches come from beam jitter when the laser beam wobbles sideways by a tiny amount already before it enters the first vacuum chamber On this particular occasion on technicians had been pulling fiber cables under the raised floors near the control room to connect a fire alarm panel The connection to these glitches was soon noted tab Why not start a collection of these? It will come in helpful There isn't a formal glitch class proposal for these jitter glitches yet but I guess there have been enough of them to justify one once we can support it with collections of representative subjects https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/ They would have been visible when they occurred on their own thanks to the energy normalization but not when anything louder was also present https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Well observed! Yes that's a blip up there and looking at the reported peak frequency of Hz it was what triggered this subject although the image rendering then paid more attention to the accompanying scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430538/ Not sure if I should post it here but I didn't find any other suitable board to post it in anyway For the past days since I switched to level I constantly get similar subjects Sometimes they go one after another sometimes zooniverse put 'golden' subjects between them but what I mostly get is either H O Hz transient lines which do not have a clickable classification for them but were described in details in this thread Example https imgur com a AGZbIwX https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3430635/ https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3430635/ No problem and glad to hear that it worked and you're enjoying it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ the true chirp !

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

Citizen scientists have observed that these glitches represent elevated stationary noise levels in DARM, appearing as glitches in the glitch detection itself rather than the strain channel. This class is described as having overlapping frequencies and being visually unremarkable, often blending with the background noise but detected due to their spectral characteristics.\n   - **URLs involved**: `/talk/328/3430821/`, `/talk/328/3430834/`, `/talk/762/3428271/`\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - Citizen scientists in Talk Dataset 2 express concerns about the classification of specific glitches which appear to be misclassified by automated systems or are ambiguous in their spectral signatures. For example, there are references to glitches being mislabeled by Machine Learning (ML) systems, such as Violin Mode Harmonics being incorrectly tagged as 'No Glitch'.\n   - **URLs involved**: `/talk/730/3398363/`, `/talk/328/3430133/`\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Science:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, citizen scientists exhibit a deeper inquiry into the characteristics and classifications of glitches. Questions arise about the specific appearance of glitches under different rendering settings and Q values, indicating a quest to understand how data processing affects glitch visualization.\n   - There’s also a curiosity about how existing glitches could be related to new or unidentified classes, reflecting a growing sophistication in their understanding and categorization of glitches.\n   - **URLs involved**: `/talk/328/3430118/`, `/talk/328/3430142/`, `/talk/328/3430133/`\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins:**\n   - Several hypotheses are proposed in Talk Dataset 2 regarding the origins of glitches. For example, there’s a discussion on how 'Invisible Violins' might be caused by specific operational modes of sensors or certain types of environmental interference affecting the sensors.\n   - Discussions also include the impact of external seismic events on sensors, hypothesizing that these could be the triggering factors for certain types of glitches observed.\n   - **URLs involved**: `/talk/328/3430821/`, `/talk/328/3430834/`, `/talk/762/3428271/`\n\n5. **Questions Related to Sensors or Channels:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are discussions about the sensitivity of specific LIGO channels to certain types of glitches, implying a growing understanding of the relationship between sensor/channel characteristics and glitch appearances.\n   - Questions are raised about whether certain glitches like 'Invisible Violins' could be better detected or analyzed through specific channels or adjustments in the sensor settings, indicating a nuanced consideration of sensor capabilities and limitations.\n   - **URLs involved**: `/talk/328/3430821/`, `/talk/328/3430834/`", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1725753837, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_6f7679d977', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=626, prompt_tokens=22985, total_tokens=23611))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk Dataset 1:

This would be visible or absent when you click on Done Talk and scroll down a bit The ratio would allow an estimate how many such subjects there exist in total E if roughly every fifth is currently already in the collection then the total number should be around a thousand since I currently have circa and counting collected https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421500/ Sixty seven Nessie coil subjects as far as I've seen so far at most a few very faint ones might still be missing plus the onset tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421501/ I had assumed you needed more of them to be a flock https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421487/ I can try but have my family coming to stay this weekend https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421500/ Yes queried that a while ago I had thought flock was wrong for a fish School as opposed to shoal then Nothing wrong with being the Daily Pedant https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421485/ Yes can do now I have re read your post after the weekend https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421500/ Doesn't quite look like koi fish more like a very messy road type glitch coming off what might be a very loud or a forest https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422187/ In fact I only learned about the subtle shoal school of fish difference from the linked Wikipedia page after I had looked it up the first time in order to cite it in a Talk comment So it's a school when they're neatly "swimming in the same direction in a coordinated manner" As our Koi babies do in the present subject https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3421485/ Yes there's something Extremely Loud centered near the left edge of frame This event probably triggered a properly centered subject as well some seconds earlier than the present subject but I haven't seen it yet https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422187/ Similar to violin mode harmonic but not exactly it? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3121188/ Small sinusoidal wave cool! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Yes violin mode harmonics were one part of the story but there was much else going on during those minutes and the trigger for the present subject happened to be the fainter looking noise around Hz at time seconds So technically this would be more of a case of Repeating Blips but the whole combination is unsual enough that None Of The Above is perhaps the best choice If you're curious here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk is a longer illustrated explanation https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3121188/ this was unique event see A tale of two locklosses and other lists Subject sorry I posted this as duplicate https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3121188/ Pretty catch yes! What's less cool from a LIGO engineer's point of view is that this has been the most common type of glitch at Livingston since the beginning of the fourth observing run in May and it is still not clear how exactly these glitches arise We no longer get the sort of multi arch Scattered Light that was common in past years and that's illustrated in the Field Guide that sort was root caused in late tab The two arches are separated by a darker band covering Hz punctuated by three evenly spaced streaks tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk that's a region where there's a lot of always present stationary background noise which gets suppressed before our images are created So it's a new variant of lower frequency Scattered Light but it's unclear where the scattering happens at the corner station or near one of the two test masses at the ends of the arms and it's unclear what the reflecting item is that's moving relative to the test masses https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Huh so if I understand it correctly something is moving which causes the laser to move slightly thus registering as a "quake" I don't know the appropiate terminolgy sorry and you don't yet know what exactly is moving? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Rapid cycling glitches with the tips being the loudest almost flame like with a very quiet baseline maybe suppressed in this resolution? between about and 72Hz and the tips between about and 400Hz with a frequency of about 125s between peaks https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422780/ A pair of koi fish with the heads centered at about and 0s and a blip centered at about 8s https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422784/ Whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/157809/ Lfb https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423032/ Background noise much more vibrant in this one! Something weird happened here https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Yes! We're living on a restless planet Even aside from earthquakes strong enough to be felt the ground beneath our feet is always in motion at speeds of up to about a micrometer per second caused by a mix of weak distant earthquakes wind driven ocean wave activity human activity plus gusts of wind leaning on building walls which then lean on the pillars which support them which then causes the floor under the pillars to tilt a little LIGO's vacuum chambers and the beam tubes connecting them along with anything attached to the walls of the vacuum vessels follow these ground motions Inside four of the large vacuum chambers at each site there are the test masses in their four stage "quad" pendulum suspensions mounted on a three stage internal seismic isolation structure mounted in turn on a hydraulic external pre isolation For some pictures of the hardware see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk So the test masses move a whole lot less than everything around them Between the polished mirror coated front surfaces of the test masses in each arm the main laser beams are circulating Tiny imperfections of the coatings cause a tiny fraction of the laser light to be scattered out of the beams in arbitrary directions Most of the stray light hits one of many baffles and is absorbed A tiny fraction of the stray light however may hit something reflective attached to the walls which are moving relative to the test masses A tiny fraction of the reflected light may hit the nearest test mass again and get scattered back to interfere with the main beam This fraction is what ultimately shows up as glitches If the stray light path length was constant it wouldn't be a problem the backscattered light may be out of phase with the main beam but that's no different from one test mass being a tiny wee little bit in the wrong place which would be automatically corrected But since the reflecting item would be moving relative to the test mass the stray light path length will also change and the phase relationship between the backscattered light and the main beam will change If the stray light path length changes by say s which is approximately laser wavelengths per second we'll get visible noise at about Hz Moreover multiple reflections can cause the stray light path to be traversed multiple times and then we'll also get visible noise at higher frequencies stacks of parallel arches The top of an arch always corresponds to the moment when the reflecting item was moving fastest in one direction or the other relative to the test mass At moments when the motion stops and turns around the arches descend off the bottom of our images The hunt for the causes involves careful analysis of videos of the near infrared light and actively shaking the beam tubes and measuring the effects both with accelerometers mounted on the beam tubes and chambers and in the light that ultimately reaches the detection photodiodes One recent logbook entry among many is LLO tab LIGO Livingston's X end test mass in its suspension center seen from rear left to its right is the suspended reaction mass with circular electrostatic actuator traces plated on it the angular structure on the left is the Arm Cavity Baffle All of the illumination captured here by the camera comes from stray laser light ! LLO ETMX quad Those gold plated electrostatic traces used to be the reflecting item responsible for the classic multi arch Scattered Light glitches during past observing runs This has been addressed since January by more carefully steering the suspensions to keep the distance between each test mass and the reaction mass behind it very nearly constant Any remaining glitches from this path would now occur below Hz where we won't see them in our subject images Looking a little further to the left with the test mass out of view beyond the right edge we now have the Arm Cavity Baffle on the right the cryopump baffle with two glints on its right edge left of center and a on the left a rather bright double glint off a spool piece where there's a large gate valve in the X arm beam tube The corner station would be km further away at rear left ! LLO glints near the end of the X arm Images from the LIGO logbooks courtesy Caltech MIT LIGO Laboratory tab The cryopump baffle is unlikely to be "it" they used to vibrate quite a lot in the presence of elevated ground motion levels and they were responsible for a lot of glitches during O but steps have since been taken to prevent them from vibrating The spool piece might be "it" but this has neither been proven nor ruled out yet The changes in the light path length implied by the frequencies of our arches seem a bit too large for it the spool piece shouldn't be able to move that much Hope this helps a little! By the way note that we don't see the main beam in these images There are more than kW of laser light circulating along earch arm between the reflecting surfaces of the input and end test masses but everything is happening inside a hard vacuum Thus there are next to no air molecules anywhere between the test masses that would scatter some light out of the beam towards the camera as they would if the beam was travelling in air https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ This is a rather common form that Scattered Light glitches from Hanford have been taking during the ongoing fourth observing run No well formed arches just wavy more or less parallel bits and fragments at frequencies mostly between and Hz sometimes with additional pieces between and Hz The band between and Hz tends to appear dark in most of our images It is blanketed by loud stationary noise which gets suppressed before our spectrogram images are created Only the loudest glitches manage to exceed the background noise in this band and show up there as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Very cool! So a lot of parts reflect just not into the recieving sensor? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Yes a lot of things inside the vacuum vessels are shiny and reflective One can't simply paint everything flat black paints don't go well with vacuum Paint molecules would evaporate drift around and settle somewhere else even on the test masses where we absolutely don't want them The baffles get special coatings of non smooth light absorbing materials and even then their edges can still reflect some light But the total area of the large vacuum chambers and long beam tubes is just too much to treat it all in this way That said the mirrors which are meant to reflect light in the intended directions are of exceedingly high quality and almost all of the light does go where it is meant to go The coatings on the end test masses reflect more than of the laser light! And the few parts per million that get through these coatings aren't wasted They are captured by additional optics behind the test masses and are used to measure the circulating light power and the beam position and angle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Very cool! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Baby koi school https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423913/ School of melted blips https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423915/ Scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423919/ School koi plus ?

One possibility I've been mulling over and which may turn out to be wrong is that Cairns might be another part of the same population as Vibration Eruptions tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 1009409?comment where in the latter case the reflecting item the cryopump baffles used to be the prime suspect would be vibrating with larger amplitude thus upconverting the noise to higher frequencies at the culmination and as a byproduct also raising the decay phase which lasts a few seconds to frequencies above Hz where it doesn't get completely drowned out by the stationary background noise Like Cairns Vibration Eruptions attract renderings at a variety of Q values and they are roughly equally rare In this light it is interesting that you've picked up three in between subjects that I would be inclined to file under Vibration Eruption ! frame and tab which has just brought up in Talk may be yet another in between case It would be interesting to learn what the PEM beamtube accelerometer aux channels have to say about all these glitches especially those near the four cryopumps at each site By the way last week I had added another O3b example with renderings at all four Q values of a plausible Cairn to an earlier entry on the first page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3399349?comment of this present thread https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Noting in passing that there are other ongoing mislabeling issues on an even larger scale Hundreds of O4b glitches caused by rung up Violin Mode Harmonics have been getting mis labeled as No Glitch by the ML and have been placed into entry level workflows where they'll get mis classified as such by new volunteers too And lots of higher Q renderings of glitches peaking near Hz from Livingston " Hz monster" fuzzy range week tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3314162?comment to have been mis labeled as Power Line and have likewise wound up in the entry level workflows https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ for the feedback and explanations Interesting to see for how many years Vibration Eruptions have lived through If I picked three subjects that may fit this other class there is always a possibility that one belongs to the other Regarding the Vibration proposal > Shorter duration version lasts almost sec but it is usually longer sec long vibration glitch is not unusual Duration above would not fit Cairn O preliminary characteristics Subspecies perhaps?

There's this thing about looking at the strain channel and an auxiliary channel side by side known as "Gravity Spy 0" > All those mis labelling at a larger scale Well I can't blame the old ML for not knowing what to do with a genuinely new kind of glitch but it needs to be watched by human eyes and should not be blindly trusted to feed Gravity Spy on Zooniverse with a decent distribution of easy and less easy subjects For that matter I myself shouldn't be blindly trusted by anyone either!

If so would it be possible to view an image of the entire whistle? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Is this no glitch ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ there is something ? here very faint though https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424994/ I've seen a few of these "christmas trees" what causes them? also do these sometimes cause lock loss because of how loud they are? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ multiple short sinusoidal waves in the 512HZ range most noticably between 5s and 2s Are these waves caused by the automated control loops? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3064584/ Well observed! This is a good question and I don't know the answer After one of the hundreds of feedback control loops that normally cooperate to maintain a good lock had failed outright when one camera monitoring the beam alignment had stopped working there were multiple unusual things going on at once By the time the present subject was recorded a couple minutes later the Livingston interferometer had already drifted so far from its intended working point that a lockloss was less than seconds away Bits and pieces of this wandering line are visible in a number of subjects from the surrounding minutes tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk I haven't seen anything similar to it in any Livingston O subjects recorded in more normal conditions Do watch out though for a Wandering Line undulating more slowly in a few dozen Hanford O subjects from last January https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3064584/ Yes to fixes applied a few years ago most of it nowadays happens below the Hz bottom edge of our spectrograms we only get to see the topmost parts of the action https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ NOTA is fine when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes This subject shows a coincidental mix of two different independent glitches The tall central feature with hints of "lighthouse" decorations could be called a Blip although it's a bit of a stretch if it had been louder it would turn into a kind of Extremely Loud The "wheatgrass" surrounding it below Hz is a form of Scattered Light rendered as rows of beatnote pulses here because this subject was processed with very fine time resolution at the expense of very coarse frequency resolution The "fins" of a Koi Fish would look somewhat similar but more symmetric and at slightly higher frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ The raw data are recorded at a rate of samples per second so frequencies up to Hz could be extracted with some distortion and up to a little beyond Hz in sufficient quality to create images like ours this isn't normally done here since it costs extra memory and processing time and most glitches don't need it I don't have a timestamp for the present subject so I can't produce another image of this particular Whistle even though the raw data from the first three observing runs are public by now but see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2079928?comment page for some other examples and illustrations! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Another great question! Some old examples aside it is safe to assume that every Gravity Spy subject from recent and ongoing observing runs contains a glitch or rarely a real gravitational wave chirp something that exceeded the ever present background noise levels by at least a factor of But that Something isn't always visible in the resulting image The Gravity Spy tools tab Watch out for other NotNoGlitch subjects There are many with reported peak frequencies around or around Hz betraying a violin mode origin quite a few from Hanford at or Hz which tend to belong into a proposed new class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk some from Hanford at or Hz and more from Livingston at Hz which belong into another propopsed class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and some others https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ What happens when a participant chooses NOTA? Does it get sent to a higher level for further inspection? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ I just checked the datasets at gwosc to see if I could get the data from there but it looks like data from January to November is missing entirely? Why is this? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ First of all This is an extraneous subject there must exist another where the obvious extremely loud glitch appears properly centered I haven't seen it yet but it would probably look somewhat like tab recorded a day and a half earlier The difference in appearance is due to rendering choices coarse vs fine time resolution combined with fine vs coarse frequency resolution Why do we get such extraneous off center subjects? Mostly because the glitch detection software inspects minute long chunks of data at a time setting to work in near real time whenever another minute's worth of data has become available The "outskirts" of a loud glitch near the end of one chunk can then cause another spurious detection at the beginning of the next chunk as in this case or the onset of a loud glitch near the beginning of a fresh chunk can already have caused a spurious detection at the end of the preceding chunk Next This one did not cause a lockloss we see clean data with just the usual amount of faint random background noise everywhere in the right half of the fourth frame But similar glitches are among the loudest that a LIGO interferometer can with luck survive without losing its lock tab is one of the loudest such I've seen at an SNR above And even louder ones can cause a lockloss E this one did some seconds beyond the " s" right edge of the fourth frame ! frame What causes this kind of extremely loud glitches? Ultimately earthquakes or thunderclaps or very strong gusts of wind which despite the multi stage seismic isolation manage to cause one or more of the mirror suspensions to shake The feedback control loops which keep the arm length difference "DARM" constant to within a picometer a millionth of a micrometer and those which keep the test masses mirrors at their proper angles to allow the laser light to bounce back and forth between them more than a hundred times operate in a mode with limited actuation strength and low noise once the lock has been acquired They can compensate and damp some amount of unwanted motion but not a lot When more force would be needed than is available things will momentarily depart from the proper working point resulting in a sudden LOT of noise in the data and a loudspeaker in the control room will automatically issue a verbal alert like "EX saturation!" to the operator With luck acting a little longer with the limited force available may still suffice to recover from the disturbance or it may not the lock may be lost a fast shutter closes within milliseconds to protect the detection photodiodes the input laser power is ramped down the remaining circulating laser light ends up in beam dumps and the lock would need to be reacquired slowly The saturation and lockloss illustrated above at 19T was caused by an earthquake and goes with LLO tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ In case of a no glitch should I use the tools to see if this is really the case and then report as NOTA if there is something? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ I'll have a look at the tools I assume these should only be used when the glitch class isn't clear? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ In the long run yes or it may just be kept around until all the newly discovered glitch classes have been studied sufficiently to re train the Machine Learning and to make some of them official so that further submissions can then mark them as "one of the above" And in any case NOTA ensures that more people are going to get a look! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Because the first Observing Run of Advanced LIGO ended on and the second started on GWOSC only holds published data tab Engineering Runs are thus excluded weekly maintenance periods are excluded routine half hour calibration measurement periods are excluded and of course there are no data from times when the observatories weren't observing g recovering from a lockloss or weren't even running because of lengthy upgrades tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2800503?comment between observing runs https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ You mention SNR what is this a measurement of? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Ah ok so gravity spy uses all data? this subject is from https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Ah ok how accurate has the algorithm gotten so far? Anywhere I can read up on this? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ It's up to you how deeply you want to delve into each subject! Sometimes Similarity Search provides insights that aren't easy to come by in other ways Personally I am going to some extremes but I certainly don't expect everybody else to do so I will run a "NotNoGlitch" subject through a similarity search for result immediately based on the character identifier which I can already access while classifying just to see whether it belongs under Violin Modes or Low Frequency Lines or somewhere else Otherwise I'll just make a note of the subject number to return to it later I would usually add a subject to an appropriate collection only after it has been returned as a result from a small similarity search starting from another subject by which time I would also have written down the peak frequency and other metadata and eyeballed an approximate timestamp to within minutes or so and then I feed the collected subject's number back into another sim search to keep my to do queues populated I also keep track of how often each subject has appeared as a sim search result In this way I can gradually build collections of the most representative subjects of each kind Cascades of many small searches asking for rather fewer than results each time tend to work much better for exploring an underlying populations than doing only a few searches asking for many results Of course the tool being image based mixes up all the NotNoGlitch subjects https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ Signal to background Noise Ratio or in this case glitch noise level divided by background noise level https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ The "date" stamps of old subjects are dummy values reflecting the date on which the upload script was last modified Only since the fourth observing run do we have the real event date available through the nfo button Admittedly this is a little confusing but then almost all old subjects have been deactivated from the workflows in order to focus on the new material except for the gold standard subjects and for a selection of Whistles from O to make up for a total lack of Whistles from O so far The present subject dates from the first observing run and was uploaded to Zooniverse in October after results from a pilot phase of the budding project had been evaluated Subjects from later runs have the run number embedded in their titles after the observatory name https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ To be frank at the moment the Machine Learning is all over the place The glitch mix coming from the LIGO observatories during the ongoing fourth observing run differs very much from anything we've seen before and from everything the ML had previously been trained for We still have recognizable Blips and Koi Fish but Scattered Light looks very different now and there are many completely new things tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and some new things that look deceptively similar to old glitch classes that haven't reoccurred in years or whose causes have been completely eliminated in the course of observatory upgrades And changing anything in the ML takes time tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3369772?comment One fairly recent paper is Y Wu al Advancing Glitch Classification in Gravity Spy Multi view Fusion with Attention based Machine Learning for Advanced LIGO's Fourth Observing Run tab You'll find this along with a selection of older material linked from Talk > Help > Resources tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk very much for your sustained interest! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ for the comprehensive answer! The tool seems complex but I'm sure I'll get used to it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ I've opened a PR to fix this by tracking your current workflow in a session cookie It might be a few months before it gets reviewed by Zooniverse though https github com zooniverse front end monorepo pull 6216 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ Jim! Just a question for my own understanding I'm aware that a fair amount of browser side Zooniverse state both PFE and FEM is cached in session storage Are cookies currently also being used for anything aside from authentication and statistics gathering? Or would this be the first use of cookies for maintaining functional state? Why I am asking is When a volunteer switches among several devices or among several different browsers browser profiles on one device session state for which the single source of truth is on the server side will be fetched and cached and the new session will be in sync with where the previous session had left off But cookies won't carry over This might cause surprises If there's already other functional state that's kept in cookies then I'd expect fewer surprises But if not then a solution based on the existing per user per project project preferences stored server side and cached browser side might be preferable in the long term so as to have all such features work in similar ways The server side project preferences already remember in which workflow of the project I've been active most recently and if I'm not mistaken they are already being fetched by both frontends when a classifier is launched so the information would be available to the frontends it's just not being used at the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ I'll have a look at the paper you sent very much for the quick and helpful answers! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Fair enough https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ So 95440075's glitch is times louder ? clearer? brighter? than the background? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Yes that's it "Louder" is probably the best word Astronomers speak of a binary neutron star merger as a " standard siren tab The SNR is computed in relation to the small random background fluctuations not in relation to the DC light level Also ever present stationary noise a lot of it esp at low frequencies but also at a number of fixed higher frequencies is removed before considering the random background and computing SNRs Here's a plot of yesterday's stationary background noise levels from the detector status summary page for the day tab !

Is it possible this subject may be a weird blip chirp shape due to a coarse time resolution?

Indeed this was a completely new kind of glitch tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk first noted from LIGO Hanford on The cause remains unkown In late April another series of similar looking glitches happened again at Hanford during a couple of days And then from until we got a few hundred somewhat similar glitches from Livingston two of which are among your similarity search results In that case the cause is known it turned out tab Glitches from all three of these episodes have attracted a mix of low Q and high Q renderings so they differ widely in appearance If you want to see for yourself how a Blip changes in appearance under different rendering choices let's take one from O where the precise event timestamps and raw data have been published by now Head to the glitch plotter tab The same can be done with a published Binary Black Hole BBH chirp from O say GW tab Per the current version of the LIGO Data Management Plan tab way https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426474/ Yes the top of one arch just barely peeping over the bottom edge and then the top of a lesser parallel arch just above the dark Hz stationary noise band https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426516/ Because each of these baby Koi glitches is a very close overlapping double two humps at the top end and often a few dark holes down the middle where the two short duration things partially cancel https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426519/ Not too fuzzy just Scattered Light rendered at Q in between wheatgrass and scattering comb shapes https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ It hard working out which is which! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ I find it very difficult to make out Easily missed! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426516/ Be assured that you're miles ahead of the ML in this regard https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ ! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ I ve updated the GitHub PR to explain how a SameSite cookie protects against accidentally loading the wrong workflow when following a link from an email or external site https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ As a matter of interest maybe to others like myself what on earth is ConvNN?

Or is it promotion to level that's not working? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Promotion to level is not working https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ A Convolutional Neural Network tab The simulated cells are arranged in layers The given image is divided into arrays of overlapping little squares The image data in each square are fed into one of the cells in the first layer Each of these input cells reacts to left right or up down or diagonal gradients brightness variations in its input square this is the "convolutional" part The outputs of the first layer cells in all sorts of combinations are processed further by the next layers Each successive layer is able to detect more complicated combinations of image traits straight or curved edges small or large uniform regions arches parallel streaks fuzziness Nessie coils After some four or five or six intermediate layers the final output layer consists of one cell for each glitch class or whatever one is trying to classify The one that "shouts most loudly" determines the label that will be attached to the image and how loudly it "shouts" compared to the others provides a confidence estimate During training the connections among the layers are strengthened or weakened at random until the outputs delivered on the training images agree reasonably well with the intended classifications This too aims to imitate how we understand learning to happen in real brains Hope this is suitably basic!

We are having a talk about AI in our village hall next month so I thought I would try and get my head around it Sorry I should have started a new chat conversation https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ Among the various O "NotNoGlitch" subjects a few hundred mostly from Hanford O4b stand out They have peak frequencies near or near Hz and are readily tied to logbook entries about rung up violin modes The Machine Learning has been calling them No Glitch and indeed there's nothing much to see yet Omicron had triggered on them as excess noise with SNRs above or else they wouldn't exist as Gravity Spy subjects But it turns out that they don't actually represent glitches in the strain channel They represent elevated stationary noise levels in DARM and strain varying only gradually on time scales of minutes to hours They really originate as glitches in the glitch detection itself Thus I'm documenting them here as a distinct subclass of Violin Mode Harmonics Proposed Name LIGO O Invisible Violins ID of proposer Date of proposal Reference subjects for Classifier and Field Guide S holotype linked above S S S ! frame showing the second frames Short description Nothing at all stands out visually Minor unrelated noise may be present The peak frequencies accessible through Similarity Search tab Characteristics As above SNRs rarely exceed All Q value choices can occur Overlapping pairs of subjects are unusually common see below Hash tags a Collections NB the metadata links do not work at present pending a DYCWMI tool bugfix but will work once the tool has been fixed no training set at this time since the current Machine Learning doesn't take Omicron metadata into account Bulk collections growing H ER O4a Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h er a invisible violins link to its metadata tab L ER O4a Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant l er a invisible violins link to its metadata tab H ER O4b Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h er b invisible violins link to its metadata tab L ER O4b Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant l er b invisible violins link to its metadata tab Collaborators Remarks In fact not only is there an unusual excess of overlapping pairs of subjects these pairs also straddle full second boundaries at one minute intervals The examples from all come just before or just after a GPS second that fell seconds after a multiple of Those from all happened seconds after a multiple of On the other hand the seconds periodicity tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk of the Pizzicato glitches from O has disappeared completely Example pairs more will keep turning up from between and UTC tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab and from between and UTC tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab What must have been happening here is that Omicron in the presence of a rung up violin mode or other loud stationary narrowband noise tends to trigger near the end of its current seconds chunk of data and then again near the beginning of the next seconds chunk Sometimes only one member of such a pair of triggers will exceed the SNR > threshold for creating a Gravity Spy subject Sometimes both would remain too faint to show up here https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ So what to do about these triggers? Are they useful? Are they necessary? Could we do without them? The observatory operators and the data quality team on their weekly shifts don't need them rung up violin modes are reported in other more direct ways They do add some spice to the Gravity Spy volunteer experience One more sort of thing that requires taking a closer look and extracting the peak frequency using the Similarity Search tool tab It is likely that they could be avoided by padding the minute long data chunks on which Omicron operates with shoulders of at least seconds on both sides my experience whilst working with the glitch plotter tab So it may be better to keep things as they are and live with these "glitches" It's worth noting that the Virgo team had encountered a very similar issue at the beginning of O tab O https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ For the record below I am listing documented episodes of rung up violin modes from which we've seen visible or invisible fallout as Gravity Spy subjects ER LHO LHO tab O4a LHO 04ff LHO tab LLO briefly very visible just before a lockloss see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk LHO and following ITMY mode and later Hz with a series of logbook entries including LHO tab LHO LHO tab LHO 28ff LHO tab LLO 28f LLO tab LHO LHO tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ ER none O4b LLO 15f LLO tab LHO LHO tab LHO LHO tab I have not yet seen any subjects from subequent episodes LHO LHO tab LLO LLO tab LLO 16ff LLO tab LLO 31ff LLO tab LLO LLO tab modes https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ The images fed to the GravitySpy ML ConvNN day in day out while the observatories are Observing are the same that then get uploaded to Zooniverse as subjects for us to inspect except that the ML gets to "view" all four frames at once side by side and without the title texts colourmap axis tick marks and labels only the four spectrogram images themselves For re training purposes it would be fed a set of around a hundred such images carefully selected and believed to be representative of a single new glitch class In reality it's somewhat more complicated The set is split up randomly into a larger part used for the training phase and a smaller part for testing validation Then the current training subset is run through the neural network adjusting the cell connections in the process and the outcome is evaluated on the current test subset while keeping the connections fixed And then this is repeated with a new random splitting of the given subject set many times until the results no longer improve in further iterations The sort of language oriented AI that has been getting headlines in the last year and a half ChatGPT and friends works completely differently though The only commonalities are that they also run on computers and also need to be trained But they require vastly larger amounts of training data and existing Large Language Models have been trained on data of sometimes extremely dubious quality not to mention copyright infringements on a global scale https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ No doubt people will want to know about ChatGPT I have never used it but have actually heard about it for your explanations https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ Lockloss https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428724/ School of koi https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428725/ Fuzzy range?

The title subject is a rare Q rendering of a flock as is The remainder of the sim search results is something of a mixed bunch Since the choice of Q value has such a large effect on the general texture of the resulting subject images the Similarity Search tool tends to be more sensitive to the Q value than to the glitch class And since flocks at Q are rare it returns an eclectic mix of other things instead Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Whether you're browsing recent pages or viewing the results of a logbook search is specific to your current browser session and can't be exported through a URL The link you see in the URL field of your browser when you're looking at the search results ends up pointing at the logbook start page for everyone else No loss in the present case since flocks aren't momentous enough as glitches go to earn specific logbook mentions Only individual logbook entries and comments on them can be linked to directly Their URLs can be captured for pasting by using the browser's "Copy link" function on the "Link" button in the entry heading https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ for the feedback and information An eclectic mix indeed as sim search sees it I took a look at the array of subjects tagged with "flock" there is a wide variety of glitches making up a flock seems pretty special > Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Yes I recalled something about this from previous logbook searches seeing that my draft post returned the Home page after having pasted the URL on top of the search results even though that search URL contained the corresponding "page 1" and "page 2" appended yet switched to the Home page when pasted into the address bar Many thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ ! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ The center object looks a bit odd https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ What is the top glitch? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ I just got promoted from gravity spy level to gravity spy level So manually promoting may have fixed it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I would be very grateful if I could be manually promoted to Level Four as I have been on Level Three for sometime and yet Level Four is still locked Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi Brian While this is a very old glitch from I'd say that it looks like Blip ssp trumpetfish proposed This dated glitch brings back the sim search problem of duplicates where after a recent fix in this regard it no longer runs on older subjects having multiple identical copies returning the message " Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site " Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Is this scattered light ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Ah so the same glitch is still out there just with a different ID? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Tiny dot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ Hi for your interest If I understood correctly your question each subject has a unique subject id and then a random subject number assigned across all Zooniverse subjects As of this seeming Trumpetfish there are many subjects that fit the subclass definition each having a different subject id Yes Trumpetfish seems to be still around to date as is the case with many other classes and subclasses Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ The glitches visible in the strain channel are classic multi arch Scattered Light the kind that was still common during most of the third observing run before it got fixed in January The auxiliary channel which monitors the light circulating in the X arm represented by the few parts per million of it which make it through the mirror coatings on the end test mass and then get captured by the optics of the transmission monitoring system didn't witness it on this occasion The present S is a counterpart to S https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ Nice catch! This and similar subjects mostly from Hanford with brief sometimes repeating noise near and or around Hz are None Of The Above Sometimes we call them "Pirate Ships" by a superficial analogy with the old Virgo O glitch class of that name At Hanford they are caused by beam jitter they show up when the laser beam already wobbles sideways a little at the point where it enters the first vacuum chamber The subset near Hz got almost completely fixed in October the others still occur occasionally They are relatively rare They may yet earn a formal glitch class proposal once we've collected enough examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Another kind of None Of The Above These require a glance at the Similarity Search tool tab ended https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ To clarify this is primarily a gold standard example of Repeating Blips intended to familiarize volunteers in the level workflow with cases where groups of individual glitchlets need to be treated as a whole and where it is essential to look at the fourth frame and take in the whole picture And I agree on the central constituent blip being slightly mis shapen because it is coincidentally blended with a bit of unrelated lower frequency noise In some cases ancient subjects that had already been uploaded once before the Gravity Spy tools existed to serve as gold standard examples were uploaded a second time later as ordinary subjects with new subject numbers and were then also added to the Similarity Search tool's database Thus Sim Search won't find the present subject under its original number but a search for the character subject id uniqueid IdrpGAG37s will succeed and will find the copy with subject number Note that the image was reprocessed for this purpose In the newer copy the image title mentions the first observing run O explicitly https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ for the clarification Indeed it is important to look at the four frames and I had done so as usual just overlooked mentioning it I had seen the repeating glitches found them to be too unclear to determine which type of Blip they are and then focused around https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ GS promotion uses a different system You need to classify in level of GS to get to level of GS so let me know if that happens or not https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I promoted you as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ for the promotion to Level I did classify on that level which did then allowed me to be promoted to do Level classifications again for all your help with this issue I really enjoy classifying the many new glitches! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Almost no background noise! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Got this error message while searching for glitches similar to the subject Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site I guess it may be related to several lockloss events happened during that day but the shape is quite weird and I cannot obtain any rather fine timestamp for this subject for further correlation to be honest I am not even sure with what can I correlate besides logbook and detector status page Anyway would be happy to know if it is normal to have some subject present on zooniverse website and missing somewhere else as well as get some tips on how to treat such examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Apologies for the invoncenience! Last year there were occasional hiccups with the subject upload process which resulted in repeated upload attempts and thus in accidental duplications and it has not been feasible to clean up completely afterwards The present glitch is one of that happened between and at Hanford cause unknown and not related to locklosses but nearly each of them was uploaded to Zooniverse five times under five different subject numbers without making it into the Gravity Spy tools before finally being successfully uploaded a sixth time The good and usable subjects from those days have numbers 9636xxxx the earlier 9287xxxx through 9343xxxx should be considered as extraneous duplicates If we were to remove them from Zooniverse now we would also orphan the associated Talk threads and produce inconsistencies in any collections containing them The usable version of the present subject is tab As to how to deal with the duplicates I would frown at them flag them as such by adding them to suitable marker collections and move on to the next subject There's also a small handful of subjects showing other kinds of glitches of which two or more copies exist in the Similarity Seach database and these can produce a different nondescript error when one asks for fewer results than the number of copies There used to be many more during O many subjects had been ingested four or five times and there was one that had got uploaded more than a thousand times those had been cleared out at one point leaving only one representative subject of each glitch Clearing out the few that exist at the present time would require a disproportionate amount of manual effort so we've left them alone https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ oki thanks for clarification! Recently I started getting glitches from this sequence one after another but was unable to find any info in Talk Btw how did you manage to find usable version of the subject in question? Definitely not by brute forcing subject IDs matching right? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Yes well observed you'll see this in a number of ancient subjects If I am not mistaken the reason is that back then well before my time the normalized noise energy was fed into the colormap as is whereas more recent subjects use the logarithm of the normalized energy which will show some finer glitch details as well as the random background more clearly Noise levels within a single subject image can vary by five orders of magnitude even after the removal of stationary noise "whitening" during preprocessing https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ One of our veteran volunteers who is currently taking a break from Zooniverse had collected almost all of these two hundred something Hz glitch subjects as they come up whilst classifying Once our systematic similarity searches across the good ones found no further examples it was a matter of looking at each of the good ones in turn find its exact copies in the twenty odd collection pages where twelve subject per page are displayed write down the relationships in an offline file and remove the copies from the bulk collection so this eyeball search became easier with each glitch that we had dealt with A few duplicates had been missed and only showed up later and these could be tied in by eyeballing the collection of good representatives which fits on pages https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Can someone shed some light on what to classify this one please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ I have seen quite a few of these "512" short lines How to classify please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ I see a few of these strong solid line at Classification same as ripple? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ I have not seen this type before Any thoughts? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/ So some of the fainter glitches g scratchy were just not visible back then? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Scattered light with somerhing faint above very faint blip maybe? I put this as NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430538/ Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and thank you for contributing! None Of The Above is always an option whenever something doesn't want to fit easily into the available classes And this is often the case at present During the fourth observing run that's now in progress after three years of upgrades tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2800503?comment the LIGO interferometers have been producing a glitch mix that's very different from anything we had seen before Some old glitch classes still occur in recognizable forms some still occur but look different some no longer occur and quite a few completely new things tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk have been coming up The present subject comes from a brief episode on tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk when one of Livingston's feedback control loops had failed and over the course of a mere three minutes the interferometer drifted so far from its working point that the lock was lost We already see multiple things going on at once here repeating blips violin mode harmonics a wandering line While it's not at all obvious it was one of the repeating blips that triggered this subject But None Of The Above is certainly appropriate too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ None Of The Above They were a completely new and unexpected thing tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk when they suddenly started happening in large numbers during three days in late May and early June https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ Well noted! Again I would recommend None Of The Above These Hz glitches were another new thing when they showed up on at Hanford and then stopped happening again at the end of the month Only such glitches seem to have been recorded too few to justify a formal glitch class proposal the cause remains a mystery Around that time there were hiccups with the uploading of subjects to the Gravity Spy tools tab The Ripples have not reoccurred in the 3rd and 4th observing runs but there are some lookalikes that have been confusing the Gravity Spy Machine Learning too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ Yet another type of None Of The Above! These mini jolts like the Hz glitches come from beam jitter when the laser beam wobbles sideways by a tiny amount already before it enters the first vacuum chamber On this particular occasion on technicians had been pulling fiber cables under the raised floors near the control room to connect a fire alarm panel The connection to these glitches was soon noted tab Why not start a collection of these? It will come in helpful There isn't a formal glitch class proposal for these jitter glitches yet but I guess there have been enough of them to justify one once we can support it with collections of representative subjects https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/ They would have been visible when they occurred on their own thanks to the energy normalization but not when anything louder was also present https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Well observed! Yes that's a blip up there and looking at the reported peak frequency of Hz it was what triggered this subject although the image rendering then paid more attention to the accompanying scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430538/ Not sure if I should post it here but I didn't find any other suitable board to post it in anyway For the past days since I switched to level I constantly get similar subjects Sometimes they go one after another sometimes zooniverse put 'golden' subjects between them but what I mostly get is either H O Hz transient lines which do not have a clickable classification for them but were described in details in this thread Example https imgur com a AGZbIwX https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3430635/ https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3430635/ No problem and glad to hear that it worked and you're enjoying it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ the true chirp !

    Below are a list of interests I would like an answer for. Please provide at least three bullet points, each with a couple of sentences responding to each interest. Also, importantly, if your answer uses a comment, after the end of each answer provide, provide a list of URL variables which played a part in your response.
    
    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-A5HEzsKFdA6pG53H59laGZ4cgseK6', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='1. **New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Invisible Violins**: A new glitch class named "Invisible Violins" is proposed in Talk Dataset 2. This class is identified as representing elevated stationary noise levels in the DARM and strain, which vary gradually over time and do not visually manifest as typical glitches. This discovery highlights a subtle form of noise that has been categorized due to its unique, non-visual characteristics. The proposal includes a detailed explanation of its occurrence and the conditions under which it is observed. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/)\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - Concerns in Talk Dataset 2 revolve around the misidentification or the difficulty in classifying certain glitches accurately. For example, participants discuss the challenges with "Violin Mode Harmonics" being mislabeled as "No Glitch" due to their subtle manifestations, which often do not appear prominently in the data presented. This indicates ongoing issues with the classification accuracy and the potential need for re-evaluating the training of machine learning models used for automated classification. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/)\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes, Sensors, or Gravitational Wave Science:**\n   - There is a noticeable inquiry into the impact of external environmental factors on the sensors, specifically how seismic activities might influence the readings. A question raised involves the speed of seismic waves and how these correlate with the timestamps of recorded glitches, reflecting a deeper dive into understanding the physical connections between terrestrial phenomena and sensor readings. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3426471/)\n   - Another emerging question is about the specific features of certain glitches, like the "Pirate Ship" glitches, which are attributed to beam jitter. Participants are curious about the engineering aspects of the sensors that could lead to such specific and rare glitch manifestations. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/)\n   - Technical discussions also extend to the machine learning aspects used in the classification processes. Volunteers are asking about the workings of convolutional neural networks (ConvNN) used in the project, indicating a growing interest in the intersection of AI technology and astrophysical data analysis. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/)\n\n4. **Hypotheses about Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - One hypothesis suggests that certain glitches, specifically the "Pirate Ships," may be caused by slight movements of the laser beam at its entry point into the vacuum chamber, possibly triggered by nearby physical activities such as cable pulling. This hypothesis is based on the observation of the correlation between such physical activities and the appearance of these glitches, offering a direct link between operational activities at observatory sites and data anomalies. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/)\n   - Another hypothesis involves "Invisible Violins," where the peculiar nature of these glitches suggests that they may be related to very subtle fluctuations in the strain channel, not immediately noticeable but detectable as anomalous noise patterns over time. This hypothesis is analytical as it tries to explain glitch occurrences not by their visible impact but through their underlying statistical properties. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/)\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there is a focused discussion on whether certain glitches like "Invisible Violins" could be better analyzed by adjusting the data chunks used in their detection. This involves technical suggestions on how data handling might be optimized to avoid misclassifications and improve the sensitivity of the detection algorithms to these subtle noise types. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/)\n   - Another discussion centers on the effectiveness of different sensors in capturing certain types of glitches, with specific reference to how auxiliary channels might be better utilized to capture and analyze glitches that are otherwise hard to classify. This reflects a nuanced approach to understanding the capabilities and limitations of the sensor array used in the LIGO projects.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    Consider Talk Dataset 1:
     Whistle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/157809/ Lfb https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423032/ Background noise much more vibrant in this one! Something weird happened here https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Yes! We're living on a restless planet Even aside from earthquakes strong enough to be felt the ground beneath our feet is always in motion at speeds of up to about a micrometer per second caused by a mix of weak distant earthquakes wind driven ocean wave activity human activity plus gusts of wind leaning on building walls which then lean on the pillars which support them which then causes the floor under the pillars to tilt a little LIGO's vacuum chambers and the beam tubes connecting them along with anything attached to the walls of the vacuum vessels follow these ground motions Inside four of the large vacuum chambers at each site there are the test masses in their four stage "quad" pendulum suspensions mounted on a three stage internal seismic isolation structure mounted in turn on a hydraulic external pre isolation For some pictures of the hardware see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk So the test masses move a whole lot less than everything around them Between the polished mirror coated front surfaces of the test masses in each arm the main laser beams are circulating Tiny imperfections of the coatings cause a tiny fraction of the laser light to be scattered out of the beams in arbitrary directions Most of the stray light hits one of many baffles and is absorbed A tiny fraction of the stray light however may hit something reflective attached to the walls which are moving relative to the test masses A tiny fraction of the reflected light may hit the nearest test mass again and get scattered back to interfere with the main beam This fraction is what ultimately shows up as glitches If the stray light path length was constant it wouldn't be a problem the backscattered light may be out of phase with the main beam but that's no different from one test mass being a tiny wee little bit in the wrong place which would be automatically corrected But since the reflecting item would be moving relative to the test mass the stray light path length will also change and the phase relationship between the backscattered light and the main beam will change If the stray light path length changes by say s which is approximately laser wavelengths per second we'll get visible noise at about Hz Moreover multiple reflections can cause the stray light path to be traversed multiple times and then we'll also get visible noise at higher frequencies stacks of parallel arches The top of an arch always corresponds to the moment when the reflecting item was moving fastest in one direction or the other relative to the test mass At moments when the motion stops and turns around the arches descend off the bottom of our images The hunt for the causes involves careful analysis of videos of the near infrared light and actively shaking the beam tubes and measuring the effects both with accelerometers mounted on the beam tubes and chambers and in the light that ultimately reaches the detection photodiodes One recent logbook entry among many is LLO tab LIGO Livingston's X end test mass in its suspension center seen from rear left to its right is the suspended reaction mass with circular electrostatic actuator traces plated on it the angular structure on the left is the Arm Cavity Baffle All of the illumination captured here by the camera comes from stray laser light ! LLO ETMX quad Those gold plated electrostatic traces used to be the reflecting item responsible for the classic multi arch Scattered Light glitches during past observing runs This has been addressed since January by more carefully steering the suspensions to keep the distance between each test mass and the reaction mass behind it very nearly constant Any remaining glitches from this path would now occur below Hz where we won't see them in our subject images Looking a little further to the left with the test mass out of view beyond the right edge we now have the Arm Cavity Baffle on the right the cryopump baffle with two glints on its right edge left of center and a on the left a rather bright double glint off a spool piece where there's a large gate valve in the X arm beam tube The corner station would be km further away at rear left ! LLO glints near the end of the X arm Images from the LIGO logbooks courtesy Caltech MIT LIGO Laboratory tab The cryopump baffle is unlikely to be "it" they used to vibrate quite a lot in the presence of elevated ground motion levels and they were responsible for a lot of glitches during O but steps have since been taken to prevent them from vibrating The spool piece might be "it" but this has neither been proven nor ruled out yet The changes in the light path length implied by the frequencies of our arches seem a bit too large for it the spool piece shouldn't be able to move that much Hope this helps a little! By the way note that we don't see the main beam in these images There are more than kW of laser light circulating along earch arm between the reflecting surfaces of the input and end test masses but everything is happening inside a hard vacuum Thus there are next to no air molecules anywhere between the test masses that would scatter some light out of the beam towards the camera as they would if the beam was travelling in air https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ This is a rather common form that Scattered Light glitches from Hanford have been taking during the ongoing fourth observing run No well formed arches just wavy more or less parallel bits and fragments at frequencies mostly between and Hz sometimes with additional pieces between and Hz The band between and Hz tends to appear dark in most of our images It is blanketed by loud stationary noise which gets suppressed before our spectrogram images are created Only the loudest glitches manage to exceed the background noise in this band and show up there as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423062/ Very cool! So a lot of parts reflect just not into the recieving sensor? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Yes a lot of things inside the vacuum vessels are shiny and reflective One can't simply paint everything flat black paints don't go well with vacuum Paint molecules would evaporate drift around and settle somewhere else even on the test masses where we absolutely don't want them The baffles get special coatings of non smooth light absorbing materials and even then their edges can still reflect some light But the total area of the large vacuum chambers and long beam tubes is just too much to treat it all in this way That said the mirrors which are meant to reflect light in the intended directions are of exceedingly high quality and almost all of the light does go where it is meant to go The coatings on the end test masses reflect more than of the laser light! And the few parts per million that get through these coatings aren't wasted They are captured by additional optics behind the test masses and are used to measure the circulating light power and the beam position and angle https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Very cool! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3422466/ Baby koi school https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423913/ School of melted blips https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423915/ Scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3423919/ School koi plus ?

One possibility I've been mulling over and which may turn out to be wrong is that Cairns might be another part of the same population as Vibration Eruptions tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 1009409?comment where in the latter case the reflecting item the cryopump baffles used to be the prime suspect would be vibrating with larger amplitude thus upconverting the noise to higher frequencies at the culmination and as a byproduct also raising the decay phase which lasts a few seconds to frequencies above Hz where it doesn't get completely drowned out by the stationary background noise Like Cairns Vibration Eruptions attract renderings at a variety of Q values and they are roughly equally rare In this light it is interesting that you've picked up three in between subjects that I would be inclined to file under Vibration Eruption ! frame and tab which has just brought up in Talk may be yet another in between case It would be interesting to learn what the PEM beamtube accelerometer aux channels have to say about all these glitches especially those near the four cryopumps at each site By the way last week I had added another O3b example with renderings at all four Q values of a plausible Cairn to an earlier entry on the first page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3399349?comment of this present thread https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Noting in passing that there are other ongoing mislabeling issues on an even larger scale Hundreds of O4b glitches caused by rung up Violin Mode Harmonics have been getting mis labeled as No Glitch by the ML and have been placed into entry level workflows where they'll get mis classified as such by new volunteers too And lots of higher Q renderings of glitches peaking near Hz from Livingston " Hz monster" fuzzy range week tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3314162?comment to have been mis labeled as Power Line and have likewise wound up in the entry level workflows https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ for the feedback and explanations Interesting to see for how many years Vibration Eruptions have lived through If I picked three subjects that may fit this other class there is always a possibility that one belongs to the other Regarding the Vibration proposal > Shorter duration version lasts almost sec but it is usually longer sec long vibration glitch is not unusual Duration above would not fit Cairn O preliminary characteristics Subspecies perhaps?

There's this thing about looking at the strain channel and an auxiliary channel side by side known as "Gravity Spy 0" > All those mis labelling at a larger scale Well I can't blame the old ML for not knowing what to do with a genuinely new kind of glitch but it needs to be watched by human eyes and should not be blindly trusted to feed Gravity Spy on Zooniverse with a decent distribution of easy and less easy subjects For that matter I myself shouldn't be blindly trusted by anyone either! I have neither the time nor the strength to keep looking at everything that needs to be looked at day in day out I keep making mistakes here and there like everyone for all my habitual sanity checking and proofreading before clicking the Submit button And there's too little double checking and critical feedback about my sometimes apodictic verdicts coming back to me https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ for the additional explanations Needless to say you keep doing an extraordinary job above and beyond on many fronts Regarding ML As seen from outside it seems that the vast amount of new glitch classes and newly found glitches known yet not proposed overwhelms the ML capacity and management to keep it updated improved even being more able to label correctly for example older glitches Regarding PEM > It would be interesting to learn what the PEM beamtube accelerometer aux channels have to say about all these glitches especially those near the four cryopumps at each site Right GS We would need to catch a pair of Livingston Main and PEM aux channels to pop up in the classifier related to the glitches being discussed to see what they say Then seeing and remembering that mainly only?

Good morning By looking again at the three Cairn glitches that I had collected of which you suspect above are Vibration Eruptions while sim search metadata is within what was defined earlier for Cairn I find them slightly different now in that the "mound" is broken or disheveled Most other Cairn form a more solid or structured full of bright energy mound Here is a look at page in my Cairn L collection turned all to frame Those suspected stand out now The pf is higher for these three subjects going from Hz through Hz while most of Cairn collected stay around Hz mainly the Hz range Perhaps this might be a hint? ! cairn vibration https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Excellent I fathom the huge job in building GS workflows and this proposed Cairn addition you mention would be fantastic if the team is able to do it Great explanations on this topic of PEM interest Many thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ It's intentional that the first two levels are traversed quickly and subsequent levels take longer not least because they need volunteer input and would be starved of input if people were advancing too quickly but submissions for which many thanks anyway! ought to be enough to unlock level Sanity check have you still been seeing occasional gold standard subjects e those which give feedback? If yes I would recommend you post a follow up in the other thread next door tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3398363?comment where the researchers are already watching Manually unlocking a level or three should not prevent further levels from being unlocked automatically once a number of gold standard submissions have been received which cover all classes for which such subjects exist https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ I have been seeing occasional gold standard subjects and usually I identify them correctly I'll try to reach subjects before responding to the thread you mentioned just to be sure https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Double tailed koifish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424977/ scattered light ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ I put this as none of the above however I think this might be koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Can the measuring equipment measure frequencies above 2048? If so would it be possible to view an image of the entire whistle? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Is this no glitch ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ there is something ? here very faint though https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424994/ I've seen a few of these "christmas trees" what causes them? also do these sometimes cause lock loss because of how loud they are? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ multiple short sinusoidal waves in the 512HZ range most noticably between 5s and 2s Are these waves caused by the automated control loops? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3064584/ Well observed! This is a good question and I don't know the answer After one of the hundreds of feedback control loops that normally cooperate to maintain a good lock had failed outright when one camera monitoring the beam alignment had stopped working there were multiple unusual things going on at once By the time the present subject was recorded a couple minutes later the Livingston interferometer had already drifted so far from its intended working point that a lockloss was less than seconds away Bits and pieces of this wandering line are visible in a number of subjects from the surrounding minutes tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk I haven't seen anything similar to it in any Livingston O subjects recorded in more normal conditions Do watch out though for a Wandering Line undulating more slowly in a few dozen Hanford O subjects from last January https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3064584/ Yes to fixes applied a few years ago most of it nowadays happens below the Hz bottom edge of our spectrograms we only get to see the topmost parts of the action https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ NOTA is fine when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes This subject shows a coincidental mix of two different independent glitches The tall central feature with hints of "lighthouse" decorations could be called a Blip although it's a bit of a stretch if it had been louder it would turn into a kind of Extremely Loud The "wheatgrass" surrounding it below Hz is a form of Scattered Light rendered as rows of beatnote pulses here because this subject was processed with very fine time resolution at the expense of very coarse frequency resolution The "fins" of a Koi Fish would look somewhat similar but more symmetric and at slightly higher frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ The raw data are recorded at a rate of samples per second so frequencies up to Hz could be extracted with some distortion and up to a little beyond Hz in sufficient quality to create images like ours this isn't normally done here since it costs extra memory and processing time and most glitches don't need it I don't have a timestamp for the present subject so I can't produce another image of this particular Whistle even though the raw data from the first three observing runs are public by now but see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2079928?comment page for some other examples and illustrations! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Another great question! Some old examples aside it is safe to assume that every Gravity Spy subject from recent and ongoing observing runs contains a glitch or rarely a real gravitational wave chirp something that exceeded the ever present background noise levels by at least a factor of But that Something isn't always visible in the resulting image The Gravity Spy tools tab Watch out for other NotNoGlitch subjects There are many with reported peak frequencies around or around Hz betraying a violin mode origin quite a few from Hanford at or Hz which tend to belong into a proposed new class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk some from Hanford at or Hz and more from Livingston at Hz which belong into another propopsed class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and some others https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ What happens when a participant chooses NOTA? Does it get sent to a higher level for further inspection? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ I just checked the datasets at gwosc to see if I could get the data from there but it looks like data from January to November is missing entirely? Why is this? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ First of all This is an extraneous subject there must exist another where the obvious extremely loud glitch appears properly centered I haven't seen it yet but it would probably look somewhat like tab recorded a day and a half earlier The difference in appearance is due to rendering choices coarse vs fine time resolution combined with fine vs coarse frequency resolution Why do we get such extraneous off center subjects? Mostly because the glitch detection software inspects minute long chunks of data at a time setting to work in near real time whenever another minute's worth of data has become available The "outskirts" of a loud glitch near the end of one chunk can then cause another spurious detection at the beginning of the next chunk as in this case or the onset of a loud glitch near the beginning of a fresh chunk can already have caused a spurious detection at the end of the preceding chunk Next This one did not cause a lockloss we see clean data with just the usual amount of faint random background noise everywhere in the right half of the fourth frame But similar glitches are among the loudest that a LIGO interferometer can with luck survive without losing its lock tab is one of the loudest such I've seen at an SNR above And even louder ones can cause a lockloss E this one did some seconds beyond the " s" right edge of the fourth frame ! frame What causes this kind of extremely loud glitches? Ultimately earthquakes or thunderclaps or very strong gusts of wind which despite the multi stage seismic isolation manage to cause one or more of the mirror suspensions to shake The feedback control loops which keep the arm length difference "DARM" constant to within a picometer a millionth of a micrometer and those which keep the test masses mirrors at their proper angles to allow the laser light to bounce back and forth between them more than a hundred times operate in a mode with limited actuation strength and low noise once the lock has been acquired They can compensate and damp some amount of unwanted motion but not a lot When more force would be needed than is available things will momentarily depart from the proper working point resulting in a sudden LOT of noise in the data and a loudspeaker in the control room will automatically issue a verbal alert like "EX saturation!" to the operator With luck acting a little longer with the limited force available may still suffice to recover from the disturbance or it may not the lock may be lost a fast shutter closes within milliseconds to protect the detection photodiodes the input laser power is ramped down the remaining circulating laser light ends up in beam dumps and the lock would need to be reacquired slowly The saturation and lockloss illustrated above at 19T was caused by an earthquake and goes with LLO tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ In case of a no glitch should I use the tools to see if this is really the case and then report as NOTA if there is something? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ I'll have a look at the tools I assume these should only be used when the glitch class isn't clear? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ In the long run yes or it may just be kept around until all the newly discovered glitch classes have been studied sufficiently to re train the Machine Learning and to make some of them official so that further submissions can then mark them as "one of the above" And in any case NOTA ensures that more people are going to get a look! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Because the first Observing Run of Advanced LIGO ended on and the second started on GWOSC only holds published data tab Engineering Runs are thus excluded weekly maintenance periods are excluded routine half hour calibration measurement periods are excluded and of course there are no data from times when the observatories weren't observing g recovering from a lockloss or weren't even running because of lengthy upgrades tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2800503?comment between observing runs https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ You mention SNR what is this a measurement of? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Ah ok so gravity spy uses all data? this subject is from https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Ah ok how accurate has the algorithm gotten so far? Anywhere I can read up on this? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ It's up to you how deeply you want to delve into each subject! Sometimes Similarity Search provides insights that aren't easy to come by in other ways Personally I am going to some extremes but I certainly don't expect everybody else to do so I will run a "NotNoGlitch" subject through a similarity search for result immediately based on the character identifier which I can already access while classifying just to see whether it belongs under Violin Modes or Low Frequency Lines or somewhere else Otherwise I'll just make a note of the subject number to return to it later I would usually add a subject to an appropriate collection only after it has been returned as a result from a small similarity search starting from another subject by which time I would also have written down the peak frequency and other metadata and eyeballed an approximate timestamp to within minutes or so and then I feed the collected subject's number back into another sim search to keep my to do queues populated I also keep track of how often each subject has appeared as a sim search result In this way I can gradually build collections of the most representative subjects of each kind Cascades of many small searches asking for rather fewer than results each time tend to work much better for exploring an underlying populations than doing only a few searches asking for many results Of course the tool being image based mixes up all the NotNoGlitch subjects https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ Signal to background Noise Ratio or in this case glitch noise level divided by background noise level https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ The "date" stamps of old subjects are dummy values reflecting the date on which the upload script was last modified Only since the fourth observing run do we have the real event date available through the nfo button Admittedly this is a little confusing but then almost all old subjects have been deactivated from the workflows in order to focus on the new material except for the gold standard subjects and for a selection of Whistles from O to make up for a total lack of Whistles from O so far The present subject dates from the first observing run and was uploaded to Zooniverse in October after results from a pilot phase of the budding project had been evaluated Subjects from later runs have the run number embedded in their titles after the observatory name https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ To be frank at the moment the Machine Learning is all over the place The glitch mix coming from the LIGO observatories during the ongoing fourth observing run differs very much from anything we've seen before and from everything the ML had previously been trained for We still have recognizable Blips and Koi Fish but Scattered Light looks very different now and there are many completely new things tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and some new things that look deceptively similar to old glitch classes that haven't reoccurred in years or whose causes have been completely eliminated in the course of observatory upgrades And changing anything in the ML takes time tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3369772?comment One fairly recent paper is Y Wu al Advancing Glitch Classification in Gravity Spy Multi view Fusion with Attention based Machine Learning for Advanced LIGO's Fourth Observing Run tab You'll find this along with a selection of older material linked from Talk > Help > Resources tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk very much for your sustained interest! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ for the comprehensive answer! The tool seems complex but I'm sure I'll get used to it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ I've opened a PR to fix this by tracking your current workflow in a session cookie It might be a few months before it gets reviewed by Zooniverse though https github com zooniverse front end monorepo pull 6216 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ Jim! Just a question for my own understanding I'm aware that a fair amount of browser side Zooniverse state both PFE and FEM is cached in session storage Are cookies currently also being used for anything aside from authentication and statistics gathering? Or would this be the first use of cookies for maintaining functional state? Why I am asking is When a volunteer switches among several devices or among several different browsers browser profiles on one device session state for which the single source of truth is on the server side will be fetched and cached and the new session will be in sync with where the previous session had left off But cookies won't carry over This might cause surprises If there's already other functional state that's kept in cookies then I'd expect fewer surprises But if not then a solution based on the existing per user per project project preferences stored server side and cached browser side might be preferable in the long term so as to have all such features work in similar ways The server side project preferences already remember in which workflow of the project I've been active most recently and if I'm not mistaken they are already being fetched by both frontends when a classifier is launched so the information would be available to the frontends it's just not being used at the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ I'll have a look at the paper you sent very much for the quick and helpful answers! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Fair enough https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ So 95440075's glitch is times louder ? clearer? brighter? than the background? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Yes that's it "Louder" is probably the best word Astronomers speak of a binary neutron star merger as a " standard siren tab The SNR is computed in relation to the small random background fluctuations not in relation to the DC light level Also ever present stationary noise a lot of it esp at low frequencies but also at a number of fixed higher frequencies is removed before considering the random background and computing SNRs Here's a plot of yesterday's stationary background noise levels from the detector status summary page for the day tab ! IGWN sensitivity Some LIGO noise features you can find in there include suspension noise near and near and Hz a mostly subtracted out bunch of calibration lines around Hz the Hz mains frequency the violin modes of the beam splitter suspension near Hz and those of the test mass suspensions near Hz and multiples thereof Virgo's fundamental violin modes show up near Hz and multiples and Virgo's Hz mains subtraction has been doing a good job leaving only a modest peak in the violet curve The steep overall rise on the left is mostly due to a combination of seismic noise thermal noise radiation pressure noise on the test masses and residual motion of the suspensions The less steep rise on the right is shot noise from the detection photodiodes picking up the incoming light in discrete quanta already mitigated as far as possible by quantum squeezing tab https en wikipedia org wiki Squeezed states of light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ What causes 60hz glitches to appear even when mitigated? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ I put none of the above Might be blip though https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425677/ Since scattered light doesn't have arches as obvious as before shouldn't the examples in the glitch selection be updated? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ Tiny high frequency glitch https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425678/ That depends We've had a few genuine Power Line glitches from Livingston during O so far which tend to look like these with a characteristic pair of "eyes" and with varying amounts of spillover to other frequencies ! frame They are caused by some Hz alternating current circuit switching on and off or off and on faster than the line subtraction filtering can follow The ever present Hz noise will be momentarily overcompensated then undercompensated then overcompensated again The stationary Hz noise mostly couples through magnetic fields There's a number of voltage monitors current monitors and magnetometers deployed and for each of them the correlation to the differential arm length measurements is known and periodically re measured and used to calibrate the subtraction But any filtering or subtraction confined to a very narrow frequency band necessarily takes time to react to changing conditions And while the subtraction is good overall or else the Hz peak in the noise spectrum would be much higher! it isn't perfect the actual coupling sites aren't quite where the magnetometers are You might enjoy skimming the paper P Nguyen al Environmental Noise in Advanced LIGO Detectors tab But there are also other kinds of glitches at adjacent frequencies unrelated to the electricity mains and not covered by the Hz mitigation E The suspensions of some auxiliary optics have a "bounce mode" resonance near Hz which can show up tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk at multiples thereof including Hz ! frame Between and Livingston experienced a series of very varied glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3314162?comment that seriously impacted the sensitivity mostly with peak frequencies of Hz or multiples thereof Some of these could look deceptively like Hz "line" noise ! frame After a lot of noise hunting by the engineers the cause for these along a complicated coupling path turned out tab tightened https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Footnote Narrowband noise spectral lines are dealt with in different ways on different time scales The published data on GWOSC have been carefully cleaned offline over the course of months after the end of each observing run The near realtime data on which the plots on the status summary pages are based have undergone near realtime cleaning which since it needs to be fast and has to rely on estimates extrapolations of slowly changing parameters can't be quite as good The Omicron software looks for glitches in a raw data stream that hasn't yet been line cleaned Gravity Spy subject images are created from the same raw data after a preprocessing "whitening" step which somewhat imperfectly subdues any noise which looks stationary on timescales of around one minute So what we see in our subject images is based on a cruder form of line noise suppression than the data that are later uploaded to GWOSC https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Panoptes authentication uses a secure cookie That been true since the Panoptes API launched in Session cookies are used for some other bits of user personalisation like remembering whether you prefer a light or dark theme User preferences aren dated so I can see which workflow you last worked on but I don know if that was last week or last year That leads to bugs most notably a project team sends out an email with a link to their classify page previous volunteers follow the link and their preferences load a completed workflow This in turn leads to excess classifications on subjects that have already been completed https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ Ok thank you for the clarification! We'll see how this plays out then https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ One improvement that has been made in the new code is that you can link directly to specific workflows by workflow ID That a lot more reliable than trying to guess from user preferences eg https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy classify workflow 1610 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ At some point they will be once the detector engineers and the machine learning experts have reached a consensus about how best to address the needs At the present time it isn't even clear yet how best to carve up the glitches lately caused by scattered light into classes that are on the one hand amenable to classifying by their images limited to frequencies above Hz and to seconds' worth on the time axis and on the other hand make sense from an engineering perspective Considering the impact on clean observing time glitches which remain confined below Hz do less harm than glitches showing up at higher frequencies From this angle it might make sense to maintain the distinction between Scattered Light with arches visible above Hz and Low Frequency Burst without such even though the same causes are at work From a cause hunting angle lumping them together looks more attractive From a mitigation angle if something can be done to push the arches below Hz it would already be considered good progress and once again separate classes would help to measure the benefits And from an ML angle the current neural network is struggling to make sense of edge cases like tab or tab but also with obvious rows of arches la Livingston O ! frame Upgrading and retraining the ML would help along with selecting new sets of example illustrations and of gold standard subjects along the way but would make it hard to compare future ML and volunteer classifications to existing ML and volunteer classifications of older subjects unless all the older subjects are also reprocessed and the Detector Characterization team expends extra time to familiarize themselves with the revised results So there is no easy win We've learned many lessons over the years and there are certainly things we'd do differently if we were to start over from scratch including better ways to adapt to unforeseen changes in the glitch mix For the moment we'll have to live within the limitations of the existing ML design use our human eyes and brains trained by millions of years of evolution to recognize ripe fruit and tiger stripes behind the foliage build representative collections and keep working on gradually improving the whole affair And your input is much appreciated! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ So a very large part of the noise is being removed just not everything? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Yes much is removed but not everything and especially not everything in near real time https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Pretty severe scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425841/ Huh thus is wild indeed Nice catch!

Indeed this was a completely new kind of glitch tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk first noted from LIGO Hanford on The cause remains unkown In late April another series of similar looking glitches happened again at Hanford during a couple of days And then from until we got a few hundred somewhat similar glitches from Livingston two of which are among your similarity search results In that case the cause is known it turned out tab Glitches from all three of these episodes have attracted a mix of low Q and high Q renderings so they differ widely in appearance If you want to see for yourself how a Blip changes in appearance under different rendering choices let's take one from O where the precise event timestamps and raw data have been published by now Head to the glitch plotter tab The same can be done with a published Binary Black Hole BBH chirp from O say GW tab Per the current version of the LIGO Data Management Plan tab way https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426474/ Yes the top of one arch just barely peeping over the bottom edge and then the top of a lesser parallel arch just above the dark Hz stationary noise band https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426516/ Because each of these baby Koi glitches is a very close overlapping double two humps at the top end and often a few dark holes down the middle where the two short duration things partially cancel https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426519/ Not too fuzzy just Scattered Light rendered at Q in between wheatgrass and scattering comb shapes https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ It hard working out which is which! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ I find it very difficult to make out Easily missed! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426516/ Be assured that you're miles ahead of the ML in this regard https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ ! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ I ve updated the GitHub PR to explain how a SameSite cookie protects against accidentally loading the wrong workflow when following a link from an email or external site https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ As a matter of interest maybe to others like myself what on earth is ConvNN?

The title subject is a rare Q rendering of a flock as is The remainder of the sim search results is something of a mixed bunch Since the choice of Q value has such a large effect on the general texture of the resulting subject images the Similarity Search tool tends to be more sensitive to the Q value than to the glitch class And since flocks at Q are rare it returns an eclectic mix of other things instead Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Whether you're browsing recent pages or viewing the results of a logbook search is specific to your current browser session and can't be exported through a URL The link you see in the URL field of your browser when you're looking at the search results ends up pointing at the logbook start page for everyone else No loss in the present case since flocks aren't momentous enough as glitches go to earn specific logbook mentions Only individual logbook entries and comments on them can be linked to directly Their URLs can be captured for pasting by using the browser's "Copy link" function on the "Link" button in the entry heading https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ for the feedback and information An eclectic mix indeed as sim search sees it I took a look at the array of subjects tagged with "flock" there is a wide variety of glitches making up a flock seems pretty special > Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Yes I recalled something about this from previous logbook searches seeing that my draft post returned the Home page after having pasted the URL on top of the search results even though that search URL contained the corresponding "page 1" and "page 2" appended yet switched to the Home page when pasted into the address bar Many thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ ! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ The center object looks a bit odd https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ What is the top glitch? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ I just got promoted from gravity spy level to gravity spy level So manually promoting may have fixed it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I would be very grateful if I could be manually promoted to Level Four as I have been on Level Three for sometime and yet Level Four is still locked Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Hi Brian While this is a very old glitch from I'd say that it looks like Blip ssp trumpetfish proposed This dated glitch brings back the sim search problem of duplicates where after a recent fix in this regard it no longer runs on older subjects having multiple identical copies returning the message " Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site " Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Is this scattered light ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Ah so the same glitch is still out there just with a different ID? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ Tiny dot https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ Hi for your interest If I understood correctly your question each subject has a unique subject id and then a random subject number assigned across all Zooniverse subjects As of this seeming Trumpetfish there are many subjects that fit the subclass definition each having a different subject id Yes Trumpetfish seems to be still around to date as is the case with many other classes and subclasses Regards https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ The glitches visible in the strain channel are classic multi arch Scattered Light the kind that was still common during most of the third observing run before it got fixed in January The auxiliary channel which monitors the light circulating in the X arm represented by the few parts per million of it which make it through the mirror coatings on the end test mass and then get captured by the optics of the transmission monitoring system didn't witness it on this occasion The present S is a counterpart to S https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ Nice catch! This and similar subjects mostly from Hanford with brief sometimes repeating noise near and or around Hz are None Of The Above Sometimes we call them "Pirate Ships" by a superficial analogy with the old Virgo O glitch class of that name At Hanford they are caused by beam jitter they show up when the laser beam already wobbles sideways a little at the point where it enters the first vacuum chamber The subset near Hz got almost completely fixed in October the others still occur occasionally They are relatively rare They may yet earn a formal glitch class proposal once we've collected enough examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/ Another kind of None Of The Above These require a glance at the Similarity Search tool tab ended https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429187/ To clarify this is primarily a gold standard example of Repeating Blips intended to familiarize volunteers in the level workflow with cases where groups of individual glitchlets need to be treated as a whole and where it is essential to look at the fourth frame and take in the whole picture And I agree on the central constituent blip being slightly mis shapen because it is coincidentally blended with a bit of unrelated lower frequency noise In some cases ancient subjects that had already been uploaded once before the Gravity Spy tools existed to serve as gold standard examples were uploaded a second time later as ordinary subjects with new subject numbers and were then also added to the Similarity Search tool's database Thus Sim Search won't find the present subject under its original number but a search for the character subject id uniqueid IdrpGAG37s will succeed and will find the copy with subject number Note that the image was reprocessed for this purpose In the newer copy the image title mentions the first observing run O explicitly https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ for the clarification Indeed it is important to look at the four frames and I had done so as usual just overlooked mentioning it I had seen the repeating glitches found them to be too unclear to determine which type of Blip they are and then focused around https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ GS promotion uses a different system You need to classify in level of GS to get to level of GS so let me know if that happens or not https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ I promoted you as well https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ for the promotion to Level I did classify on that level which did then allowed me to be promoted to do Level classifications again for all your help with this issue I really enjoy classifying the many new glitches! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Almost no background noise! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Got this error message while searching for glitches similar to the subject Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site I guess it may be related to several lockloss events happened during that day but the shape is quite weird and I cannot obtain any rather fine timestamp for this subject for further correlation to be honest I am not even sure with what can I correlate besides logbook and detector status page Anyway would be happy to know if it is normal to have some subject present on zooniverse website and missing somewhere else as well as get some tips on how to treat such examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Apologies for the invoncenience! Last year there were occasional hiccups with the subject upload process which resulted in repeated upload attempts and thus in accidental duplications and it has not been feasible to clean up completely afterwards The present glitch is one of that happened between and at Hanford cause unknown and not related to locklosses but nearly each of them was uploaded to Zooniverse five times under five different subject numbers without making it into the Gravity Spy tools before finally being successfully uploaded a sixth time The good and usable subjects from those days have numbers 9636xxxx the earlier 9287xxxx through 9343xxxx should be considered as extraneous duplicates If we were to remove them from Zooniverse now we would also orphan the associated Talk threads and produce inconsistencies in any collections containing them The usable version of the present subject is tab As to how to deal with the duplicates I would frown at them flag them as such by adding them to suitable marker collections and move on to the next subject There's also a small handful of subjects showing other kinds of glitches of which two or more copies exist in the Similarity Seach database and these can produce a different nondescript error when one asks for fewer results than the number of copies There used to be many more during O many subjects had been ingested four or five times and there was one that had got uploaded more than a thousand times those had been cleared out at one point leaving only one representative subject of each glitch Clearing out the few that exist at the present time would require a disproportionate amount of manual effort so we've left them alone https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ oki thanks for clarification! Recently I started getting glitches from this sequence one after another but was unable to find any info in Talk Btw how did you manage to find usable version of the subject in question? Definitely not by brute forcing subject IDs matching right? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Yes well observed you'll see this in a number of ancient subjects If I am not mistaken the reason is that back then well before my time the normalized noise energy was fed into the colormap as is whereas more recent subjects use the logarithm of the normalized energy which will show some finer glitch details as well as the random background more clearly Noise levels within a single subject image can vary by five orders of magnitude even after the removal of stationary noise "whitening" during preprocessing https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ One of our veteran volunteers who is currently taking a break from Zooniverse had collected almost all of these two hundred something Hz glitch subjects as they come up whilst classifying Once our systematic similarity searches across the good ones found no further examples it was a matter of looking at each of the good ones in turn find its exact copies in the twenty odd collection pages where twelve subject per page are displayed write down the relationships in an offline file and remove the copies from the bulk collection so this eyeball search became easier with each glitch that we had dealt with A few duplicates had been missed and only showed up later and these could be tied in by eyeballing the collection of good representatives which fits on pages https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Can someone shed some light on what to classify this one please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ I have seen quite a few of these "512" short lines How to classify please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ I see a few of these strong solid line at Classification same as ripple? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ I have not seen this type before Any thoughts? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/ So some of the fainter glitches g scratchy were just not visible back then? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Scattered light with somerhing faint above very faint blip maybe? I put this as NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430538/ Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and thank you for contributing! None Of The Above is always an option whenever something doesn't want to fit easily into the available classes And this is often the case at present During the fourth observing run that's now in progress after three years of upgrades tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2800503?comment the LIGO interferometers have been producing a glitch mix that's very different from anything we had seen before Some old glitch classes still occur in recognizable forms some still occur but look different some no longer occur and quite a few completely new things tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk have been coming up The present subject comes from a brief episode on tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk when one of Livingston's feedback control loops had failed and over the course of a mere three minutes the interferometer drifted so far from its working point that the lock was lost We already see multiple things going on at once here repeating blips violin mode harmonics a wandering line While it's not at all obvious it was one of the repeating blips that triggered this subject But None Of The Above is certainly appropriate too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ None Of The Above They were a completely new and unexpected thing tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk when they suddenly started happening in large numbers during three days in late May and early June https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ Well noted! Again I would recommend None Of The Above These Hz glitches were another new thing when they showed up on at Hanford and then stopped happening again at the end of the month Only such glitches seem to have been recorded too few to justify a formal glitch class proposal the cause remains a mystery Around that time there were hiccups with the uploading of subjects to the Gravity Spy tools tab The Ripples have not reoccurred in the 3rd and 4th observing runs but there are some lookalikes that have been confusing the Gravity Spy Machine Learning too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ Yet another type of None Of The Above! These mini jolts like the Hz glitches come from beam jitter when the laser beam wobbles sideways by a tiny amount already before it enters the first vacuum chamber On this particular occasion on technicians had been pulling fiber cables under the raised floors near the control room to connect a fire alarm panel The connection to these glitches was soon noted tab Why not start a collection of these? It will come in helpful There isn't a formal glitch class proposal for these jitter glitches yet but I guess there have been enough of them to justify one once we can support it with collections of representative subjects https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/ They would have been visible when they occurred on their own thanks to the energy normalization but not when anything louder was also present https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Well observed! Yes that's a blip up there and looking at the reported peak frequency of Hz it was what triggered this subject although the image rendering then paid more attention to the accompanying scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430538/ Not sure if I should post it here but I didn't find any other suitable board to post it in anyway For the past days since I switched to level I constantly get similar subjects Sometimes they go one after another sometimes zooniverse put 'golden' subjects between them but what I mostly get is either H O Hz transient lines which do not have a clickable classification for them but were described in details in this thread Example https imgur com a AGZbIwX https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3430635/ https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3430635/ No problem and glad to hear that it worked and you're enjoying it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ the true chirp !

When you have a general question or suggestion you can start a new thread in the most suitable of our Talk tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk boards after a quick look whether there's already an existing thread about the topic better than adding to an existing thread about something else and changing the topic And when you encounter the same kind of unusual glitch several times why not start a collection of them and bring it up for show and tell in the Talk > Collections tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk board once it seems presentable? There are quite a lot of novel glitches nowadays that won't easily fit into any existing class and representative collections will come in useful for characterizing them again for contributing! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ HI this is interesting > It has long been suspected that single dust grains which occasionally fall through the beam in one of the arms can be the cause of loud glitches Has this been happening over the years despite the vacuum chambers and clean rooms? The collection looks equally interesting bearing certain general similarities to other glitches going around so I hope that the researches will be able to add some Q scan images to look further into this https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3431042/ Yes the level workflow is currently a bit of a junk yard Part of the reason is that when the Hz transients first appeared the Gravity Spy Machine Learning unprepared for such a thing labeled almost all of them as Whistle with a high estimated confidence which caused the automated workflow preselection to assign them to the entry level or workflows when they were first uploaded to Zooniverse Once this had been noticed those subject sets were manually reassigned to level to ensure volunteers would only see them after having acquired some general experience Then when the Hz beeps first appeared the same thing happened again only compounded this time by upload issues which resulted in a large number of duplicated subjects tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3429888?comment So those also got reassigned to level Together they add up to about six hundred subjects A third factor at play is that towards the end of last year it was noticed that the Machine Learning had been systematically over estimating its own confidence This was adjusted before the second half O4b of the fourth observing run began in April this year This adjustment has affected the workflow preselection even some glitches that are "obviously" Blips or "obviously" Scattered Light now get pre labeled with low confidence or mis labeled and end up in one of the more advanced workflows in hard to predict ways One side effect of this is that the level workflow appears to be somewhat starved of subjects aside from the Hz and Hz ones and aside from the gold standard sets A fourth factor is that fresh uploads have stalled since the researchers are working on getting them restarted and catching up on the backlog Moreover Hanford had been offline for six weeks beginning in mid July to undertake repairs and didn't produce any fresh subjects during this time Once new subjects are streaming in again the picture may change a bit and level may once more offer more varied challenges Keeping fingers crossed crossed fingers https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3430635/ As far as I know this mechanism has never before been conclusively proved but it is believed to have been happening at a low rate for many years yes despite all the cleaning and baking or firing of all vacuum facing surfaces before they were assembled Bear in mind that the insides of the km long beam tubes or even just their upper halves add up to a lot of surface area and they've been in an uninterrupted hard vacuum for decades thus inacessible to inspections let alone interventions https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3431042/ good to know this other detail https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3431042/ Fuzzy range 30 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3431583/ A few general further thoughts sprinkled with some aux channel names The AERM PDs would witness dust events that happen not too far from one arm end but may not witness all dust events Stray light flashes from events in the middle of the arm or closer to an input end would mostly end up on the beam tube baffles and ACBs and the fraction which reaches these monitoring PDs may not rise above background noise levels When they do witness an event they'll provide a measurement of the time the particle took to traverse the beam and thus a lower limit on the beam diameter at that point The longest lasting events would come from particles passing almost centrally through the beam and fairly close to an ETM where the diameter is largest What happens in one arm won't stay in one arm When the light field in one arm is momentarily disturbed in both amplitude and phase the disturbance will couple within milliseconds into the Power Recycling Cavity into the Signal Recycling Cavity and onto the DC photodiodes and thence into the DARM loop It will then be recycled back into both arms and the DARM loop will react to the perceived displacement by acting on one designated end test mass and on the upper masses of both end test mass suspensions now causing a real deviation from the DARM working point which will be counteracted during the following tens to hundreds of milliseconds When the disturbance is strong enough one or more DARM actuators may get saturated and we'll see an even louder glitch with I expect larger noise content towards higher frequencies But DARM actuation saturations can happen for other reasons too when the DARM loop counteracts some seismic disturbance of the quad suspensions Those events the loudest glitches that are with luck survivable without losing the lock SNRs can exceed will never be witnessed by the AERM PDs So it may be useful to look not only at the two AERM PD sum channels L ASC X Y TR ERM NSUM OUT DQ but also at eight PUM coil L degree of freedom and four ESD quadrant L degree of freedom actuation channels where saturations would stand out L SUS ETM X Y L COILOUTF UL UR LL LR OUTPUT L SUS ETMX L ESDOUTF UL UR LL LR OUTPUT there are also the UIM coil L o channels but they would be unlikely to saturate without L and or L also hitting the ceiling What we can hope to glean from this is a breakdown into the subset of loud glitches with AERM PD witnesses without saturation the subset with both AERM PD witnesses and saturation the subset without AERM PD witnesses but with saturation Saturation events not involving dust should all be in the third subset Events involving dust may show up in any of the three Events in the first two subsets are likely to involve dust Plus some borderline cases without either kind of witness And then it'll be interesting whether the "GS 0" visual appearance combined with Omicron metadata esp the SNR would already allow to predict the subset to which a glitch subject belongs My current pet hypothesis which may turn out wrong is that significant noise content above Hz witnessed by extensive two sided artefacts up there will correlate with saturation events And conversely that the first subset is going to correspond to loud glitches with extensive lateral artefacts only below Hz Based on O examples I've already seen extensive artefacts above Hz tend to go with higher SNRs generally above lack thereof usually goes with SNRs below but there's a region of overlap between SNR and both morphologies can occur Some Hanford operators diligently mention saturations which come with verbal alerts in the control room in their shift reports Since they are rare on average a few per hour shift it has often been possible to tie them in with individual subjects even when I a priori know the subject timestamp only to within minutes or so These subjects consistently come with high SNRs > and broad artefacts well above Hz Unfortunately Livingston operators only rarely mention these things nowadays

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2\n- **"Pirate Ships"**: This glitch is identified due to its appearance linked with beam jitter, where the laser beam wobbles sideways a little at the point where it enters the first vacuum chamber. The phenomenon shows up at frequencies around and just above 60Hz and has been partially mitigated since October. While not yet officially recognized as a class, it\'s been noted enough times to potentially warrant formal classification.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429184/\n\n### 2. Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n- **Doubts on Machine Learning (ML) Classifications**: There is an emerging concern about the Machine Learning algorithm mislabeling certain glitches as "No Glitch" or incorrectly assigning them to other categories. This skepticism about ML accuracy persists across both datasets, raising questions about its reliability and the potential need for reevaluation and improvement of the ML process.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3399349/\n\n### 3. Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects \n- **Questions on the Impact of Environmental Factors on Glitches**: There\'s a rising curiosity on how environmental factors like storms or local seismic activities can influence the appearance of glitches. These questions are motivated by trying to link specific external events with the timing and characteristics of recorded glitches.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425841/\n- **Inquiries about Data Handling and Sensor Performance**: Some citizen scientists are questioning how data handling, specifically regarding sensor calibration and maintenance, might affect glitch occurrences. This indicates a deeper dive into the technical setup of LIGO and its operational protocols.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3431587/\n\n### 4. Hypotheses on the Origins of Glitches\n- **Hypothesis on Dust Particles Causing Glitches**: A hypothesis presented suggests that dust particles falling through the beam in one of the arms might cause significant glitches. This is motivated by the observation of glitches correlating with suspected dust events, despite the vacuum environment supposed to prevent such occurrences.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3431042/\n- **Theory on Beam Jitter Caused by Nearby Technological Activities**: There\'s a theory that activities such as cable pulling or other operational movements near the sensors can induce beam jitter, leading to specific glitch signatures. This hypothesis stems from the analytical tracking of operational logs coinciding with glitch occurrences.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/\n\n### 5. Questions Concerning Connections to Sensors or Channels\n- **Specific Channel-Related Queries**: There\'s an increase in discussions about specific channels and their roles, especially concerning how auxiliary channels like the AERM PDs (Amplitude and Phase Error Monitoring Photodiodes) might capture or miss certain events. These queries are driven by an intention to understand better which channels are crucial for identifying or confirming certain types of glitches.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3431042/\n- **Sensor Sensitivity to Environmental Vibrations**: Questions are raised about how environmental vibrations and their coupling to sensors could be leading to noise in the gravitational strain measurements.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

One possibility I've been mulling over and which may turn out to be wrong is that Cairns might be another part of the same population as Vibration Eruptions tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 1009409?comment where in the latter case the reflecting item the cryopump baffles used to be the prime suspect would be vibrating with larger amplitude thus upconverting the noise to higher frequencies at the culmination and as a byproduct also raising the decay phase which lasts a few seconds to frequencies above Hz where it doesn't get completely drowned out by the stationary background noise Like Cairns Vibration Eruptions attract renderings at a variety of Q values and they are roughly equally rare In this light it is interesting that you've picked up three in between subjects that I would be inclined to file under Vibration Eruption ! frame and tab which has just brought up in Talk may be yet another in between case It would be interesting to learn what the PEM beamtube accelerometer aux channels have to say about all these glitches especially those near the four cryopumps at each site By the way last week I had added another O3b example with renderings at all four Q values of a plausible Cairn to an earlier entry on the first page tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3399349?comment of this present thread https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Noting in passing that there are other ongoing mislabeling issues on an even larger scale Hundreds of O4b glitches caused by rung up Violin Mode Harmonics have been getting mis labeled as No Glitch by the ML and have been placed into entry level workflows where they'll get mis classified as such by new volunteers too And lots of higher Q renderings of glitches peaking near Hz from Livingston " Hz monster" fuzzy range week tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3314162?comment to have been mis labeled as Power Line and have likewise wound up in the entry level workflows https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ for the feedback and explanations Interesting to see for how many years Vibration Eruptions have lived through If I picked three subjects that may fit this other class there is always a possibility that one belongs to the other Regarding the Vibration proposal > Shorter duration version lasts almost sec but it is usually longer sec long vibration glitch is not unusual Duration above would not fit Cairn O preliminary characteristics Subspecies perhaps?

There's this thing about looking at the strain channel and an auxiliary channel side by side known as "Gravity Spy 0" > All those mis labelling at a larger scale Well I can't blame the old ML for not knowing what to do with a genuinely new kind of glitch but it needs to be watched by human eyes and should not be blindly trusted to feed Gravity Spy on Zooniverse with a decent distribution of easy and less easy subjects For that matter I myself shouldn't be blindly trusted by anyone either! I have neither the time nor the strength to keep looking at everything that needs to be looked at day in day out I keep making mistakes here and there like everyone for all my habitual sanity checking and proofreading before clicking the Submit button And there's too little double checking and critical feedback about my sometimes apodictic verdicts coming back to me https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ for the additional explanations Needless to say you keep doing an extraordinary job above and beyond on many fronts Regarding ML As seen from outside it seems that the vast amount of new glitch classes and newly found glitches known yet not proposed overwhelms the ML capacity and management to keep it updated improved even being more able to label correctly for example older glitches Regarding PEM > It would be interesting to learn what the PEM beamtube accelerometer aux channels have to say about all these glitches especially those near the four cryopumps at each site Right GS We would need to catch a pair of Livingston Main and PEM aux channels to pop up in the classifier related to the glitches being discussed to see what they say Then seeing and remembering that mainly only?

Good morning By looking again at the three Cairn glitches that I had collected of which you suspect above are Vibration Eruptions while sim search metadata is within what was defined earlier for Cairn I find them slightly different now in that the "mound" is broken or disheveled Most other Cairn form a more solid or structured full of bright energy mound Here is a look at page in my Cairn L collection turned all to frame Those suspected stand out now The pf is higher for these three subjects going from Hz through Hz while most of Cairn collected stay around Hz mainly the Hz range Perhaps this might be a hint? ! cairn vibration https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ Excellent I fathom the huge job in building GS workflows and this proposed Cairn addition you mention would be fantastic if the team is able to do it Great explanations on this topic of PEM interest Many thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/729/3399349/ It's intentional that the first two levels are traversed quickly and subsequent levels take longer not least because they need volunteer input and would be starved of input if people were advancing too quickly but submissions for which many thanks anyway! ought to be enough to unlock level Sanity check have you still been seeing occasional gold standard subjects e those which give feedback? If yes I would recommend you post a follow up in the other thread next door tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3398363?comment where the researchers are already watching Manually unlocking a level or three should not prevent further levels from being unlocked automatically once a number of gold standard submissions have been received which cover all classes for which such subjects exist https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ I have been seeing occasional gold standard subjects and usually I identify them correctly I'll try to reach subjects before responding to the thread you mentioned just to be sure https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3406194/ Double tailed koifish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424977/ scattered light ? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ I put this as none of the above however I think this might be koi fish https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Can the measuring equipment measure frequencies above 2048?

This is a good question and I don't know the answer After one of the hundreds of feedback control loops that normally cooperate to maintain a good lock had failed outright when one camera monitoring the beam alignment had stopped working there were multiple unusual things going on at once By the time the present subject was recorded a couple minutes later the Livingston interferometer had already drifted so far from its intended working point that a lockloss was less than seconds away Bits and pieces of this wandering line are visible in a number of subjects from the surrounding minutes tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk I haven't seen anything similar to it in any Livingston O subjects recorded in more normal conditions Do watch out though for a Wandering Line undulating more slowly in a few dozen Hanford O subjects from last January https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3064584/ Yes to fixes applied a few years ago most of it nowadays happens below the Hz bottom edge of our spectrograms we only get to see the topmost parts of the action https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ NOTA is fine when something doesn't want to fit into the available classes This subject shows a coincidental mix of two different independent glitches The tall central feature with hints of "lighthouse" decorations could be called a Blip although it's a bit of a stretch if it had been louder it would turn into a kind of Extremely Loud The "wheatgrass" surrounding it below Hz is a form of Scattered Light rendered as rows of beatnote pulses here because this subject was processed with very fine time resolution at the expense of very coarse frequency resolution The "fins" of a Koi Fish would look somewhat similar but more symmetric and at slightly higher frequencies https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ The raw data are recorded at a rate of samples per second so frequencies up to Hz could be extracted with some distortion and up to a little beyond Hz in sufficient quality to create images like ours this isn't normally done here since it costs extra memory and processing time and most glitches don't need it I don't have a timestamp for the present subject so I can't produce another image of this particular Whistle even though the raw data from the first three observing runs are public by now but see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2079928?comment page for some other examples and illustrations! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Another great question! Some old examples aside it is safe to assume that every Gravity Spy subject from recent and ongoing observing runs contains a glitch or rarely a real gravitational wave chirp something that exceeded the ever present background noise levels by at least a factor of But that Something isn't always visible in the resulting image The Gravity Spy tools tab Watch out for other NotNoGlitch subjects There are many with reported peak frequencies around or around Hz betraying a violin mode origin quite a few from Hanford at or Hz which tend to belong into a proposed new class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk some from Hanford at or Hz and more from Livingston at Hz which belong into another propopsed class tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and some others https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ What happens when a participant chooses NOTA? Does it get sent to a higher level for further inspection? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ I just checked the datasets at gwosc to see if I could get the data from there but it looks like data from January to November is missing entirely? Why is this? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ First of all This is an extraneous subject there must exist another where the obvious extremely loud glitch appears properly centered I haven't seen it yet but it would probably look somewhat like tab recorded a day and a half earlier The difference in appearance is due to rendering choices coarse vs fine time resolution combined with fine vs coarse frequency resolution Why do we get such extraneous off center subjects? Mostly because the glitch detection software inspects minute long chunks of data at a time setting to work in near real time whenever another minute's worth of data has become available The "outskirts" of a loud glitch near the end of one chunk can then cause another spurious detection at the beginning of the next chunk as in this case or the onset of a loud glitch near the beginning of a fresh chunk can already have caused a spurious detection at the end of the preceding chunk Next This one did not cause a lockloss we see clean data with just the usual amount of faint random background noise everywhere in the right half of the fourth frame But similar glitches are among the loudest that a LIGO interferometer can with luck survive without losing its lock tab is one of the loudest such I've seen at an SNR above And even louder ones can cause a lockloss E this one did some seconds beyond the " s" right edge of the fourth frame ! frame What causes this kind of extremely loud glitches? Ultimately earthquakes or thunderclaps or very strong gusts of wind which despite the multi stage seismic isolation manage to cause one or more of the mirror suspensions to shake The feedback control loops which keep the arm length difference "DARM" constant to within a picometer a millionth of a micrometer and those which keep the test masses mirrors at their proper angles to allow the laser light to bounce back and forth between them more than a hundred times operate in a mode with limited actuation strength and low noise once the lock has been acquired They can compensate and damp some amount of unwanted motion but not a lot When more force would be needed than is available things will momentarily depart from the proper working point resulting in a sudden LOT of noise in the data and a loudspeaker in the control room will automatically issue a verbal alert like "EX saturation!" to the operator With luck acting a little longer with the limited force available may still suffice to recover from the disturbance or it may not the lock may be lost a fast shutter closes within milliseconds to protect the detection photodiodes the input laser power is ramped down the remaining circulating laser light ends up in beam dumps and the lock would need to be reacquired slowly The saturation and lockloss illustrated above at 19T was caused by an earthquake and goes with LLO tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ In case of a no glitch should I use the tools to see if this is really the case and then report as NOTA if there is something? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ I'll have a look at the tools I assume these should only be used when the glitch class isn't clear? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ In the long run yes or it may just be kept around until all the newly discovered glitch classes have been studied sufficiently to re train the Machine Learning and to make some of them official so that further submissions can then mark them as "one of the above" And in any case NOTA ensures that more people are going to get a look! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Because the first Observing Run of Advanced LIGO ended on and the second started on GWOSC only holds published data tab Engineering Runs are thus excluded weekly maintenance periods are excluded routine half hour calibration measurement periods are excluded and of course there are no data from times when the observatories weren't observing g recovering from a lockloss or weren't even running because of lengthy upgrades tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2800503?comment between observing runs https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ You mention SNR what is this a measurement of? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Ah ok so gravity spy uses all data? this subject is from https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ Ah ok how accurate has the algorithm gotten so far? Anywhere I can read up on this? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ It's up to you how deeply you want to delve into each subject! Sometimes Similarity Search provides insights that aren't easy to come by in other ways Personally I am going to some extremes but I certainly don't expect everybody else to do so I will run a "NotNoGlitch" subject through a similarity search for result immediately based on the character identifier which I can already access while classifying just to see whether it belongs under Violin Modes or Low Frequency Lines or somewhere else Otherwise I'll just make a note of the subject number to return to it later I would usually add a subject to an appropriate collection only after it has been returned as a result from a small similarity search starting from another subject by which time I would also have written down the peak frequency and other metadata and eyeballed an approximate timestamp to within minutes or so and then I feed the collected subject's number back into another sim search to keep my to do queues populated I also keep track of how often each subject has appeared as a sim search result In this way I can gradually build collections of the most representative subjects of each kind Cascades of many small searches asking for rather fewer than results each time tend to work much better for exploring an underlying populations than doing only a few searches asking for many results Of course the tool being image based mixes up all the NotNoGlitch subjects https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424992/ Signal to background Noise Ratio or in this case glitch noise level divided by background noise level https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ The "date" stamps of old subjects are dummy values reflecting the date on which the upload script was last modified Only since the fourth observing run do we have the real event date available through the nfo button Admittedly this is a little confusing but then almost all old subjects have been deactivated from the workflows in order to focus on the new material except for the gold standard subjects and for a selection of Whistles from O to make up for a total lack of Whistles from O so far The present subject dates from the first observing run and was uploaded to Zooniverse in October after results from a pilot phase of the budding project had been evaluated Subjects from later runs have the run number embedded in their titles after the observatory name https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ To be frank at the moment the Machine Learning is all over the place The glitch mix coming from the LIGO observatories during the ongoing fourth observing run differs very much from anything we've seen before and from everything the ML had previously been trained for We still have recognizable Blips and Koi Fish but Scattered Light looks very different now and there are many completely new things tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk and some new things that look deceptively similar to old glitch classes that haven't reoccurred in years or whose causes have been completely eliminated in the course of observatory upgrades And changing anything in the ML takes time tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3369772?comment One fairly recent paper is Y Wu al Advancing Glitch Classification in Gravity Spy Multi view Fusion with Attention based Machine Learning for Advanced LIGO's Fourth Observing Run tab You'll find this along with a selection of older material linked from Talk > Help > Resources tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk very much for your sustained interest! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ for the comprehensive answer!

Just a question for my own understanding I'm aware that a fair amount of browser side Zooniverse state both PFE and FEM is cached in session storage Are cookies currently also being used for anything aside from authentication and statistics gathering? Or would this be the first use of cookies for maintaining functional state? Why I am asking is When a volunteer switches among several devices or among several different browsers browser profiles on one device session state for which the single source of truth is on the server side will be fetched and cached and the new session will be in sync with where the previous session had left off But cookies won't carry over This might cause surprises If there's already other functional state that's kept in cookies then I'd expect fewer surprises But if not then a solution based on the existing per user per project project preferences stored server side and cached browser side might be preferable in the long term so as to have all such features work in similar ways The server side project preferences already remember in which workflow of the project I've been active most recently and if I'm not mistaken they are already being fetched by both frontends when a classifier is launched so the information would be available to the frontends it's just not being used at the moment https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ I'll have a look at the paper you sent very much for the quick and helpful answers! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424985/ Fair enough https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/418228/ So 95440075's glitch is times louder ? clearer? brighter? than the background? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Yes that's it "Louder" is probably the best word Astronomers speak of a binary neutron star merger as a " standard siren tab The SNR is computed in relation to the small random background fluctuations not in relation to the DC light level Also ever present stationary noise a lot of it esp at low frequencies but also at a number of fixed higher frequencies is removed before considering the random background and computing SNRs Here's a plot of yesterday's stationary background noise levels from the detector status summary page for the day tab ! IGWN sensitivity Some LIGO noise features you can find in there include suspension noise near and near and Hz a mostly subtracted out bunch of calibration lines around Hz the Hz mains frequency the violin modes of the beam splitter suspension near Hz and those of the test mass suspensions near Hz and multiples thereof Virgo's fundamental violin modes show up near Hz and multiples and Virgo's Hz mains subtraction has been doing a good job leaving only a modest peak in the violet curve The steep overall rise on the left is mostly due to a combination of seismic noise thermal noise radiation pressure noise on the test masses and residual motion of the suspensions The less steep rise on the right is shot noise from the detection photodiodes picking up the incoming light in discrete quanta already mitigated as far as possible by quantum squeezing tab https en wikipedia org wiki Squeezed states of light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ What causes 60hz glitches to appear even when mitigated? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ I put none of the above Might be blip though https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425677/ Since scattered light doesn't have arches as obvious as before shouldn't the examples in the glitch selection be updated? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ Tiny high frequency glitch https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425678/ That depends We've had a few genuine Power Line glitches from Livingston during O so far which tend to look like these with a characteristic pair of "eyes" and with varying amounts of spillover to other frequencies ! frame They are caused by some Hz alternating current circuit switching on and off or off and on faster than the line subtraction filtering can follow The ever present Hz noise will be momentarily overcompensated then undercompensated then overcompensated again The stationary Hz noise mostly couples through magnetic fields There's a number of voltage monitors current monitors and magnetometers deployed and for each of them the correlation to the differential arm length measurements is known and periodically re measured and used to calibrate the subtraction But any filtering or subtraction confined to a very narrow frequency band necessarily takes time to react to changing conditions And while the subtraction is good overall or else the Hz peak in the noise spectrum would be much higher! it isn't perfect the actual coupling sites aren't quite where the magnetometers are You might enjoy skimming the paper P Nguyen al Environmental Noise in Advanced LIGO Detectors tab But there are also other kinds of glitches at adjacent frequencies unrelated to the electricity mains and not covered by the Hz mitigation E The suspensions of some auxiliary optics have a "bounce mode" resonance near Hz which can show up tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk at multiples thereof including Hz ! frame Between and Livingston experienced a series of very varied glitches tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3314162?comment that seriously impacted the sensitivity mostly with peak frequencies of Hz or multiples thereof Some of these could look deceptively like Hz "line" noise ! frame After a lot of noise hunting by the engineers the cause for these along a complicated coupling path turned out tab tightened https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Footnote Narrowband noise spectral lines are dealt with in different ways on different time scales The published data on GWOSC have been carefully cleaned offline over the course of months after the end of each observing run The near realtime data on which the plots on the status summary pages are based have undergone near realtime cleaning which since it needs to be fast and has to rely on estimates extrapolations of slowly changing parameters can't be quite as good The Omicron software looks for glitches in a raw data stream that hasn't yet been line cleaned Gravity Spy subject images are created from the same raw data after a preprocessing "whitening" step which somewhat imperfectly subdues any noise which looks stationary on timescales of around one minute So what we see in our subject images is based on a cruder form of line noise suppression than the data that are later uploaded to GWOSC https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Panoptes authentication uses a secure cookie That been true since the Panoptes API launched in Session cookies are used for some other bits of user personalisation like remembering whether you prefer a light or dark theme User preferences aren dated so I can see which workflow you last worked on but I don know if that was last week or last year That leads to bugs most notably a project team sends out an email with a link to their classify page previous volunteers follow the link and their preferences load a completed workflow This in turn leads to excess classifications on subjects that have already been completed https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ Ok thank you for the clarification! We'll see how this plays out then https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ One improvement that has been made in the new code is that you can link directly to specific workflows by workflow ID That a lot more reliable than trying to guess from user preferences eg https www zooniverse org projects zooniverse gravity spy classify workflow 1610 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ At some point they will be once the detector engineers and the machine learning experts have reached a consensus about how best to address the needs At the present time it isn't even clear yet how best to carve up the glitches lately caused by scattered light into classes that are on the one hand amenable to classifying by their images limited to frequencies above Hz and to seconds' worth on the time axis and on the other hand make sense from an engineering perspective Considering the impact on clean observing time glitches which remain confined below Hz do less harm than glitches showing up at higher frequencies From this angle it might make sense to maintain the distinction between Scattered Light with arches visible above Hz and Low Frequency Burst without such even though the same causes are at work From a cause hunting angle lumping them together looks more attractive From a mitigation angle if something can be done to push the arches below Hz it would already be considered good progress and once again separate classes would help to measure the benefits And from an ML angle the current neural network is struggling to make sense of edge cases like tab or tab but also with obvious rows of arches la Livingston O ! frame Upgrading and retraining the ML would help along with selecting new sets of example illustrations and of gold standard subjects along the way but would make it hard to compare future ML and volunteer classifications to existing ML and volunteer classifications of older subjects unless all the older subjects are also reprocessed and the Detector Characterization team expends extra time to familiarize themselves with the revised results So there is no easy win We've learned many lessons over the years and there are certainly things we'd do differently if we were to start over from scratch including better ways to adapt to unforeseen changes in the glitch mix For the moment we'll have to live within the limitations of the existing ML design use our human eyes and brains trained by millions of years of evolution to recognize ripe fruit and tiger stripes behind the foliage build representative collections and keep working on gradually improving the whole affair And your input is much appreciated! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3424979/ So a very large part of the noise is being removed just not everything? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Yes much is removed but not everything and especially not everything in near real time https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425035/ Pretty severe scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3425841/ Huh thus is wild indeed Nice catch!

Indeed this was a completely new kind of glitch tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk first noted from LIGO Hanford on The cause remains unkown In late April another series of similar looking glitches happened again at Hanford during a couple of days And then from until we got a few hundred somewhat similar glitches from Livingston two of which are among your similarity search results In that case the cause is known it turned out tab Glitches from all three of these episodes have attracted a mix of low Q and high Q renderings so they differ widely in appearance If you want to see for yourself how a Blip changes in appearance under different rendering choices let's take one from O where the precise event timestamps and raw data have been published by now Head to the glitch plotter tab The same can be done with a published Binary Black Hole BBH chirp from O say GW tab Per the current version of the LIGO Data Management Plan tab way https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426474/ Yes the top of one arch just barely peeping over the bottom edge and then the top of a lesser parallel arch just above the dark Hz stationary noise band https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426516/ Because each of these baby Koi glitches is a very close overlapping double two humps at the top end and often a few dark holes down the middle where the two short duration things partially cancel https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426519/ Not too fuzzy just Scattered Light rendered at Q in between wheatgrass and scattering comb shapes https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ It hard working out which is which! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ I find it very difficult to make out Easily missed! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426516/ Be assured that you're miles ahead of the ML in this regard https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ ! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ I ve updated the GitHub PR to explain how a SameSite cookie protects against accidentally loading the wrong workflow when following a link from an email or external site https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3206987/ As a matter of interest maybe to others like myself what on earth is ConvNN?

We are having a talk about AI in our village hall next month so I thought I would try and get my head around it Sorry I should have started a new chat conversation https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ Among the various O "NotNoGlitch" subjects a few hundred mostly from Hanford O4b stand out They have peak frequencies near or near Hz and are readily tied to logbook entries about rung up violin modes The Machine Learning has been calling them No Glitch and indeed there's nothing much to see yet Omicron had triggered on them as excess noise with SNRs above or else they wouldn't exist as Gravity Spy subjects But it turns out that they don't actually represent glitches in the strain channel They represent elevated stationary noise levels in DARM and strain varying only gradually on time scales of minutes to hours They really originate as glitches in the glitch detection itself Thus I'm documenting them here as a distinct subclass of Violin Mode Harmonics Proposed Name LIGO O Invisible Violins ID of proposer Date of proposal Reference subjects for Classifier and Field Guide S holotype linked above S S S ! frame showing the second frames Short description Nothing at all stands out visually Minor unrelated noise may be present The peak frequencies accessible through Similarity Search tab Characteristics As above SNRs rarely exceed All Q value choices can occur Overlapping pairs of subjects are unusually common see below Hash tags a Collections NB the metadata links do not work at present pending a DYCWMI tool bugfix but will work once the tool has been fixed no training set at this time since the current Machine Learning doesn't take Omicron metadata into account Bulk collections growing H ER O4a Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h er a invisible violins link to its metadata tab L ER O4a Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant l er a invisible violins link to its metadata tab H ER O4b Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant h er b invisible violins link to its metadata tab L ER O4b Invisible Violins tab projects zooniverse gravity spy collections zngabitant l er b invisible violins link to its metadata tab Collaborators Remarks In fact not only is there an unusual excess of overlapping pairs of subjects these pairs also straddle full second boundaries at one minute intervals The examples from all come just before or just after a GPS second that fell seconds after a multiple of Those from all happened seconds after a multiple of On the other hand the seconds periodicity tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk of the Pizzicato glitches from O has disappeared completely Example pairs more will keep turning up from between and UTC tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab and from between and UTC tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab What must have been happening here is that Omicron in the presence of a rung up violin mode or other loud stationary narrowband noise tends to trigger near the end of its current seconds chunk of data and then again near the beginning of the next seconds chunk Sometimes only one member of such a pair of triggers will exceed the SNR > threshold for creating a Gravity Spy subject Sometimes both would remain too faint to show up here https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ So what to do about these triggers? Are they useful? Are they necessary? Could we do without them? The observatory operators and the data quality team on their weekly shifts don't need them rung up violin modes are reported in other more direct ways They do add some spice to the Gravity Spy volunteer experience One more sort of thing that requires taking a closer look and extracting the peak frequency using the Similarity Search tool tab It is likely that they could be avoided by padding the minute long data chunks on which Omicron operates with shoulders of at least seconds on both sides my experience whilst working with the glitch plotter tab So it may be better to keep things as they are and live with these "glitches" It's worth noting that the Virgo team had encountered a very similar issue at the beginning of O tab O https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ For the record below I am listing documented episodes of rung up violin modes from which we've seen visible or invisible fallout as Gravity Spy subjects ER LHO LHO tab O4a LHO 04ff LHO tab LLO briefly very visible just before a lockloss see here tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk LHO and following ITMY mode and later Hz with a series of logbook entries including LHO tab LHO LHO tab LHO 28ff LHO tab LLO 28f LLO tab LHO LHO tab https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ ER none O4b LLO 15f LLO tab LHO LHO tab LHO LHO tab I have not yet seen any subjects from subequent episodes LHO LHO tab LLO LLO tab LLO 16ff LLO tab LLO 31ff LLO tab LLO LLO tab modes https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3428271/ The images fed to the GravitySpy ML ConvNN day in day out while the observatories are Observing are the same that then get uploaded to Zooniverse as subjects for us to inspect except that the ML gets to "view" all four frames at once side by side and without the title texts colourmap axis tick marks and labels only the four spectrogram images themselves For re training purposes it would be fed a set of around a hundred such images carefully selected and believed to be representative of a single new glitch class In reality it's somewhat more complicated The set is split up randomly into a larger part used for the training phase and a smaller part for testing validation Then the current training subset is run through the neural network adjusting the cell connections in the process and the outcome is evaluated on the current test subset while keeping the connections fixed And then this is repeated with a new random splitting of the given subject set many times until the results no longer improve in further iterations The sort of language oriented AI that has been getting headlines in the last year and a half ChatGPT and friends works completely differently though The only commonalities are that they also run on computers and also need to be trained But they require vastly larger amounts of training data and existing Large Language Models have been trained on data of sometimes extremely dubious quality not to mention copyright infringements on a global scale https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ No doubt people will want to know about ChatGPT I have never used it but have actually heard about it for your explanations https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3426520/ Lockloss https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428724/ School of koi https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428725/ Fuzzy range?

The title subject is a rare Q rendering of a flock as is The remainder of the sim search results is something of a mixed bunch Since the choice of Q value has such a large effect on the general texture of the resulting subject images the Similarity Search tool tends to be more sensitive to the Q value than to the glitch class And since flocks at Q are rare it returns an eclectic mix of other things instead Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Whether you're browsing recent pages or viewing the results of a logbook search is specific to your current browser session and can't be exported through a URL The link you see in the URL field of your browser when you're looking at the search results ends up pointing at the logbook start page for everyone else No loss in the present case since flocks aren't momentous enough as glitches go to earn specific logbook mentions Only individual logbook entries and comments on them can be linked to directly Their URLs can be captured for pasting by using the browser's "Copy link" function on the "Link" button in the entry heading https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ for the feedback and information An eclectic mix indeed as sim search sees it I took a look at the array of subjects tagged with "flock" there is a wide variety of glitches making up a flock seems pretty special > Unfortunately the logbook software provides no way of linking to a list of search results Yes I recalled something about this from previous logbook searches seeing that my draft post returned the Home page after having pasted the URL on top of the search results even though that search URL contained the corresponding "page 1" and "page 2" appended yet switched to the Home page when pasted into the address bar Many thanks! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3428755/ ! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ The center object looks a bit odd https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/102358/ What is the top glitch? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429011/ I just got promoted from gravity spy level to gravity spy level So manually promoting may have fixed it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/

    Now consider Talk Dataset 2:
     for the promotion to Level I did classify on that level which did then allowed me to be promoted to do Level classifications again for all your help with this issue I really enjoy classifying the many new glitches! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ Almost no background noise! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Got this error message while searching for glitches similar to the subject Cannot find zooniverse subject in database This is possibly due to this subject glitch being a duplicate that was removed from the database but not yet the zooniverse site I guess it may be related to several lockloss events happened during that day but the shape is quite weird and I cannot obtain any rather fine timestamp for this subject for further correlation to be honest I am not even sure with what can I correlate besides logbook and detector status page Anyway would be happy to know if it is normal to have some subject present on zooniverse website and missing somewhere else as well as get some tips on how to treat such examples https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Apologies for the invoncenience! Last year there were occasional hiccups with the subject upload process which resulted in repeated upload attempts and thus in accidental duplications and it has not been feasible to clean up completely afterwards The present glitch is one of that happened between and at Hanford cause unknown and not related to locklosses but nearly each of them was uploaded to Zooniverse five times under five different subject numbers without making it into the Gravity Spy tools before finally being successfully uploaded a sixth time The good and usable subjects from those days have numbers 9636xxxx the earlier 9287xxxx through 9343xxxx should be considered as extraneous duplicates If we were to remove them from Zooniverse now we would also orphan the associated Talk threads and produce inconsistencies in any collections containing them The usable version of the present subject is tab As to how to deal with the duplicates I would frown at them flag them as such by adding them to suitable marker collections and move on to the next subject There's also a small handful of subjects showing other kinds of glitches of which two or more copies exist in the Similarity Seach database and these can produce a different nondescript error when one asks for fewer results than the number of copies There used to be many more during O many subjects had been ingested four or five times and there was one that had got uploaded more than a thousand times those had been cleared out at one point leaving only one representative subject of each glitch Clearing out the few that exist at the present time would require a disproportionate amount of manual effort so we've left them alone https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ oki thanks for clarification! Recently I started getting glitches from this sequence one after another but was unable to find any info in Talk Btw how did you manage to find usable version of the subject in question? Definitely not by brute forcing subject IDs matching right? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Yes well observed you'll see this in a number of ancient subjects If I am not mistaken the reason is that back then well before my time the normalized noise energy was fed into the colormap as is whereas more recent subjects use the logarithm of the normalized energy which will show some finer glitch details as well as the random background more clearly Noise levels within a single subject image can vary by five orders of magnitude even after the removal of stationary noise "whitening" during preprocessing https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ One of our veteran volunteers who is currently taking a break from Zooniverse had collected almost all of these two hundred something Hz glitch subjects as they come up whilst classifying Once our systematic similarity searches across the good ones found no further examples it was a matter of looking at each of the good ones in turn find its exact copies in the twenty odd collection pages where twelve subject per page are displayed write down the relationships in an offline file and remove the copies from the bulk collection so this eyeball search became easier with each glitch that we had dealt with A few duplicates had been missed and only showed up later and these could be tied in by eyeballing the collection of good representatives which fits on pages https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429888/ Can someone shed some light on what to classify this one please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ I have seen quite a few of these "512" short lines How to classify please? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ I see a few of these strong solid line at Classification same as ripple? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ I have not seen this type before Any thoughts? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/ So some of the fainter glitches g scratchy were just not visible back then? https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Scattered light with somerhing faint above very faint blip maybe? I put this as NOTA https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430538/ Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk and thank you for contributing! None Of The Above is always an option whenever something doesn't want to fit easily into the available classes And this is often the case at present During the fourth observing run that's now in progress after three years of upgrades tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 2800503?comment the LIGO interferometers have been producing a glitch mix that's very different from anything we had seen before Some old glitch classes still occur in recognizable forms some still occur but look different some no longer occur and quite a few completely new things tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk have been coming up The present subject comes from a brief episode on tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk when one of Livingston's feedback control loops had failed and over the course of a mere three minutes the interferometer drifted so far from its working point that the lock was lost We already see multiple things going on at once here repeating blips violin mode harmonics a wandering line While it's not at all obvious it was one of the repeating blips that triggered this subject But None Of The Above is certainly appropriate too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430118/ None Of The Above They were a completely new and unexpected thing tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk when they suddenly started happening in large numbers during three days in late May and early June https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3000650/ Well noted! Again I would recommend None Of The Above These Hz glitches were another new thing when they showed up on at Hanford and then stopped happening again at the end of the month Only such glitches seem to have been recorded too few to justify a formal glitch class proposal the cause remains a mystery Around that time there were hiccups with the uploading of subjects to the Gravity Spy tools tab The Ripples have not reoccurred in the 3rd and 4th observing runs but there are some lookalikes that have been confusing the Gravity Spy Machine Learning too https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430133/ Yet another type of None Of The Above! These mini jolts like the Hz glitches come from beam jitter when the laser beam wobbles sideways by a tiny amount already before it enters the first vacuum chamber On this particular occasion on technicians had been pulling fiber cables under the raised floors near the control room to connect a fire alarm panel The connection to these glitches was soon noted tab Why not start a collection of these? It will come in helpful There isn't a formal glitch class proposal for these jitter glitches yet but I guess there have been enough of them to justify one once we can support it with collections of representative subjects https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430142/ They would have been visible when they occurred on their own thanks to the energy normalization but not when anything louder was also present https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3429884/ Well observed! Yes that's a blip up there and looking at the reported peak frequency of Hz it was what triggered this subject although the image rendering then paid more attention to the accompanying scattered light https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3430538/ Not sure if I should post it here but I didn't find any other suitable board to post it in anyway For the past days since I switched to level I constantly get similar subjects Sometimes they go one after another sometimes zooniverse put 'golden' subjects between them but what I mostly get is either H O Hz transient lines which do not have a clickable classification for them but were described in details in this thread Example https imgur com a AGZbIwX https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3430635/ https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3430635/ No problem and glad to hear that it worked and you're enjoying it https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ the true chirp !

It's not as if we didn't have enough to do here far from it! I'd just like to encourage the DetChar teams to avail themselves of our volunteer community's full potential whenever something suitable comes along B https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3431042/ Why do my choices of glitches not include all the ones in the Field Guide? I would have classified two of the glitches as Virgo but was not offered that option Please clarify Susan https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ The Virgo glitch classes apply to glitch subjects from the European Virgo interferometer which used to have its own separate workflow in past years currently inactive Despite occasional visual similarities and some real analogies glitches from LIGO Hanford or Livingston won't fit into Virgo classes nor vice versa By the way whenever you spot something unusual or that raises questions in your mind please be welcome to click "Done Talk" straight away instead of "Done" browse any pre existing comments on the subject and add your own questions or remarks! When you have a general question or suggestion you can start a new thread in the most suitable of our Talk tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk boards after a quick look whether there's already an existing thread about the topic better than adding to an existing thread about something else and changing the topic And when you encounter the same kind of unusual glitch several times why not start a collection of them and bring it up for show and tell in the Talk > Collections tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk board once it seems presentable? There are quite a lot of novel glitches nowadays that won't easily fit into any existing class and representative collections will come in useful for characterizing them again for contributing! https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3398363/ HI this is interesting > It has long been suspected that single dust grains which occasionally fall through the beam in one of the arms can be the cause of loud glitches Has this been happening over the years despite the vacuum chambers and clean rooms? The collection looks equally interesting bearing certain general similarities to other glitches going around so I hope that the researches will be able to add some Q scan images to look further into this https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3431042/ Yes the level workflow is currently a bit of a junk yard Part of the reason is that when the Hz transients first appeared the Gravity Spy Machine Learning unprepared for such a thing labeled almost all of them as Whistle with a high estimated confidence which caused the automated workflow preselection to assign them to the entry level or workflows when they were first uploaded to Zooniverse Once this had been noticed those subject sets were manually reassigned to level to ensure volunteers would only see them after having acquired some general experience Then when the Hz beeps first appeared the same thing happened again only compounded this time by upload issues which resulted in a large number of duplicated subjects tab projects zooniverse gravity spy talk 3429888?comment So those also got reassigned to level Together they add up to about six hundred subjects A third factor at play is that towards the end of last year it was noticed that the Machine Learning had been systematically over estimating its own confidence This was adjusted before the second half O4b of the fourth observing run began in April this year This adjustment has affected the workflow preselection even some glitches that are "obviously" Blips or "obviously" Scattered Light now get pre labeled with low confidence or mis labeled and end up in one of the more advanced workflows in hard to predict ways One side effect of this is that the level workflow appears to be somewhat starved of subjects aside from the Hz and Hz ones and aside from the gold standard sets A fourth factor is that fresh uploads have stalled since the researchers are working on getting them restarted and catching up on the backlog Moreover Hanford had been offline for six weeks beginning in mid July to undertake repairs and didn't produce any fresh subjects during this time Once new subjects are streaming in again the picture may change a bit and level may once more offer more varied challenges Keeping fingers crossed crossed fingers https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/730/3430635/ As far as I know this mechanism has never before been conclusively proved but it is believed to have been happening at a low rate for many years yes despite all the cleaning and baking or firing of all vacuum facing surfaces before they were assembled Bear in mind that the insides of the km long beam tubes or even just their upper halves add up to a lot of surface area and they've been in an uninterrupted hard vacuum for decades thus inacessible to inspections let alone interventions https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3431042/ good to know this other detail https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/329/3431042/ Fuzzy range 30 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3431583/ A few general further thoughts sprinkled with some aux channel names The AERM PDs would witness dust events that happen not too far from one arm end but may not witness all dust events Stray light flashes from events in the middle of the arm or closer to an input end would mostly end up on the beam tube baffles and ACBs and the fraction which reaches these monitoring PDs may not rise above background noise levels When they do witness an event they'll provide a measurement of the time the particle took to traverse the beam and thus a lower limit on the beam diameter at that point The longest lasting events would come from particles passing almost centrally through the beam and fairly close to an ETM where the diameter is largest What happens in one arm won't stay in one arm When the light field in one arm is momentarily disturbed in both amplitude and phase the disturbance will couple within milliseconds into the Power Recycling Cavity into the Signal Recycling Cavity and onto the DC photodiodes and thence into the DARM loop It will then be recycled back into both arms and the DARM loop will react to the perceived displacement by acting on one designated end test mass and on the upper masses of both end test mass suspensions now causing a real deviation from the DARM working point which will be counteracted during the following tens to hundreds of milliseconds When the disturbance is strong enough one or more DARM actuators may get saturated and we'll see an even louder glitch with I expect larger noise content towards higher frequencies But DARM actuation saturations can happen for other reasons too when the DARM loop counteracts some seismic disturbance of the quad suspensions Those events the loudest glitches that are with luck survivable without losing the lock SNRs can exceed will never be witnessed by the AERM PDs So it may be useful to look not only at the two AERM PD sum channels L ASC X Y TR ERM NSUM OUT DQ but also at eight PUM coil L degree of freedom and four ESD quadrant L degree of freedom actuation channels where saturations would stand out L SUS ETM X Y L COILOUTF UL UR LL LR OUTPUT L SUS ETMX L ESDOUTF UL UR LL LR OUTPUT there are also the UIM coil L o channels but they would be unlikely to saturate without L and or L also hitting the ceiling What we can hope to glean from this is a breakdown into the subset of loud glitches with AERM PD witnesses without saturation the subset with both AERM PD witnesses and saturation the subset without AERM PD witnesses but with saturation Saturation events not involving dust should all be in the third subset Events involving dust may show up in any of the three Events in the first two subsets are likely to involve dust Plus some borderline cases without either kind of witness And then it'll be interesting whether the "GS 0" visual appearance combined with Omicron metadata esp the SNR would already allow to predict the subset to which a glitch subject belongs My current pet hypothesis which may turn out wrong is that significant noise content above Hz witnessed by extensive two sided artefacts up there will correlate with saturation events And conversely that the first subset is going to correspond to loud glitches with extensive lateral artefacts only below Hz Based on O examples I've already seen extensive artefacts above Hz tend to go with higher SNRs generally above lack thereof usually goes with SNRs below but there's a region of overlap between SNR and both morphologies can occur Some Hanford operators diligently mention saturations which come with verbal alerts in the control room in their shift reports Since they are rare on average a few per hour shift it has often been possible to tie them in with individual subjects even when I a priori know the subject timestamp only to within minutes or so These subjects consistently come with high SNRs > and broad artefacts well above Hz Unfortunately Livingston operators only rarely mention these things nowadays

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-A64Ypp6SAi8W8fO6a78YCVeZldBfM', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="1. **Proposed New Glitch Classes in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Beam Jitter Frequency Bands**: This new glitch class is suggested due to the observation of beam jitter glitches that appear at specific frequency bands. The class is proposed to encompass these glitches that are characterized by their unique frequency band occurrence, distinguishing them from other types of jitter or noise. This classification might help in better understanding and segregating the beam-related anomalies from other signal disturbances. (URLs for reference: /328/3434569, /328/3434504)\n   - **Medium Frequency (MF) Ripple**: Although not entirely new, there is a suggestion to adjust the understanding or categorization of the ripple glitches to specifically highlight their occurrence at medium frequencies. This reclassification or more precise definition helps in distinguishing these glitches from other frequency-specific glitches and acknowledges their unique characteristics in the medium frequency range. (URL for reference: /328/3434509)\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - **Confusion with Violin Mode Harmonics**: Concerns were expressed about the classification of some glitches as Violin Mode Harmonic when they appear at 11Hz, which is not typical for this category. The discussions indicate a misunderstanding or misclassification, suggesting a need to refine how these glitches are categorized or described to avoid placing them incorrectly under Violin Mode Harmonic. (URL for reference: /328/3430854)\n   - **Inconsistency in Classifying New Types**: There are several mentions of glitches that do not fit into any existing classes, leading to frequent usage of None Of The Above (NOTA). This highlights a concern that existing classifications may not be comprehensive enough to cover newly observed phenomena, suggesting a need for ongoing revision and expansion of the glitch classification taxonomy. (URLs for reference: /328/3430133, /328/3430538)\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - **Questions about the Specificity of Data Channels**: There are emerging questions regarding the roles of specific data channels in capturing glitches, particularly whether certain channels might provide more detailed or specific observations of glitches. This curiosity stems from a deeper engagement with the technical infrastructure of gravitational wave detection and a desire to optimize the analysis of observed data. (URL for reference: /328/3431042)\n   - **Inquiries Into Detailed Glitch Characteristics**: Questions are arising about the detailed characteristics of certain glitches, such as the exact conditions under which they appear and their frequency-specific behaviors. This indicates a growing sophistication in the citizen scientists' approach to glitch classification and a deeper interest in the physics of gravitational wave detection. (URL for reference: /328/3430142)\n\n4. **Specific Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Environmental Couplings**: There's a hypothesis that ground or floor motion coupling, particularly around 60Hz, might be influencing the detection of gravitational waves. This hypothesis is motivated by observations of correlated signals in gravitational strain measurements and accelerometer data, suggesting that vibrations from nearby machinery or structural movements could be coupling into sensitive measurements. (URL for reference: /328/3433257)\n   - **Dust Particles Impacting Beam**: Another hypothesis discusses the potential for single dust grains falling through the beam path as a cause of loud glitches. This hypothesis is based on the understanding of the physical environment within the beam tubes and the potential for microscopic particles to disturb the laser path, despite the vacuum conditions. (URL for reference: /329/3431042)\n\n5. **Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Specificity of Sensors in Detecting Glitches**: There are discussions concerning whether specific sensors or auxiliary channels might be more effective or sensitive in detecting certain types of glitches. This line of questioning reflects a nuanced exploration of the apparatus and a desire to understand how different components contribute to the overall detection capabilities. (URL for reference: /329/3431042)\n   - **Effectiveness of Channels in Glitch Analysis**: Questions are raised about the effectiveness of certain data channels in providing clear and usable data for glitch analysis, especially in the context of identifying and classifying new or unusual glitches. This reflects a deeper engagement with the technical setup and an interest in optimizing data usage for better scientific outcomes.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

Mention of the "fuzzy range" is recurrent, suggesting a type of glitch that does not neatly fit into previously known categories. It is described with characteristics such as lacking the "tell tale eyes" of Power Line glitches and often appearing in contexts where traditional glitch categories fail to apply. This glitch seems to be associated with a variety of frequencies and is frequently mentioned across different subjects and conditions.\n     - URL references: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3462091/, https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3462098/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - **Misclassification Issues**: In Talk Dataset 2, there are mentions of ongoing issues with misclassifications, particularly with the Power Line glitch. The discussions indicate that some glitches, especially those peaking near 60Hz and rendered at high Q, resemble Power Lines but aren\'t actually Power Lines, leading to misclassification in entry-level workflows.\n   - **Broadening of Existing Classes**: There is a suggestion that the classification scheme needs revision to encompass additional forms of scattering involving vibrating items, as opposed to slower pendulum motions. This indicates a concern that existing classes may not adequately cover all observed phenomena.\n     - URL references: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3462091/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - **Training Sets and Machine Learning**: There is significant discussion in Talk Dataset 2 about the creation and application of training sets for machine learning, suggesting a deepening interest and sophistication in understanding how glitches are classified automatically. Questions arise about how these training sets can be optimized to improve classification accuracy.\n   - **Sensor-Specific Differences**: Discussions include observations that glitches from different LIGO sites (Hanford vs. Livingston) appear subtly different, prompting questions about site-specific environmental influences or equipment variations affecting the data.\n   - **Reevaluation of Glitch Characteristics**: Participants question the boundaries between certain glitch classes, such as between Blip and Low-Frequency Blip, indicating a desire to refine the understanding and categorization based on frequency and appearance characteristics.\n     - URL references: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3462091/\n\n4. **Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Environmental Influences**: There is a hypothesis proposing that differences in glitch appearances between different LIGO sites may be due to varying local environmental conditions such as seismic activities or infrastructure vibrations. This reflects a deeper dive into correlating external conditions with observed data anomalies.\n   - **Equipment Interactions**: Another hypothesis discussed involves the interaction between the test mass suspensions and electromagnetic coils, particularly during transitions between high power and low noise operational modes. This underscores an analytical approach to understanding how operational modes of LIGO equipment might precipitate certain glitches.\n     - URL references: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3462091/\n\n5. **Questions or Thoughts Concerning Glitch Connection to Sensors or Channels:**\n   - **Sensor-Specific Glitch Characteristics**: In Talk Dataset 2, there is an ongoing analysis and questioning of whether the physical characteristics or settings of specific sensors (at Hanford vs. Livingston, for instance) might lead to different types of glitches. This suggests a nuanced understanding that the same glitch might appear differently depending on the sensor characteristics or setup.\n   - **Channel-Specific Issues**: Discussions include concerns about whether specific channels within the LIGO apparatus might be more susceptible to certain types of glitches or noise, indicating a growing sophistication in understanding the detailed workings of the detectors.\n     - URL references: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3462091/\n\nThese insights reflect a maturing dialogue among citizen scientists, who are not only categorizing and identifying glitches but also engaging deeply with the technical and theoretical aspects of gravitational wave science.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1728945530, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_4dba7dd7b3', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=884, prompt_tokens=7198, total_tokens=8082, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0}))

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

These are described based on their appearance and frequency characteristics, differing subtly in appearance and probably not having the same cause as similar glitches in other known categories. This class aims to encompass variations which do not clearly fit into existing definitions, providing a more comprehensive classification framework for analyzing LIGO data.\n   - URLs: [Fuzzy Range Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3462091/), [Training Set Description](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/762/3314162/)\n\n### Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n1. **Misclassification Concerns**\n   - In Dataset 2, concerns about misclassification are evident, especially with "Power Line" glitches. Participants express difficulties due to the appearance of some glitches like Power Lines but which are actually not, leading to high rates of misclassification in lower-level workflows. This issue underlines the necessity for constant review and potential recalibration of the classifying algorithms used within the citizen science project.\n   - URLs: [Power Line Misclassification](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3462091/)\n\n### Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects\n1. **Queries on Specific Glitch Properties and Classifications**\n   - In Dataset 2, there is a notable increase in discussions focusing on the specific properties of glitches, such as frequency and Q-value (quality factor), and how these properties influence the classification process. Questions arise on whether certain observed properties necessitate the creation of new classes or the adjustment of existing ones, reflecting a deeper engagement with the technical aspects of glitch analysis.\n   - URLs: [Discussion on Glitch Properties](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3462098/), [Classification Challenges](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3462091/)\n\n### Hypotheses on Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2\n1. **External Environmental Factors**\n   - Talk Dataset 2 contains more specific hypotheses about the origins of glitches, with discussions suggesting that variations in environmental conditions such as earthquakes or specific operational modes of LIGO could be linked to certain glitch appearances. For instance, the "Fuzzy Range" glitches are hypothesized to potentially stem from different causes at different LIGO sites, indicating a localized environmental impact on the data collected.\n   - URLs: [Environmental Impact Hypothesis](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3462091/), [Operational Modes Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3461469/)\n\n### Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels\n1. **Sensor-Specific Issues**\n   - In Dataset 2, there is an increase in the discussion regarding whether specific sensors or channels might be more prone to certain types of glitches. This reflects a growing curiosity about the hardware side of LIGO and its influence on data integrity. Questions like these highlight an evolving understanding among citizen scientists of how instrumental specifics can influence scientific observations.\n   - URLs: [Sensor Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3462098/), [Channel Specific Queries](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3461469/) \n\nThese responses outline how Talk Dataset 2 demonstrates an evolution in the complexity and depth of discussions among citizen scientists, showing a trend towards more sophisticated questions and hypotheses regarding LIGO\'s glitch phenomena.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1729025192, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_83975a045a', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=815, prompt_tokens=7198, total_tokens=8013, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0}))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

It is linked with "Scattered light plus a Marie Celeste appearing stage right at 4s." This description implies a glitch manifestation that is sudden and without clear causation, appearing transiently and then vanishing.  \n   - **URL**: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463362/\n\n### Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n\n1. **Confusion about Class Boundaries**: In Talk Dataset 2, there are expressions of confusion regarding the boundaries of existing glitch classes. For example, a user contemplates the classification differences between "Blip" and "Low Frequency Blip," discussing the frequency and height of the glitch, which reflects ongoing uncertainty about how to classify edge-case glitches.  \n   - **URL**: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3459088/\n\n### Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects\n\n1. **Workflow Confusion**: In Talk Dataset 2, there\'s an emerging question about the appropriate workflow, indicating a need for clearer guidance on handling different types of glitches. A user expresses confusion about which workflow to use, reflecting a deeper need for understanding how different glitches fit into the broader scientific investigation.\n   - **URL**: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3469427/\n\n2. **Nature of "Invisible Violins" Glitch**: There\'s a curiosity about the "Invisible Violins" glitch, where a user questions how this class is defined and what physical phenomena it corresponds to.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

It appears in the context of scattered light with a specific appearance noted at a particular time (4 seconds mark). The name seems inspired by the mysterious historical context of the ship Marie Celeste, suggesting a fleeting or elusive glitch characteristic.\n   - Another proposed glitch class is the "Terracotta Warriors." This name could be derived from its appearance, possibly suggesting glitches that are structured and aligned akin to the historical Terracotta Warrior statues, indicating a sequence or formation in the data.\n   - URLs contributing to the response: \n     - [Marie Celeste](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463362/)\n     - [Terracotta Warriors](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463598/)\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - There is an expressed need for revising the broad categories of existing glitch classes. For instance, the discussion around "Fuzzy range" suggests that the current classifications may not adequately or accurately describe some observed phenomena, indicating a possible misfit with existing categories and calling for a more nuanced or revised classification approach.\n   - URLs contributing to the response:\n     - [Fuzzy Range Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3468496/)\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there’s curiosity about the assignment and accuracy of machine learning classifications with questions about the operational integrity of workflows, revealing a desire to understand the technical underpinnings that influence glitch categorization and their appearance in different workflows.\n   - These queries reflect a deeper engagement with the platform’s backend processes, including machine learning application, indicating an evolving understanding and interest in the technical side of data handling and classification.\n   - URLs contributing to the response:\n     - [Workflow and Machine Learning Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3469427/)\n\n4. **Hypotheses about Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - A specific hypothesis mentioned relates to local seismic activity potentially causing observed glitches, labeled as "Richland WA earthquake." This suggests a direct correlation between environmental seismic events and glitch signatures, highlighting an increasing sophistication in linking external physical phenomena with data anomalies.\n   - Another hypothesis concerns the correlation of glitches with operational modes of electromagnetic coils and electrostatic devices, which influence test mass suspensions in LIGO. This represents a deeper dive into understanding the technical operations and their impacts on data integrity.\n   - URLs contributing to the response:\n     - [Seismic Activity Hypothesis](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3464772/)\n     - [Operational Modes Hypothesis](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3461469/)\n\n5. **Sensor or Channel Specific Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - There are emerging discussions on how specific glitches might be linked to particular sensors or operational channels within LIGO, such as inquiries into whether the observed glitches are connected to specific test mass actuations or to disturbances in electromagnetic and electrostatic control mechanisms.\n   - This indicates a growing technical acuity among citizen scientists, as they link observed data anomalies to specific components or operational conditions within the LIGO instrumentation framework.\n   - URLs contributing to the response:\n     - [Sensor Specific Discussion](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3461469/)', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1729025539, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_83975a045a', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=795, prompt_tokens=7308, total_tokens=8103, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0}))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

Proposed New Glitch Classes in Talk Dataset 2\n\n- **Marie Celeste**: This glitch appears as a new mention in Dataset 2, with its characteristics described as appearing "stage right at 4s" in the context of scattered light. This description suggests a visual anomaly that appears transiently at a specific time frame within the data, which is different from other known glitches that have more stable or defined appearances.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463362/\n  \n### 2. Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n\n- **Questioning the Blip and LF Blip Classes**: In Dataset 2, there is a discussion about the boundary between Blip and LF Blip. The citizen scientist debates the frequency and shape criteria that differentiate these two classes, indicating a need for clearer or perhaps updated definitions to accommodate new observations that don\'t neatly fit existing categories.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3468652/\n\n### 3. Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects\n\n- **Workflow Confusion**: A citizen scientist expresses confusion about which workflow they should be operating in, questioning the classification framework\'s current structure. This reflects a deeper inquiry into how the classification processes are organized and whether they adequately meet the needs of the evolving nature of observed glitches.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3469427/\n  \n- **Frequency Bins and Subject Preparation**: Discussions in Dataset 2 reveal emerging questions about changes in frequency bins and subject preparation methods. This curiosity stems from observations of how glitches are categorized differently than in previous observations, suggesting an adaptative learning approach towards understanding gravitational wave detection.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3470496/\n\n### 4. Hypotheses About Glitch Origins\n\n- **Earthquake Correlation**: In Dataset 2, there is a hypothesis suggesting that certain glitches may be correlated with earthquake events, as indicated by specific "repeating whistle shape" glitches collected during such times. This hypothesis is driven by the analytical motivation to understand environmental impacts on sensor readings, potentially providing insights into how terrestrial vibrations affect gravitational wave measurements.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3470741/\n\n### 5. Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels\n\n- **Specific Sensor-Related Issues**: Dataset 2 includes a detailed analysis about a glitch potentially caused by ground motion, mentioning specific sensors at LHO (LIGO Hanford Observatory). The discussion pinpoints how disturbances in upper masses might travel down to affect test masses, questioning the sensor\'s response to environmental vibrations and the subsequent data capture.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3461469/\n\nThese points illustrate how citizen scientists in Dataset 2 are engaging deeply with the classification, technical understanding, and hypothesizing about the origins of glitches in gravitational wave data. Their discussions reflect a maturing knowledge base and a drive to refine and expand the existing glitch classification system.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1729025760, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_4dba7dd7b3', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=683, prompt_tokens=7308, total_tokens=7991, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0}))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

This descriptor suggests that the glitch has characteristics of appearing momentarily and then disappearing, much like the historical mystery of the Marie Celeste ship. This proposed class reflects a glitch that is transient and unexplained, making it distinct from previously recognized persistent or cyclic glitches.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463362/\n   - **Terracotta Warriors**: Mentioned as emerging from observations, this glitch class is notably named after the famous Terracotta Warriors, suggesting a glitch appearance that is structured and aligned, resembling the historical formation of the warriors. This indicates a regular, possibly linear pattern of glitches that stand out distinctly from more random or scattered glitch types.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463598/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - **Mislabeling in Levels and Workflows**: Participants in Talk Dataset 2 express concerns about glitches that are mislabeled, particularly noting that many could not be accurately classified within the existing glitch categories. They point out that erroneous labeling across different levels of analysis has led to a "junkyard" of misidentified glitches, which complicates further analysis and proper classification of new data.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3469427/\n   - **Ambiguity in Low Frequency and High Frequency Blip Definitions**: There is also a discussion about the distinction between Blips and Low Frequency Blips, where the community debates on the frequency range that should define each class effectively. This confusion affects the accuracy of classifying and understanding glitch behaviors.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3459088/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - **Questions on Workflow Classification Consistency**: There\'s a noticeable query about the consistency in how glitches are assigned to workflows, reflecting a deeper inquiry into the machine learning models used in classifying glitches. Participants are trying to understand why certain glitches appear in unexpected workflows, which could indicate underlying flaws or necessary improvements in classification algorithms.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3469427/\n   - **Inquiry into Glitch Characteristics and Sensor Responses**: Participants question the sensor reactions to different glitch types, especially when unexpected patterns like "Visible Violins" appear. They seek to understand how such patterns are related to the actual mechanical or environmental influences on the LIGO detectors.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3461469/\n\n4. **Specific Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **Environmental Influences on Sensor Reactions**: A hypothesis is discussed regarding ground motion near the sensors, possibly influencing the appearance of glitches. This involves detailed observation of correlated environmental conditions such as earthquakes and their timestamps relative to glitch occurrences, suggesting a direct environmental impact on sensor readings.\n     - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3464772/\n   - **Sensor Saturation and Correction Delays**: Another hypothesis revolves around the saturation of actuators during disturbances and how the sensors\' corrective responses are delayed or inadequate under certain conditions.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

This terminology suggests a type of glitch that appears suddenly and mysteriously like the legend of the ghost ship Marie Celeste. The unique temporal and spatial characteristics of this glitch could indicate a new class that captures sudden, transient anomalies.  \n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463362/\n\n2. **School of Koi Glitch**: Although "Koi Fish" is a known glitch type, the "School of Koi" might suggest a cluster or group of such glitches manifesting simultaneously or in quick succession, indicating a possibly different or more complex underlying cause than individual "Koi Fish" glitches. \n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463371/\n\n3. **Terracotta Warriors Glitch**: This appears to be a new classification where the glitches are described metaphorically, possibly indicating multiple, closely aligned glitches resembling the historical Chinese Terracotta Warriors. This could suggest a structured array of glitches with similar characteristics occurring in a sequence or formation.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463598/\n\n### Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n\n1. **Uncertainty in Classification**: In Talk Dataset 2, there’s a recurring theme of uncertainty and confusion about whether specific observations fit known categories like "Blip" or "Fuzzy Range". For example, a discussion whether a feature should be classified under "Fuzzy Range" or another category indicates ongoing challenges in applying existing classifications consistently.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3468496/\n\n2. **Mislabeling Concerns**: Citizens express concerns about mislabeling, where glitches like "Power Lines" are found in inappropriate categories, indicating issues with the classification algorithms or the initial labeling process. This suggests that the existing classes might not accommodate all observable variations, leading to incorrect or forced categorizations.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3469427/\n\n### Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects\n\n1. **Workflow and Classification Questions**: In Talk Dataset 2, there are direct questions about the workflow and whether certain observations should be classified under extremely loud glitches or another category. This reflects a deeper engagement with the classification process and an interest in the technical criteria that define each class.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3469427/\n\n2. **Request for Clarification on Glitch Characteristics**: Questions regarding the specific characteristics that define classes like "Blip" versus "Low Frequency Blip" indicate a desire to understand the finer distinctions between similar glitch categories. This deeper inquiry suggests that citizen scientists are looking to refine their skills in glitch identification and classification.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3459088/\n\n3. **Inquiries about Technical Changes in Data Handling**: There are queries about changes in frequency bins and the handling of data, such as why "Power Line glitches" are reported at different frequencies. This indicates a pursuit of understanding about how data processing and technical adjustments might affect glitch observations.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3470496/\n\n### Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2\n\n1. **Environmental Hypothesis for "Terracotta Warriors"**: The hypothesis that environmental conditions might be leading to glitches appearing as structured arrays (like Terracotta Warriors) reflects an attempt to correlate external factors such as seismic activity or anthropogenic disturbances with observed data patterns.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463598/\n\n2. **Earthquake Induced Glitches**: Discussions about glitches resembling the effects of earthquakes suggest hypotheses that these are directly influenced by geological events. This situates glitches within a broader context of natural environmental interactions affecting the sensors.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3470741/\n\n### Questions Concerning Specific Sensors or Channels\n\n1. **Sensor-Specific Glitch Queries**: There are discussions about whether certain glitches are specifically related to particular sensors at LIGO sites, reflecting a nuanced approach to understanding how different components of the detector array might be differently affected or might respond uniquely to external influences.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3461469/\n\nThis analysis of the Talk Datasets highlights an active and evolving participation by citizen scientists in the categorization and understanding of glitches, underscored by their proposals for new glitch classes and deeper inquiries into the nature and origins of these anomalies.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1729026216, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_83975a045a', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=1074, prompt_tokens=7308, total_tokens=8382, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0}))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.
    
GRAVITYBOT RESPONSE:
ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-AIj2dSo0sz7vZM1YWBEfEz5e3RvIw', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='1. **Novel Glitch Classes in Talk Dataset 2:**\n   - **"Marie Celeste"** is a new glitch class mentioned in Talk Dataset 2, described as appearing "stage right at 4s". This glitch class is introduced along with speculative discussions on its features and naming, reflecting an ongoing development in categorizing new types of glitches observed in the LIGO data. The name seems to hint at a mysterious or unexplained appearance akin to the ghost ship Marie Celeste. \n   - **URLs contributing to the response:** https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463362/\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, concerns about the adequacy of existing glitch classifications are evident. For instance, there is mention of the "Tomte" glitch class, questioning if it should include the lower frequency blips traditionally not classified under "Tomte." This reflects a broader conversation on whether current classifications adequately capture the range of observed phenomena. \n   - **URLs contributing to the response:** https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3468507/\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, one significant emerging question relates to the assignment of glitches to classifications, with volunteers querying the process by which glitches are categorized, especially when they encounter glitches that do not fit neatly into predefined categories. For example, discussions around how "Violin Mode Harmonic" differs in its manifestation and whether certain observed glitches should fall into this category highlight a deeper engagement with understanding the technical nuances of glitch categorization.\n   - **URLs contributing to the response:** https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3468652/\n\n4. **Hypotheses about Glitch Origins:**\n   - Talk Dataset 2 contains a hypothesis related to the "Marie Celeste" glitch, suggesting that it might be associated with specific environmental conditions or instrumental configurations at the LIGO detectors during certain times. This hypothesis stems from observing the glitch\'s appearance during specific segments of data collection, motivating a deeper analysis of environmental or operational parameters that might influence such observations.\n   - **URLs contributing to the response:** https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463362/\n\n5. **Questions Relating to Sensors or Channels:**\n   - In Talk Dataset 2, there are discussions about the possible influences of specific LIGO sensors or channels on the observed glitches, particularly in relation to the "Marie Celeste" glitch. Questions arise about whether particular sensors or data channels might be more susceptible to certain types of noise or glitches, suggesting a need to examine the hardware or data processing channels closely.\n   - **URLs contributing to the response:** https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463362/', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1729026407, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_83975a045a', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=631, prompt_tokens=7308, total_tokens=7939, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0}))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

New Glitch Classes Proposed in Talk Dataset 2:\n\n- **Terracotta Warriors**: In Talk Dataset 2, a new glitch class named "Terracotta Warriors" is proposed. This glitch appears to involve overlapping double features, as indicated by a user noting the close resemblance to the famous statues, hinting at visual patterns similar to closely standing figures. This novel classification suggests intriguing new visual patterns in the glitch data.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463598/\n\n### 2. Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:\n\n- **Boundary Confusion**: There\'s an ongoing discussion about the boundary confusion between "Blip" and "Low Frequency Blip" classes. The rule of thumb mentioned involves frequency and visual height proportion, suggesting an ambiguity in existing classes based on visual inspection and spectral features, highlighting the need for clearer distinctions or revised classifications.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3459088/\n\n- **Class Coverage and Mislabeling**: In Talk Dataset 2, there\'s a mention of the need to reconsider and potentially broaden the classification scheme to cover more types of scattering and other phenomena currently not well captured by existing classes. This reflects concerns about the adequacy of the current classification system to handle the variety of observed glitches.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3419834/\n\n### 3. Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:\n\n- **Questions on Workflow and Class Assignments**: Citizen scientists express confusion about workflow assignments and how glitches fit into current classification schemes, particularly wondering if the classification workflow they are using is correct given the changing nature of glitch characteristics observed in the latest data. This indicates a need for clarity on the relationship between observed data properties and their classification workflow.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3469427/\n\n- **Request for Clarification on "Visibility" of Glitches**: There\'s curiosity about the visibility of certain types of glitches such as "Violin Modes", and how they appear in different operational modes or under different conditions. Such questions exemplify a deeper dive into understanding the physical manifestations and characteristics of glitches in operational contexts.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3461469/\n\n### 4. Hypotheses on Glitch Origins:\n\n- **Ground Motion Hypothesis**: In Talk Dataset 2, a hypothesis is discussed regarding glitches being caused by ground motion, specifically detailing how test mass suspensions might react during such events, and hypothesizing about the transfer of disturbances through suspension fibers. This reflects a nuanced understanding of the mechanical and operational dynamics of LIGO\'s sensors under environmental disturbances.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3461469/\n\n- **Local Earthquake Influence**: Another hypothesis considers the influence of a local earthquake at Richland, WA, on the glitches observed. This type of hypothesis illustrates a targeted attempt to correlate local geophysical events with specific glitch patterns observed in the data, suggesting a localized external environmental influence on the glitch occurrences.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3464772/\n\n### 5. Questions Concerning Sensors or Channels:\n\n- **Specific Sensor-Related Queries**: There\'s a discussion about whether particular sensors or channels are specifically associated with certain glitches, with questions about whether glitches like those observed in "Terracotta Warriors" could be tied to specific operational conditions or sensor channels. This points to a search for deeper understanding of the hardware-specific origins of observed data anomalies.\n  - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463598/', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1729029694, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_4dba7dd7b3', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=831, prompt_tokens=7308, total_tokens=8139, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0}))

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

The name evokes the famous ghost ship known for being mysteriously abandoned, suggesting an elusive or transient glitch presence.\n   - **Ripple Comb**: Mentioned as a novel category, the classification seems to relate to a pattern that resembles a comb with regular ripples, potentially indicating a regular periodic disturbance or interference in the data.\n   - **Terracotta Warriors**: This glitch class is noted for the appearance of closely overlapping double glitches. The name is inspired by the famous Terracotta Army, suggesting a glitch that appears in well-formed, ordered ranks similar to the historical figures.\n\n   URLs involved:\n   - Marie Celeste: [https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463362/](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463362/)\n   - Ripple Comb: [https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463363/](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463363/)\n   - Terracotta Warriors: [https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463598/](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463598/)\n\n2. **Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes:**\n   - **Confusion between Blip and LF Blip**: Citizens discuss the ambiguity in distinguishing between 'Blip' and 'Low Frequency (LF) Blip'. The criteria based on frequency and shape are questioned, indicating a need for clearer definitions or additional subclassifications within these categories.\n   - **Mislabeling in Machine Learning Models**: There are concerns about the current machine learning models mislabeling glitches, such as many non-Whistle glitches being labeled as Whistle. This misclassification affects the sorting of data and could impede accurate analysis and tracking of glitch patterns.\n\n   URLs involved:\n   - Blip and LF Blip: [https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3459088/](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3459088/)\n   - Machine Learning Mislabeling: [https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3469427/](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3469427/)\n\n3. **Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Technical Aspects:**\n   - **Workflow Confusion**: There is confusion about which workflow is appropriate for certain observations, indicating a lack of clarity on the procedural aspects and raising questions about the organization and categorization within the project.\n   - **Queries on Glitch Origins**: Questions are raised about the specific origins of certain glitches, such as whether a glitch could be traced back to an earthquake.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

This glitch appeared as an unexpected character in the data, similar to the sudden abandonment of the Marie Celeste ship. The description suggests a peculiar appearance or behavior in the glitch that might differentiate it from other known categories.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463362/\n\n2. **"Terracotta Warriors" Glitch Class**: Another intriguingly named proposed class is "Terracotta Warriors." This name suggests a glitch that appears regimented and orderly, much like the historic terracotta warrior statues. The classification discussion likely revolves around the structured appearance or repetitive nature of these glitches.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3463598/\n\n### Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes\n\n1. **Confusion Over Class Boundaries**: In Talk Dataset 2, there\'s concern about the boundaries between existing glitch classes, such as "Blip" and "Low Frequency Blip." These distinctions are crucial as they impact how glitches are categorized and studied. The dialogue reflects ongoing debates about how to fine-tune these definitions to better fit the observed data.\n   - URL: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy/talk/328/3468496/\n\n2. **Mislabeling in Workflows**: There is a voiced concern regarding the mislabeling of glitches due to flawed machine learning labels, leading to glitches being placed incorrectly within workflows.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.

SYSTEM PROMPT:

    You are a technical interpreter who translates citizen science forum conversations for physicists and engineers. You are to describe particulars of where this ambiguity appears to come from.
    
User Prompt: 
    The following data are from citizen scientists identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. The data originally were in a pandas dataframe of two columns. The first column was the "comment" text and the second was the "URL" affiliated with that comment. After having converted this pandas dataframe to string, each comment is now followed by its URL. 
    
    The citizen scientists investigate underlying causes of various types of glitches observed in the LIGO sensors. I am trying to capture the evolving nature of glitch classification, the needs for new classifications, and novel exploration of glitch origins and characteristics by citizen scientists and researchers. The Talk data emerges as a part of significant curiosity and engagement with the data, with the need for a clear summary.

    I want a list of novel things which occur in Talk Dataset 2 realtive to Talk Dataset 1.
    1. Citizen scientists are actively identifying and categorizing new types of glitches based on their unique characteristics. I want to know what new glitch classes are proposed. If Talk data set 2 proposes a new glitch class realtive to Talk data set 1, what is the glitch class? How do they describe this glitch class? Provide at least a bullet point for each proposed new glitch class with at least two sentences describing it.

    2. Citizen scientists sometimes question whether there are problems with existing glitch classes: i.e. those listed. I am interested in whether there are any concerns regarding the glitch classes according to the citizen scientists, and whether or not they persist in both sets of Talk Datasets, or if concerns occur only in Talk Dataset 2. If there are concerns, what problems are they claiming exist with the classifcations? Provide at least a couple of sentences describing each concern raised.

    3. Additionally, citizen scientists wish to deepen their knowledge by exploring and learning classifications and technical aspects of glitches. I am interested in whether there are emerging questions related to the glitch classes, sensors, or gravitational wave science in Talk data set 2 relative to Talk data set 1. Describe each question and the reasoning for the question. Provide at least three sentences describing these emerging questions.

    4. The origins of glitches are usually related to enviornemntal factors near the sensors or errors in measurements of sensors themselves. Citizen scientists often attempt to analytically correlate external conditions with glitch occurrences, providing specific hypothetical origins of glitches suggesting potentially gained knowledge in underlying mechanisms of glitch causes or their appearances in spectograms. If Talk data set 2 has more specific hypotheses about where glitch origins, what are these hypotheses? What is each hypothesis' analytical motivation? Provide at least three sentences describing each hypothesis.

    5. Often citizen scientists will question if issues are specifically related to particular sensors or channels. Are there any emerging questions or thoughts concerning the way particular glitches are connected to sensors or channels in Talk Dataset 2 relative to Talk Dataset 1? If these thoughts or questions exist, what specifically do they describe? Provide at least two sentences for these questions or thoughts.
