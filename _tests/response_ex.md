### 1. Proposed New Glitch Classes in Talk Dataset 2

**New Glitch Class Proposed:**
- **"Flock of Blips"**: This is a potential new glitch class mentioned in Talk Dataset 2. It is described in a context where multiple blips appear to cluster together in a way that could suggest a collective behavior or pattern distinct from previously known classes.

### 2. Concerns Regarding Existing Glitch Classes

**Concerns in Talk Dataset 2:**
- **Ambiguity in Classifying Glitches**: There are discussions about whether certain observations should be classified under known categories like "Koi Fish" or another category such as "Wheat Grass". This suggests a concern about the specificity and distinctiveness of existing glitch classes.

### 3. Emerging Questions Related to Glitch Classes and Gravitational Wave Science

**Questions in Talk Dataset 2:**
- **Question about Glitch Grouping**: There's an inquiry whether observed phenomena belong to a single glitch group or are separate events, reflecting a need for clarity in understanding how glitches are grouped or classified.

### 4. Hypotheses About Glitch Origins in Talk Dataset 2

**Specific Hypotheses:**
- **Environmental Influence on Glitch Occurrence**: There's a hypothesis that a lockloss event was influenced by an earthquake, suggesting a direct environmental impact on the sensor's ability to function properly. The analysis considers the timing of the earthquake relative to the glitch event, highlighting a correlation between natural events and observed glitches.

### 5. Questions or Thoughts Concerning Connection of Glitches to Specific Sensors or Channels

**Emerging Thoughts in Talk Dataset 2:**
- **Concerns About Data Processing Artifacts**: There's a mention of how high-frequency noise bands, indicative of glitches, could be artifacts from data processing methods rather than true sensor outputs. This suggests a need to discern between actual sensor data and processing-induced discrepancies.
